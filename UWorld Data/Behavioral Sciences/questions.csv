471,"When first memorizing neuroanatomical structures and their functions, a student associates the amygdala, which starts with the letters A-M-Y and is involved in processing emotions, with her ""emotional"" friend named Amy.  This scenario illustrates:",C,84,"Memory involves encoding, the transfer of information into long-term memory; storage (retaining the information); and retrieval (accessing the information).  Some information is processed automatically with little effort (eg, registering the characters on a license plate as letters or numbers), but to encode information, attention and effortful processing are often required (eg, encoding a specific license plate takes effort).
Elaboration is an example of an encoding strategy that can enhance memory.  With elaboration, new information is meaningfully associated with previously known information.  This effortful, deep processing tends to result in more connections to the new material, improving learning.
A scenario in which a student meaningfully associates the name and function of the amygdala (ie, new information) to her ""emotional"" friend named Amy (ie, previously known information) illustrates elaboration, an encoding strategy.
(Choice A)  The elaboration likelihood model (ELM) describes a message's persuasiveness based on how deeply or superficially it is processed and the characteristics of the audience (eg, motivation).  A scenario in which a student links new information to old information does not illustrate the ELM.
(Choice B)  The availability heuristic is the tendency to judge how common or likely something is based on how easily it is recalled (eg, assuming that shark attacks are common because one was recently reported on the news).  A scenario in which a student links new information to old information does not illustrate the availability heuristic.
(Choice D)  Associative learning is the linking of two events or stimuli.  For example, in operant conditioning, a behavior is associated with a consequence (ie, reinforcement or punishment).  A scenario in which a student links new information to old information does not illustrate associative learning.
Educational objective:
Encoding involves the transfer of information into long-term memory.  Information that is attended to and processed more deeply tends to be remembered better."
472,Which statement is NOT accurate regarding human social behavior?,B,84,"Attachment styles
Secure
Insecure
Develops from sensitive, responsive caregivers
Infants readily explore a new environment when caregiver is near
Infants are distressed by a caregiver leaving & comforted on return
Associated with better long-term effects (eg, more satisfaction in adult relationships, greater health outcomes)
Develops from insensitive, unresponsive caregivers
In a new environment, infants are apathetic or overly clingy toward caregiver
Infants are indifferent to, or not comforted by, a caregiver's return
Associated with worse long-term effects (eg, less satisfaction in adult relationships, poorer health outcomes)
Attachment styles, which reflect the emotional bond between child and caregiver, are not formed during the first few hours after birth but rather form during the first few years of life as a result of repeated interactions.  The nature of this ongoing contact between child and caregiver can produce a secure or insecure attachment style.
Secure attachment typically results when caregivers are sensitive and responsive to a child's emotional needs (eg, readily soothing an upset infant).  Securely attached children develop confidence in their ability to explore the world around them and return to their caregivers as a consistent and nurturing base.
Insecure attachment can develop when caregivers do not consistently respond to a child's emotional needs (eg, often ignoring the infant).  Insecurely attached children do not develop confidence in their caregivers' ability to meet their needs, may act indifferent or clingy towards them, and may show little exploration overall.
(Choice A)  Early attachment styles impact an individual's relationships and well-being throughout their lifetime.  For example, individuals with a secure attachment style show less depression and drug abuse as adolescents and tend to be more satisfied with their romantic relationships as adults.
(Choice C)  Sensitive and responsive caregiving does tend to result in more secure attachments.
(Choice D)  Stranger anxiety, psychological distress caused by contact with unfamiliar individuals, peaks around age 1 year and declines as a child matures.  Stranger anxiety is a normal developmental milestone for infants.
Educational objective:
Attachment is the emotional bond between a child and caregiver.  Securely attached children typically have sensitive, responsive caregivers and are more confident in their ability to explore their environment.  Insecurely attached children typically have insensitive, inconsistent caregivers to which they act indifferent or clingy and are less likely to freely explore their environment."
473,"In a two-part procedure for teaching children with diabetes to self-inject insulin, a child is first shown a video of same-aged peers self-injecting insulin and is then given a sticker for each attempt to self-inject.  This procedure utilizes:",D,84,"Types of learning
Operant conditioning
Occurs when the likelihood of repeating a behavior is influenced by the outcome of that behavior
Classical conditioning
Occurs when a stimulus that did not previously elicit a meaningful response takes on the properties of a biologically arousing stimulus after being paired
Observational learning
Occurs as the result of watching others engage in a behavior
Observational learning occurs as the result of watching others engage in a behavior.  For example, a child learns how to self-inject insulin by watching peers self-inject in a video.  There are four processes critical to observational learning: attention (focusing on others' behavior), retention (storing observations in memory), reproduction (imitating others' behavior), and motivation (incentive to imitate behavior).
Operant conditioning occurs when the likelihood of repeating a behavior is influenced by a consequence (ie, reinforcement or punishment).  Positive reinforcement increases/maintains behavior through the application of a desirable stimulus (ie, reinforcer).  Primary reinforcers are naturally rewarding (eg, candy), whereas secondary reinforcers are conditioned to be desirable (eg, stickers).
Therefore, a child learning to self-inject insulin by watching peers utilizes observational learning and rewarding the child with a sticker for attempting to self-inject utilizes secondary reinforcement.
(Choices A and B)  Classical conditioning occurs when a neutral stimulus that did not previously elicit a response takes on the properties of a biologically arousing (ie, unconditioned) stimulus after being paired (eg, infant fears a white toy rat after it is paired with a loud noise).  The procedure does not utilize classical conditioning.
(Choices B and C)  In a token economy, certain behaviors (eg, completing homework) are positively reinforced through the use of tokens (eg, gold stars), which are secondary reinforcers that can be exchanged for a desirable reward (eg, 5 gold stars can be exchanged for candy).  The procedure does not involve trading in secondary reinforcers for a desirable reward, so it is not utilizing a token economy.
Educational objective:
Observational learning occurs as the result of watching others.  Primary reinforcers are naturally rewarding (eg, food), whereas secondary reinforcers are conditioned to be desirable (eg, money)."
474,"A 34-year-old patient describes a history of conflict-ridden interpersonal relationships.  This pattern has been present since late adolescence, occurs across all settings, and has resulted in a history of sporadic employment and tumultuous romantic relationships.  The symptoms are not due to a medical condition or the use of a substance.  Which psychological diagnosis is most likely in this patient?",D,84,"Personality disorders are characterized by inflexible and enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that differ markedly from social norms and cause functional impairment.  Individuals with personality disorders have pathological personal traits (eg, rigidity, greediness) and maladaptive patterns of relating to others (eg, hostility, superficiality) that are stable over time and across situations.
For someone with a pattern of conflict-ridden interpersonal relationships in all settings since late adolescence (ie, stable over time), resulting in a history of sporadic employment and tumultuous romantic relationships (ie, significant impairment), the most likely diagnosis is a personality disorder.
(Choice A)  Mood disorders (eg, depression) are characterized by persistent disruptions in emotional state.  Although individuals with mood disorders may experience social dysfunction (eg, lack of interest in socializing), this is a result of their mood symptomology, not an inflexible and enduring pattern of relating to others (ie, personality disorder).
(Choice B)  Anxiety disorders (eg, generalized anxiety disorder) are characterized by excessive worry.  Although individuals with anxiety disorders may experience social dysfunction (eg, declining social invitations due to anxiety), this is a result of their excessive worry, not an inflexible and enduring pattern of relating to others (ie, personality disorder).
(Choice C)  Dissociative disorders (eg, dissociative identity disorder) are characterized by disruptions in memory and identity.  Although individuals with dissociative disorders may experience social dysfunction (eg, through inconsistent interactions with loved ones), this is a result of their disruptions in memory and identity, not an inflexible and enduring pattern of relating to others (ie, personality disorder).
Educational objective:
Personality disorders are characterized by inflexible and enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors differing markedly from social norms.  Personality disorders are stable over time and across environments and cause significant distress or impairment of functioning."
475,Which of the following best illustrates a normative organization?,D,84,"In sociology, organizations are social structures composed of individuals linked by specific purposes, tasks, and/or common goals.  The three main types of organizations are normative, utilitarian, and coercive.
In normative organizations, people voluntarily unite based on shared values and/or goals (eg, church congregations, sororities).
In utilitarian organizations, members are compensated for their involvement, typically through money (eg, paid employment) or certification/diploma (eg, university students).
In coercive organizations, membership is not freely chosen (eg, prisoners) and/or maintained (eg, military service members must be discharged).
A humanitarian group composed of physician volunteers illustrates an organization in which members are united by shared values and/or goals (ie, a normative organization).
(Choices A and C)  Medical residents and business consultants are compensated for their efforts in a residency program and the workforce, respectively (ie, through certification, pay).  Therefore, both a medical residency program and an insurance company that employs physicians as consultants illustrate utilitarian, not normative, organizations.
(Choice B)  An inpatient psychiatric ward in which involuntarily committed patients are unable to leave as they choose (ie, they must be evaluated and cleared by staff) illustrates a coercive, not a normative, organization.
Educational objective:
Organizations are social structures composed of individuals linked by specific purposes, tasks, and/or common goals.  In normative organizations, people come together based on shared values/goals, whereas utilitarian organizations compensate members for their involvement.  In coercive organizations, membership is not freely chosen and/or maintained."
476,"A pharmaceutical company is testing how much sugar should be added to a pediatric oral liquid suspension to make the medication more palatable.  Researchers determine that adding 0.2 g of sugar to 20 mL of oral suspension Z results in children detecting a just noticeable difference in taste.  Based on Weber's law, should the addition of 0.2 g of sugar to 50 mL of oral suspension Z be detectable 50% of the time?",D,84,"The smallest difference between two stimuli a person can detect 50% of the time is called the just noticeable difference (JND), or difference threshold.  As the intensity of the original stimulus increases, the difference threshold also increases.  For example, although the difference between weights of 100 and 102 g may be detectable, the difference between weights of 500 and 502 g is not, even though the difference is also 2 g.
This relationship is quantified by Weber's law, which states that the ratio of the size of the JND to the original stimulus intensity remains constant.  In other words, the change in a stimulus needed to detect a difference is a constant proportion (ie, if one can just detect a difference between weights of 100 and 102 g, the difference between weights of 500 and 510 g would also be just detectable).
If the addition of 0.2 g of sugar to 20 mL of suspension Z is just noticeable 50% of the time, then for a volume that is 2.5 times bigger (20 mL × 2.5 = 50 mL), 0.5 g of sugar (0.2 g × 2.5 = 0.5 g) would be the JND.  Therefore, the addition of 0.2 g of sugar to 50 mL of oral suspension Z would not be detectable because Weber's law is based on a ratio.
(Choice A)  The addition of 0.2 g of sugar is the JND for 20 mL of suspension; for 50 mL of suspension the JND is 2.5 times greater, or 0.5 g.  Therefore, anything less than 0.5 g should not be detectable 50% of the time.
(Choice B)  Weber's law is based on a constant proportion, not a constant value, so the addition of 0.2 g of sugar to 50 mL of oral suspension Z should not be detectable 50% of the time.
(Choice C)  The absolute threshold is the intensity value at which an individual can detect a stimulus 50% of the time; 0.2 g represents the difference threshold, or the smallest difference between two stimuli that can be detected 50% of the time, not the absolute threshold.
Educational objective:
Weber's law states that the proportion of the just noticeable difference (the smallest difference between two stimuli a person can detect 50% of the time) to the original stimulus intensity is a constant."
483,A hospital administrator claims that her hospital operates as a meritocracy in regard to employee hiring and promotion.  Which of the following observations would most support this administrator's claim?  Employees are:,C,84,"A meritocracy is a system in which individuals with the most merit (eg, talent, ability, effort) progress and earn rewards.  In other words, factors such as prestige or social connections do not count in a meritocracy.  While meritocracy is often considered an ideal, there are very few truly meritocratic systems.
The claim that a hospital operates as a meritocracy in regard to employee hiring and promotion is best supported by a system where employee promotions are based entirely on merit, such as demonstrated skills or accomplishments, rather than on nonmerit factors, such as seniority (ie, time employed by hospital) (Choice A).
(Choice B)  Social capital includes the connections within one's social network that can help one advance, such as knowing individuals who already work at the hospital where one hopes to get a job.  In a meritocratic system, employees would be hired based purely on merit, rather than on referrals from their social network.
(Choice D)  Cultural capital describes all the nonfinancial and nonsocial network assets that confer advantage in society, such as the prestige of a medical training program from which one graduated.  In a meritocratic system, employees would be hired or promoted based purely on merit, rather than on their cultural capital.
Educational objective:
A meritocracy is a system in which those individuals with the most merit (eg, talent, ability, effort) progress and earn rewards."
484,Which of the following is NOT supported by the passage?,B,84,"In sociology, there is a distinction between religiosity and religious affiliation.  Religiosity refers to the extent to which a given religious doctrine is incorporated into all aspects of an individual's life (eg, beliefs, behaviors, identity).  Also referred to as religiousness, religiosity is the degree to which a person internalizes a religion.  For example, those who consider themselves Catholic and have a high degree of religiosity also demonstrate beliefs and behaviors that align with Catholicism, and ""being Catholic"" is an important part of their identity.
Religious affiliation describes an individual identifying with a religious group (eg, Catholics, Jews, Muslims).  Just because individuals identify with a religious group does not necessarily mean that they live their lives according to the principles or customs of that religion.  For example, many people consider themselves Catholic but do not attend church often or at all.
The second paragraph suggests that religious affiliation is linked to suicide: religious groups that place more value on people actively participating in the faith (religiosity) tend to have lower rates of suicide among members.  This is presumably due to members feeling a greater sense of embeddedness within their religious community.  Therefore, as religiosity increases, suicide attempts should decrease (not increase), reflecting a negative correlation.
(Choice A)  According to paragraph 2, there is a positive correlation between socioeconomic status (in particular, income) and the likelihood of committing suicide.
(Choice C)  Figure 1 indicates that suicide rates increase in a society during economic downturns and decrease during periods of economic prosperity.  In other words, there is a negative correlation between suicide attempts and improvements in the economy.
(Choice D)  According to paragraph 1, individuals are at the greatest risk of attempting suicide during or just after an inpatient stay at a psychiatric hospital.  Therefore, there is a negative correlation between suicide attempts and time from psychiatric hospital discharge.
Educational objective:
Religious affiliation describes an individual identifying with a religious group, whereas religiosity (or religiousness) is the degree to which an individual internalizes that religion, as demonstrated by the individual's beliefs, behaviors, and identity."
485,Durkheim describes a type of suicide committed by individuals who feel disconnected from society for not providing them a moral compass.  What is the societal condition that occurs when a society does not provide enough moral guidance to individuals?,A,84,"What society should provide:
Stability
Norms to guide behavior
Purpose, goals, values, morals
Anomie is a state of normlessness that occurs when a society fails to provide individuals with norms and values to guide behavior.  In an anomic society, individuals lack guidance and purpose and feel aimless or alienated from society.  Anomie is often the result of a shift or transition in society that causes instability, undermining current norms (before new norms arise to replace them).
Anomie variously impacts individuals within society based on which norms are undermined and how.  For example, during the Industrial Revolution, many individuals who moved to cities (a new way of life) experienced anomie, but those who remained in the countryside were less likely to be affected because the norms governing life prior to the Industrial Revolution were still in effect.
(Choice B)  Cultural relativism is the evaluation of a society's norms and values in comparison to itself instead of in comparison to another society.  Beliefs, values, norms, and practices are not considered good or bad but depend on the cultural context from which they arise.  The opposite of cultural relativism, ethnocentrism, judges the norms and values of one society as good or bad compared to those of another society.
(Choice C)  Relative deprivation describes feelings of discontent experienced by those who are being deprived of something to which they feel entitled.  For example, women were not allowed to vote in the United States before 1920, and as a result many felt deprived of this right of citizenship.  Relative deprivation often leads to social movements (eg, the suffrage movement) but does not describe societies that lack moral guidance.
(Choice D)  Deindividuation describes a process by which someone loses self-awareness in a group and behaves in a way that is out of character.  For example, a person who is not normally violent may engage in looting when part of an emotionally charged, riotous crowd.
Educational objective:
Anomie is a state of normlessness in society.  When the norms and values of a society are undermined and have yet to be replaced, the social system reaches the condition of anomie.  Individuals in an anomic society lack the guidance and purpose that society usually provides; as a result, they may feel less tied to society, aimless, or alienated."
486,Durkheim is most often associated with which sociological theory?,A,84,"The major theoretical approaches in sociology view society from either a macro-level or micro-level perspective.  Theories with a macro-level perspective look at how larger social structures (eg, education and health care systems) function in society and impact the lives of those living in that society.  Theories with a micro-level perspective look at how interactions between individuals (eg, teacher and student, doctor and patient) shape society.
Structural functionalism is a macro-level sociological perspective that compares society to a biological organism.  This theory proposes that, like the various organ systems attempting to maintain homeostasis in an organism, all aspects of society work together to maintain dynamic equilibrium (societal balance).  For example, the heath care system functions to keep people optimally healthy so that they can work and contribute to society, and the education system functions to teach and train people who will in turn contribute to society.  Émile Durkheim is the theorist most often associated with structural functionalism.
(Choice B)  Karl Marx and Max Weber are most often associated with conflict theory, a macro-level sociological perspective which argues that conflict between social classes in society is inevitable.
(Choice C)  Social constructionism is either a micro- or macro-level perspective that argues that members of a given society define what constitutes reality.  For instance, race is a social construct based arbitrarily on skin color.
(Choice D)  Charles Cooley and George Herbert Mead are most often associated with symbolic interactionism, which is a micro-level perspective that argues we attach meaning to symbols in society, and that interpersonal interaction is based on those symbols and meanings.
Educational objective:
In sociology, macro-level theories look at how social structures impact society, whereas micro-level theories look at how individual interactions shape society.  Émile Durkheim is most often associated with structural functionalism, a macro-level theory that compares society to an organism in which each component of society attempts to maintain homeostasis (dynamic equilibrium)."
487,"""Suicide clusters"" are greater-than-average rates of suicide occurring within a short time frame.  After a well-publicized initial suicide, suicide rates tend to rise, particularly among teenagers and young adults.  This phenomenon can also be described as:",D,84,"A reference group is a comparison group.  Individuals compare their beliefs and behaviors to those of reference group members and often model the beliefs and behaviors of the reference group.   For example, after a well-publicized suicide, others who have already contemplated taking their life may consider modeling the behavior of the individual who committed suicide, notwithstanding that suicide occurs for multiple, complex reasons.
Therefore, ""suicide clusters"" (higher-than-average rates of suicide occurring within a short time frame) may occur as a result of imitation of a reference group (ie, individuals already contemplating suicide modeling the behavior of those who have recently committed suicide).
(Choice A)  Groupthink occurs when groups of individuals engage in dysfunctional, dangerous, or nonsensical behavior because a desire for group cohesion outweighs critical decision-making.  Groupthink explains the conscious decision-making practices that occur within a defined group, so it does not explain why suicide clusters happen.
(Choice B)  The mere exposure effect (or familiarity effect) argues that just the act of being exposed to something increases an individual's affinity for it.  For example, the more someone hears a song, the more they will like the song.  The mere exposure effect explains why people like certain things, but it cannot explain complex behavior like suicide.
(Choice C)  Mass hysteria (or group hysteria) occurs when fear and rumor spur similar behavior among many group members.  Examples of mass hysteria generally include physical symptoms (eg, twitching, laughing) that have no apparent cause and spread within an isolated community.  No examples are found of suicide caused by mass hysteria.
Educational objective:
Reference groups are groups to which individuals compare themselves.  Individuals are more likely to adjust their attitudes and behaviors to align with those of a reference group."
488,How would a proponent of Malthusian theory most likely interpret the data in Figure 1?,C,84,"The Malthusian theory of population growth suggests that the human population increases exponentially while resources increase at a slower rate.  According to this theory, the population growth rate can be slowed by preventative checks and positive checks.
Preventative checks are those that decrease the birth rate (and are typically voluntary, such as waiting to marry and having fewer children).  Positive checks increase the death rate, slowing population growth by shortening the average life span.  Positive checks can be small-scale (eg, increased death rate due to a flu virus) or large-scale (eg, an epidemic that wipes out half the population).  Large-scale positive checks, called Malthusian catastrophes (eg, widespread famine, disease epidemics, large-scale wars), dramatically reduce the population to a level that the available resources can easily sustain, by slowing or stopping population growth entirely.
(Choice A)  Increases in suicide rates, even up to the highest rates in Figure 1 (15-20 suicides per 100,000 people), will not have a large enough impact on the population to be considered a Malthusian catastrophe.
(Choice B)  According to Malthusian theory, the increased death rate (not the decreased suicide rate) during World War II would be considered a positive check, supporting the theory.
(Choice D)  A negative check does not exist in Malthusian theory, only positive checks and preventative checks.
Educational objective:
The Malthusian theory of population growth asserts that when the population grows faster than the resources necessary to sustain that population, preventative checks (reducing the birthrate) or positive checks (increasing the death rate) can slow down growth.  A Malthusian catastrophe is a large-scale positive check that slows or stops population growth."
489,Sociologists often consider suicide a deviant behavior because suicide:,D,84,"Deviance is any behavior that violates culturally established norms.  Deviant behavior can be viewed as simply odd or off-putting (eg, nose-picking in public) or can be viewed as egregious or criminal (eg, shooting someone).  Deviant behavior considered morally reprehensible by society is known as a taboo.  Suicide violates the major social script of protecting ourselves and trying to avoid pain, and is considered taboo in most societies.
Norms that dictate how to behave (also known as normative social scripts) exist in every culture and serve to disseminate information about appropriate conduct in a variety of situations.  Folkways are less formal social norms whereas mores are more formal social norms.  A violation of folkways (eg, walking outside with all your clothes on backward) is unlikely to draw more than a few raised eyebrows, but violation of mores (eg, walking outside naked) is likely to result in more formal punishment.
(Choice A)  Deviant behavior is not defined by how uncommon it is.
(Choice B)  Folkways are informal normative behaviors, practices, and traditions in society.
(Choice C)  Both formal and informal sanctions exist for attempting suicide.  Formal sanctions are those codified by law (eg, involuntary confinement for a suicide attempt), and informal sanctions are behaviors that occur at the individual level (eg, social shunning, disapproval).
Educational objective:
Deviance is the violation of culturally sanctioned normative behavior.  Deviant behavior that is morally reprehensible is considered a taboo."
490,The DSM-5 describes AN as characterized by a distorted body image and excessive food restriction leading to severe weight loss.  How would a behaviorist explain the behavior of an individual diagnosed with AN?,B,84,"Behaviorism is a theory in psychology that focuses on the role the environment plays in shaping human behavior.  Specifically, behaviorism focuses on how reinforcement and punishment shape human behavior.
Reinforcement is anything that increases the likelihood of the behavior happening again.  For example, positive attention for losing weight would reinforce that behavior and make it more likely the individual will lose more weight.  Punishment is anything that decreases the likelihood of a behavior happening again.  For example, if individuals are ridiculed for a behavior, they are less likely to engage in that behavior again.
Although positive attention for losing weight might initially reinforce the behaviors (eg, food restriction) associated with that weight loss, additional weight loss can become a self-reinforcing cycle in which an individual no longer needs external reinforcement and the weight loss itself is reinforcing.
(Choice A)  A behaviorist approach is more likely to be focused on the environmental factors influencing behavior whereas a biological approach is more likely to consider biochemical factors.
(Choice C)  A behaviorist might consider the role of idealized body types portrayed in the media and societal standards of beauty but would be more concerned with the direct reinforcements and punishments that shape individual behavior.
(Choice D)  A social learning theorist is more likely to suggest that individuals with AN have close friends or family members whose behavior they are imitating.  Social learning theory suggests that behavior is shaped through social interaction, imitation, and modeling, and can occur in the absence of direct reinforcement.
Educational objective:
Behaviorism focuses on how an individual's behavior is shaped by the environment, particularly through reinforcement and punishment.  Reinforcement tends to increase the likelihood of the behavior happening again whereas punishment decreases the likelihood of the behavior happening again."
491,Which is least applicable to a diagnosis of MD?,D,84,"The passage states that MD is currently classified under the umbrella of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and related disorders under body dysmorphic disorder.  OCD and related disorders are characterized by recurrent obsessions, which induce anxiety, and compulsions, which are used to relieve anxiety.
Obsessions are persistent, intrusive, and repetitive thoughts and urges (Choice A).  For example, obsessions for an individual with body dysmorphia might include persistent thoughts about being too small.  Compulsions are excessive, repetitive behaviors that reduce anxiety (Choices B and C).  The obsessions and compulsions are significantly time-consuming, interfering with a person's daily routine, social, or work functioning.  An individual with OCD or a related disorder may or may not realize that the obsessions and compulsions are excessive and unreasonable.
For example, a compulsion for an individual with body dysmorphia might include weightlifting at the gym for more than 4 hours a day.  This behavior (compulsive weightlifting) is meant to relieve the anxiety associated with repetitive thoughts about being too small.  MD involves an ""obsession with a larger and more muscular body.""  An obsession with losing weight is the least applicable to a diagnosis of MD.
Educational objective:
OCD and related disorders are characterized by obsessions (recurrent, persistent, unwelcome, intrusive, distressing thoughts or urges) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or mental acts meant to neutralize obsessions)."
492,"A proponent of the biopsychosocial approach to mental illness would likely consider which of the following as factors contributing to the development of an eating disorder?
Images seen on television and social media
Variations in hormones such as leptin and cortisol
Co-occurring mental illnesses",D,84,"Proponents of the biopsychosocial model of mental illness assert that mental illness results from the interaction between biological factors, psychological factors, and social factors.
Social factors that might influence the development of mental illness include the social and cultural context in which an individual lives as well as specific factors such as socioeconomic status, family dynamics, peer groups, and major life events.  Images portrayed in the media are social factors that could influence the development of an eating disorder.
Biological factors that might influence the development of mental illness include genetic predisposition, hormones, neurotransmitters, anatomy, and physiology.  Although potentially overlapping with other categories, certain environmental exposures to pathogens or toxins, physical trauma, and inadequate nutrition can also result in biological changes that make mental illness more likely.
Psychological factors that might influence the development of mental illness include personality characteristics (eg, self-efficacy, negative thought patterns) and co-occurring mental illnesses.
In contrast to the biopsychosocial approach to mental illness, the biomedical approach conceptualizes mental illness as directly resulting from chemical imbalances in the brain.  The biomedical perspective emphasizes the use of pharmacological therapy to correct these imbalances.
Educational objective:
The biopsychosocial model of mental illness suggests that mental illness is the result of interaction between biological factors, psychological factors, and social factors.  This differs from the biomedical model, which suggests that mental illness is caused by chemical imbalances in the brain."
493,Which of the following hypothetical findings from a follow-up study evaluating eating disorders in males is most consistent with the data presented in Table 1?,D,84,"Table 1 compares comorbid psychiatric diagnoses (ie, diagnoses that are present simultaneously in one individual) among groups of people diagnosed with eating disorders (AN, BN, and BED) and MD.
According to Table 1, 44% of the 36 cases that met diagnostic criteria for MD also met criteria for drug abuse/dependence, which exceeded the proportion of AN, BN, and BED cases that also met criteria for drug abuse/dependence.
Therefore, the hypothetical finding that individuals with MD were more likely to abuse anabolic steroids than those with any other of the studied disorders is most consistent with the data presented in Table 1.
(Choice A)  The study described in the passage was conducted using a sample of male veterans; therefore, conclusions about relative proportions of males and females diagnosed with eating disorders are not consistent with Table 1 data.
(Choice B)  Table 1 does not provide any information about individuals who may have met diagnostic criteria for more than one eating disorder; therefore, the finding that those with BED also met the criteria for BN within the past year is not consistent with Table 1 data.
(Choice C)  Table 1 suggests that individuals meeting criteria for BED were more likely to also meet criteria for depression (50%) than were those with AN (35%), which undermines the finding that individuals diagnosed with BED were less likely to also meet criteria for depression than individuals diagnosed with AN.
Educational objective:
To support findings from another study, data need not report exactly the same findings; rather, results from the first study should align with results from the second."
494,A physician suspects that a young woman seen in the clinic displays symptoms of an eating disorder.  Which of the following responses best demonstrates the ego defense mechanism of rationalization in the patient?,B,84,"According to psychoanalytic theory, ego defense mechanisms are an unconscious way to deal with the anxiety caused by unacceptable urges and thoughts.  Ego defense mechanisms were first proposed by Sigmund Freud (considered the father of psychoanalytic theory) and later expanded on by other psychoanalytic theorists.  There are many defense mechanisms; denial, repression, rationalization, projection, and sublimation are five common mechanisms.
Rationalization occurs when an individual unconsciously generates an acceptable excuse for an unacceptable behavior or thought.  For example, skipping meals is not normal or acceptable behavior; the patient using this defense mechanism is rationalizing the behavior by telling herself that she will eat a lot later on.
(Choice A)  Sublimation involves turning unacceptable thoughts or behaviors into productive, acceptable ones.  An individual who writes in a journal when feeling the urge to binge and purge is using this ego defense mechanism.
(Choice C)  Repression involves an inability to consciously recall unacceptable thoughts or behaviors.  An individual who is unable to remember engaging in binging behaviors is using this ego defense mechanism.
(Choice D)  Projection involves the attribution of one's own unacceptable thoughts and behaviors to another person or group.  Individuals who focus on the real or imagined unacceptable behaviors of others instead of their own behaviors may be using this ego defense mechanism.
Educational objective:
Psychoanalytic theory suggests that ego defense mechanisms are a method of dealing with unacceptable thoughts and behaviors that cause anxiety.  Rationalization is an ego defense mechanism in which an individual generates an acceptable excuse for an unacceptable behavior or thought."
495,The most appropriate control subjects for the study described in the final paragraph would be:,A,84,"Control subjects provide a comparison group in experiments.  The control subjects should be as similar as possible to the subjects of interest, except for the causal (independent) variable being studied.  For example, in clinical trials controls are demographically similar to the treatment subjects (or those under evaluation) but do not receive any active medication or treatment.
This study sought to determine whether a previous diagnosis of an eating disorder would predict other comorbid psychological disorders.  The most appropriate control subjects should be similar to other subjects except with regard to the variable being studied.  Therefore, the most appropriate control subjects for the study described in the passage are males who have never been diagnosed with an eating disorder.
(Choice B)  If the study described in the passage was looking at the rates of psychiatric comorbidity for males who had and had not received treatment for their eating disorder, then males who had never been treated for an eating disorder would be a good comparison group.
(Choices C and D)  Control subjects should be as similar to treatment subjects or the observational subjects of interest as possible.  Comparing males with eating disorders to females who have never been diagnosed with or treated for an eating disorder would not be an effective comparison because two significant variables (sex and diagnosis/treatment) differ between the groups.
Educational objective:
Control subjects provide a useful comparison to the subjects of interest in a study.  Control subjects should be as similar to the treatment subjects as possible, except for the variable of interest."
496,Which of the following study procedures described in the passage is most likely measuring or attempting to evoke the affective component of attitude?,A,84,"The term attitude refers to a person's evaluation or disposition toward something (eg, a person, an object, an event).  Attitudes can be positive, negative, or neutral and can change over time.  Psychologists have identified three components of attitudes:
The affective component relates to how a person feels about something, including positive or negative evaluations or emotions (eg, anger, excitement).  For example, a person might have strong negative feelings about a political candidate, causing her to favor that candidate's opponent.
The cognitive component relates to a person's beliefs and opinions about something.  For example, a person might believe that a particular candidate has characteristics or experiences that make that candidate well suited to hold office.
The behavioral component relates to how a person acts toward something.  In the above examples, voting for or against a candidate reflects the behavioral component of attitude.
The study procedure requiring the fantasy/reality contrast condition and the positive fantasy condition to fantasize about the positive aspects of losing weight is most likely attempting to evoke the affective component of attitude because positive fantasies will likely generate positive emotions in the participants.
(Choice B)  Even though reflecting on past failed weight loss attempts would likely evoke the affective component of attitude, participants were never asked to do this as part of the study procedure.
(Choice C)  Rating success on a scale of 1 to 7 evokes the cognitive aspect of attitude by forcing the participant to think about a future event.  No affect is involved in this task.
(Choice D)  Participating in proactive weight loss strategies would be most associated with the behavioral (not affective) component of attitude.
Educational objective:
Psychologists outline three components of attitude:  affective (feelings), cognitive (thoughts, beliefs, opinions), and behavioral (actions).  Attitudes can be positive, negative, or neutral and can change over time."
497,The study design described in the passage is most aligned with which theory of motivation?,B,84,"The expectancy theory of motivation proposes that individuals are motivated to act based on the expected outcomes of their behavior.  According to this theory, motivation involves expectancy, instrumentality, and valence:
Expectancy is the belief that one will be able to achieve the desired outcome.  Asking participants to rate how successful they think they will be at losing weight is a measure of expectancy.
Instrumentality is the belief that one has control over the desired outcome.  Asking participants to rate how much control they believe they have over their success is a measure of instrumentality.
Valence involves the value placed on the desired outcome.  If the researchers also asked participants to rate how much they wanted to lose weight, this would be a measure of valence.
(Choice A)  The arousal theory of motivation suggests that individuals are motivated to maintain an optimum level of arousal.  When underaroused, people seek activities to increase stimulation (eg, if bored at home, one will go out dancing).  When overaroused, people seek to decrease stimulation (eg, if overwhelmed at a party, one will step outside for quiet).
(Choice C)  The incentive theory of motivation suggests that individuals are motivated according to external rewards.  Therefore, people engage in the behavior that results in the most desirable outcomes.  For example, people are motivated to go to work to make money.
(Choice D)  The humanistic theory of motivation suggests that, assuming more basic needs (like hunger) have been met, individuals are ultimately motivated to seek self-actualization, the ultimate fulfillment of their own potential.  The motivation to pursue a medical degree is an example of wanting to fulfill one's potential.
Educational objective:
The expectancy theory of motivation proposes that motivation results from expectancy (believing one is capable of achieving an outcome), instrumentality (believing one has control over the outcome), and valence (believing the outcome is desirable)."
498,According to the Maslow hierarchy of needs:,B,84,"In the Maslow hierarchy of needs, the desire to lose weight to look and feel healthy and accomplished is an example of an esteem need, a psychological need that can be met after basic needs are satisfied.  Maslow proposed that humans are motivated to achieve certain needs, which are arranged in a hierarchy of importance:  basic needs must be met before psychological needs can be addressed, and psychological needs must be met before self-fulfillment needs can be addressed.
Basic needs include physiological needs and safety needs.  Physiological needs are the basic elements necessary for survival, such as sleep, water, food, and air.  Safety needs involve protection from danger, a sense of security, law and order, and freedom from fear.
Psychological needs include love/belonging needs and esteem needs.  Love/belonging needs include the need for connection with friends, family, and romantic partners with regard to affection, trust, and acceptance; they also involve the need to feel integrated into a group, society, or culture.  Esteem needs involve the desire to feel accomplished and productive within a society.  These involve the need for feelings of achievement, independence, and respect.
Self-actualization needs involve a desire to seek personal experiences that allow one to reach full potential.  Although Maslow believed that every person was capable of attaining self-actualization, he held that progress toward self-actualization would be thwarted by failure to attain lower needs.
(Choice A)  According to Maslow's theory, physiological needs are at the bottom of the pyramid and must be fulfilled before any other needs.  Therefore, successful weight loss is not required before physiological needs can be met.
(Choice C)  A desire to eat food, however unhealthy, most closely corresponds to a physiological need.  The desire for love and belonging, as conceptualized by Maslow, pertains to intimate human interactions.
(Choice D)  Losing weight to improve health is a basic, physiological need, whereas losing weight for social acceptance is a higher, psychological need.
Educational objective:
The Maslow hierarchy of needs proposes that basic needs (physiological and safety) must be met before psychological needs (love and belonging, esteem) can be attained.  All lower needs must be addressed before one can reach the pinnacle of the hierarchy:  self-actualization."
499,Which of the following proactive weight loss strategies is most consistent with drive-reduction theory?,D,84,"Drive-reduction theory proposes that motivation is a result of a disruption of homeostasis, which generates a biological need.  The biological need generates a drive to fulfill that need, which prompts action.  For example, when blood glucose levels drop, an organism feels hungry and engages in food-seeking behaviors.  Therefore, eating slowly and mindfully and stopping when full is a strategy that addresses a physiological need and is most consistent with drive-reduction theory.
(Choice A)  Keeping a food journal does not directly address the reduction of a physiological drive.
(Choice B)  Secondary reinforcers (eg, new clothes) do not address the reduction of a drive; this strategy more closely aligns with incentive theory.
(Choice C)  Exercise disrupts homeostasis.  Although this disruption is positive and leads to healthy physiological adaptations, this strategy is the opposite of drive-reduction theory.
Educational objective:
According to drive-reduction theory, motivation is the result of a disruption in homeostasis, which produces a physiological need (eg, hunger), which leads to a drive (eg, desire to eat).  Homeostasis is reestablished once the drive is reduced."
500,"If the study researchers concluded that their hypothesis was correct, which of the following was most likely their hypothesis?",A,84,"Figure 2 shows the correlation between weight loss and the initial expectation of success scores of participants in each group.  In all groups, individuals with lower expectation of success scores lost less weight, and those with higher expectation of success scores lost more weight.  Therefore, expectation of success was positively correlated with weight loss, or, as expectation of success scores increased, so did the amount of weight loss.
Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) indicates the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.  The closer r is to −1 or 1 (ie, an absolute value of 1), the stronger the correlation.  Positive r -values reflect a positive correlation between variables (as one variable increases, so does the other) and negative r -values indicate a negative correlation between variables (as one variable increases, the other decreases).
(Choice B)  The negative reality group lost weight over time (negative thinking was associated with successful weight loss); therefore, negative thinking does not appear to be negatively correlated with weight loss.
(Choices C and D)  Figure 1 shows that each group had a similar difference between the average starting weight and average ending weight, suggesting little difference in weight loss success among the groups.  The positive fantasy group appeared to have lost approximately the same amount of weight as the other two groups, although the strength of the correlation between success scores and weight loss is the weakest, reflected in the correlation coefficient that has the lowest absolute value.
Educational objective:
A correlation coefficient (r-value) with an absolute value close to 1 indicates a strong linear relationship between variables.  Positive correlations reflect scores that move in the same direction (both increase; both decrease), while negative correlations reflect scores that move in opposite directions (one increases while the other decreases)."
501,Which of the following participants are most likely to experience learned helplessness?,D,84,"Learned helplessness describes feelings of extreme powerlessness along with a perceived lack of control, often resulting from a series of failures or trauma.  When an individual starts to feel that his efforts are futile and stops trying altogether, learned helplessness has occurred.  Learned helplessness has been associated with an external locus of control and low self-efficacy.
Locus of control is defined by whether an individual believes her actions will impact the outcome of a situation.  An individual with an internal locus of control feels that she has power to influence the outcome; an individual with an external locus of control feels that the outcome is due to luck or fate, which she cannot influence.
Self-efficacy describes a person's beliefs about his own competence or ability at a certain task.  Self-efficacy can vary from task to task.  For example, someone with high self-efficacy for math may have low self-efficacy for playing soccer.  Self-efficacy can also change over time.  For example, after attending a soccer camp, the individual's self-efficacy for soccer may be high.
The expectation of success score reflects self-efficacy, whereas the control of success score reflects locus of control. Those who selected ""not successful"" (low self-efficacy for weight loss) and ""no control"" (external locus of control for weight loss) are the most likely to experience learned helplessness (Choices A, B, and C).
Educational objective:
Learned helplessness describes feelings of powerlessness and loss of control, often occurring after a series of failures or trauma.  Learned helplessness is tied to low self-efficacy (personal beliefs about one's abilities) and an external locus of control (personal beliefs about whether one can influence the outcome of a situation)."
502,Which of the following statements is a situational attribution that is consistent with the information in the passage?,B,84,"Individuals in residentially segregated, low-income neighborhoods (ie, high-poverty neighborhoods) are subjected to spatial inequality: exposure to higher rates of crime, violence, pollution, and other environmental health risks that negatively impact their health.
To explain behavior (our own or that of others) we make attributions, which are dispositional/personal (ie, based on internal characteristics such as motivation) or situational/environmental (ie, based on external factors such as the neighborhood in which one grew up).
The statement that individuals from low-income neighborhoods drop out of school due to environmental stressors is a situational attribution (ie, based on an external factor) consistent with the concentration of poverty in certain neighborhoods (Paragraph 2) and the association between poverty and lower graduation rates (Paragraph 4).
(Choice A)  The statement that individuals remain impoverished because they lack motivation is a dispositional/personal attribution that blames poverty on characteristics of the individual.
(Choice C)  The statement that individuals who break the cycle of poverty are more resilient than those who remain impoverished is a dispositional/personal attribution that implies that if one is resilient enough (ie, a personal quality) the cycle of poverty can be broken.
(Choice D)  The passage does not compare the health of individuals just above and below the poverty threshold.  Furthermore, incremental increases in social strata correspond to incremental increases in health (socioeconomic gradient in health), so people just above the poverty threshold are only marginally healthier than those just below it.
Educational objective:
Residentially segregated, low-income neighborhoods have more crime, violence, pollution, and other environmental health risk factors (spatial inequality).  Attributions are explanations for behavior and can be dispositional/personal (ie, based on internal characteristics) or situational/environmental (ie, based on external factors)."
503,The third paragraph most directly describes the relationship between poverty and:,B,84,"Social exclusion
Inability to participate:
Economically (ie, as an income earner or consumer)
Socially (ie, limited/no interaction with others in society)
Civically (ie, community and political involvement)
Social exclusion occurs when individuals are marginalized to the point of being unable to participate in society economically (eg, earning money, purchasing goods/services), socially (eg, interacting with others), and civically (eg, voting).  Social exclusion is tied to many circumstances that are stigmatized in society (eg, mental illness, poverty), although it is unclear whether social exclusion is a cause or a result of such factors.
The third paragraph, which states that poverty prevents or limits access to productive social activities, such as working, buying goods and services, community and political involvement, and engagement with social networks, most directly describes the relationship between poverty and social exclusion.
(Choice A)  Social control is the exertion of influence by a group (eg, family, society as a whole) to ensure that the behavior of individuals conforms to that of the group.  The third paragraph does not describe the relationship between poverty and social control.
(Choice C)  False consciousness refers to individuals from lower classes adopting the misleading views of the upper class and therefore accepting the status quo (eg, injustice, exploitation).  The third paragraph does not describe the relationship between poverty and false consciousness.
(Choice D)  McDonaldization describes the process by which extreme efficiency and rationalization produce negative consequences in society (eg, reduced quality of products).  The third paragraph does not describe the relationship between poverty and McDonaldization.
Educational objective:
Social exclusion is the marginalization of individuals so that they are unable to participate in society economically (through earning or spending money), socially (through interaction with others), or civically (through political or other community engagement)."
504,The conclusion drawn from the longitudinal study described in the final paragraph would be best supported by a follow-up study that found a:,A,84,"Social reproduction refers to the fact that successive generations tend to occupy the same social class (eg, children born into lower social class families tend to occupy a lower social class as adults).  Social reproduction occurs because social structures (eg, tax laws) maintain and perpetuate social inequality over time.
The conclusion by the longitudinal study that the social reproduction of poverty occurs because lower-income parents lack economic resources (ie, economic capital), social connections (ie, social capital), and knowledge about the education system (ie, cultural capital) would best be supported by a follow-up study demonstrating a positive correlation between children's educational attainment and their parents' cultural capital.
(Choice B)  A positive correlation between parent's educational attainment and their desire to help their children succeed undermines the longitudinal study's conclusion that there was no difference in terms of parents wanting to help their children succeed.
(Choice C)  A negative correlation between children's future earnings and their parents' economic capital (ie, children from low-income families grow up to earn a high income) undermines social reproduction and does not support the longitudinal study's conclusion.
(Choice D)  A negative correlation between children's future earnings and their parents' desire to help their children succeed (ie, children who earn a high income as adults had parents who had little desire to help them succeed) undermines the longitudinal study's conclusion that there was no difference in terms of parents wanting to help their children succeed.
Educational objective:
Social reproduction occurs when social class remains unchanged from one generation to the next (eg, children born into a lower social class tend to occupy a lower social class as adults)."
505,The experts' suggestion about the education system in the final paragraph draws most directly from which of the following sociological concepts?,D,84,"Educational stratification refers to the mechanisms that produce inequality in educational access (eg, schools available to students) and outcomes (eg, graduation rates, college matriculation) in society.  Students are stratified in the education system as a result of social characteristics, such as parent's income or influence.
Educational stratification occurs on multiple levels.  For instance, students with high social standing (eg, wealth) have many options (eg, well-funded local public schools, private schools), whereas students with low social standing have fewer options (ie, limited access to quality schools and teachers).
The experts' suggestion in the final paragraph that the education system perpetuates income disparities through the unequal distribution of resources (ie, funding, quality teachers) draws most directly from the concept of educational stratification.
(Choice A)  Stereotype threat occurs when members of a group are made aware of a negative stereotype about their group before engaging in an activity, causing performance to suffer.  The experts' suggestion about the education system does not reflect stereotype threat.
(Choice B)  Formal curriculum includes the explicit, official content taught to students in the educational system, whereas the hidden curriculum promotes certain values and behaviors implicitly.  The stratification of the educational system is an aspect of the hidden (not formal) curriculum.
(Choice C)  Teacher expectancy occurs when a teacher's beliefs about a student result in the student meeting the teacher's expectations and is thought to occur as a result of the teacher's behavior toward the student.  The experts' suggestion about the education system does not reflect teacher expectancy.
Educational objective:
Educational stratification refers to the social mechanisms that produce inequality in educational access (eg, school options) and outcomes (eg, graduation rates)."
506,"To produce an aggregate measure of social stratification (Paragraph 1), a researcher would be most likely to assess which of the following factors?",C,84,"Social stratification
Social class
Economic assets (eg, income, property)
Social status
Prestige (ie, favorable reputation) among others in society
Power
Ability to exert control over the actions of others
Social stratification is the hierarchical organization of individuals in society based on social class, social status, and power:
Social class is largely determined by economic resources (eg, income, property).  Wealthy individuals are at the top of the social hierarchy, whereas those in the working and lower classes are at the bottom.
Social status refers to one's prestige (reputation).  Certain careers (eg, physician), personal characteristics (eg, attractiveness), and achievements (eg, winning an Olympic gold medal) confer status that is not necessarily tied to wealth (although it can be).
Power is the ability to control others.  Certain careers (eg, politician) and accomplishments (eg, a large social media following) increase one's power.
Therefore, in order to produce an aggregate measure of social stratification, a researcher would be most likely to assess social class, social status, and power.
(Choice A)  Although one's power and property (ie, an indicator of social class) are important measures of social stratification, charismatic authority results from extraordinary claims or personal appeal (eg, leaders are seen as legitimate because they are inspiring).  Power, charismatic authority, and property would not provide the best aggregate measure of social stratification.
(Choice B)  Social role (expected behavior in social situations), social capital (the advantageous ties in one's social network), and social networks (nonhierarchical webs of interaction between people) would not provide the best aggregate measure of social stratification.
(Choice D)  Although one's social class is an important measure of social stratification, social role (expected behavior in social situations) and social identity (how ideas about oneself are shaped by group membership) are not useful for an aggregate measure of social stratification.
Educational objective:
Social stratification is the hierarchical organization of individuals in society based on their social class (eg, income), social status (eg, prestige), and power (ie, influence over others)."
507,Does the passage provide a threshold for absolute poverty?,B,84,"Absolute poverty is the inability to secure the basic necessities of life, such as food, clean water, and shelter.  Relative poverty, which is defined in comparison to the economic conditions of others, is a more subjective measure encompassing quality-of-life issues, such as relatively longer travel times to reach medical care using public transportation because one cannot afford a car.
The first paragraph describes poverty thresholds defined as 50% of the median household income in a given country, which is a measure of relative (not absolute) poverty.
(Choice A)  Absolute poverty has a relatively standardized definition: the inability to meet the basic necessities of life, regardless of where one lives.  Relative poverty is based on the economic standards of others, so it is less standardized and more dependent on the economic circumstances of others.
(Choice C)  The first paragraph describes the poverty threshold as 50% of the median household income in a given country (relative poverty), not as the threshold below which individuals are unable to meet their basic needs (absolute poverty).
(Choice D)  Although the threshold described in the first paragraph is a global standard that can be applied to any given country, it is the standard for relative poverty, not absolute poverty.
Educational objective:
Absolute poverty is the inability to secure basic life necessities (eg, food, shelter).  Relative poverty, defined in comparison to the economic conditions of others, is the inability to meet the standards of the society in which one lives (eg, inability to afford a car if most others in society have a car)."

Sociologists conceptualize society as being stratified, or comprised of hierarchical categories known as social classes.  The three major social classes are the upper class, middle class, and lower class.  Several factors contribute to a person's social class, including the social class of one's parents, educational attainment, and income/occupation.  Social class impacts life outcomes:  upper classes have the most privilege (eg, access to the best schools, health care, jobs) and power (ability to influence or control others).
The investigators would most likely conclude that resilience is positively correlated with social class in adulthood because despite similar circumstances, Michael (high resilience) advanced to a middle-class lifestyle whereas Jake (low resilience) remained in the lower class.  When variables are positively correlated, increases in one variable (resilience) are associated with increases in the other (social class).
(Choice B)  Social reproduction refers to the fact that successive generations tend to occupy the same social class.  In other words, children born into lower-class families tend to remain lower class as adults.  Michael's trajectory defies social reproduction as he advanced his social class.  Therefore, social reproduction appears to be negatively correlated with resilience (as resilience increases, social reproduction is less likely).
(Choice C)  Social privilege is a theory that certain advantages are available only to certain people in society.  For example, higher education is considered a social privilege for middle- and upper-class children.  Jake and Michael grew up with similar underprivileged childhoods but demonstrated very different outcomes, so it is not possible to determine whether social privilege is correlated with resilience.
(Choice D)  Social stratification is the categorization of people within a society into hierarchical social classes.  Michael advances social strata (level in the hierarchy) while Jake does not.  Therefore, social stratum in adulthood appears to be positively correlated with resilience (as resilience increases, people advance in social strata).
Educational objective:
There are three generally recognized social classes (categories of people based on wealth, occupation, and status) in the United States—the upper, middle, and lower classes.  Those in the upper class tend to have the most power and prestige in society.  This hierarchical categorization is known as social stratification."
509,Michael and his wife share what type of kinship?,A,84,"Types of kinship
Consanguineal
Based on genetic relationship (eg, biological parents)
Affinal
Based on marriage (eg, spouses)
Fictive
Social ties that are not consanguineal or affinal (eg, adopted children)
Degrees of kinship
Primary
First-degree family members (eg, mother)
Secondary
Primary kin of first-degree family members (eg, mother’s brother)
Tertiary
Secondary kin of first-degree family members (eg, mother’s uncle)
In sociology, kinship describes how individuals in society are related to one another, including connections through birth, marriage, adoption, or other socially defined relationships (eg, godparents, fraternity brothers).
There are three major types of kinship: consanguineal (genetically related individuals), affinal (individuals related through marriage), and fictive, which describes individuals related through something other than genetics or marriage.  Also known as chosen kin or voluntary kin, fictive kin may share bonds through law (eg, adopted children), religion (eg, godparents), close family friendships, and other such means.
Kinship is also defined by degree of relatedness.  The nuclear family is considered the basic social unit or grouping in society and is defined as two coupled (usually married) adults and their offspring.  Primary kin are nuclear family members sharing one of three possible relationships:  spouses, parent/child, siblings.  Secondary kin are one degree removed from the nuclear family (eg, grandparent, aunt, brother-in-law).  Tertiary kin are two degrees removed from the nuclear family (eg, cousin, brother-in-law's mother).
(Choice B)  Michael's relationships to his son and mother (not his wife) are examples of consanguineal kinship.
(Choice C)  Michael's relationship to his adopted daughter is an example of fictive kinship.
(Choice D)  Michael's relationship to his wife is a primary, not a secondary, form of kinship.
Educational objective:
Kinship describes how individuals in society are related.  Consanguineal kin are related by blood, affinal kin are related by marriage, and fictive kin are related by other means (adoption, religion).  The nuclear family (two married adults and their offspring) is the basic social unit composed of primary kin.  Secondary kin are one degree removed from the nuclear family (eg, uncle) and tertiary kin are two degrees removed (eg, uncle's wife)."
510,The type of environment in which Jake and Michael grew up is most directly defined by:,D,84,"Spatial inequality results from the uneven distribution of wealth and resources across a geographic area.  Some of the best examples of spatial inequality are low-income subsidized housing projects (where Jake and Michael grew up) because these typically concentrate large numbers of lower-income individuals into one area that is geographically separated or isolated from middle- and upper-income areas.
The physical separation of groups by social characteristics such as race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status is known as residential segregation.  Segregated neighborhoods experience different degrees of environmental benefits (access to safe parks and good schools) and environmental burdens (crime, pollution); this is known as environmental injustice.  Spatial inequality results in the worst health outcomes for residents in the poorest neighborhoods because of increased exposure to violence and environmental risks.
(Choice A)  Gentrification occurs when higher-income residents begin to move into lower-income urban areas, resulting in renovation and increased property values that displace the original lower-income residents.  Although the neighborhood where Jake and Michael grew up is a poor, high-crime area, there is no evidence of the urban renewal necessary for gentrification.
(Choice B)  Absolute poverty is the inability to secure the basic necessities of life, such as food and shelter.  Relative poverty is subjectively defined in comparison to the economic conditions of others.  Living in a high-crime public housing project reflects poverty that is relative to others in the same urban area with nicer living conditions.
(Choice C)  Institutional discrimination is the unfair treatment of some people, typically lower-income individuals or members of minority groups, by social structures (eg, laws, education system).  If law enforcement arrests more minority men than white men, this would constitute institutional discrimination.  Spatial inequality, while related to institutional discrimination, more directly describes the type of environment in which Jake and Michael grew up.
Educational objective:
Spatial inequality is the unfair distribution of wealth and resources across a geographic area.  Spatial inequality includes residential segregation, the physical separation of groups by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, and environmental injustice, increased crime and pollution in lower-income neighborhoods.  Spatial inequality results in poor health outcomes for lower-income individuals."
511,Which of the following supports the study's primary finding in explaining why Michael has experienced fewer health problems than Jake?,B,84,"Types of social support
Emotional
Love, affection, intimacy
Esteem
Encouragement, confidence
Tangible
Money, resources, food, a place to sleep when needed
Informational
Advice, information
Companionship
Mere presence, sharing in an activity
Social support refers to the people who provide a network of love, help, and resources throughout one's lifetime.  Social support can be provided by family, friends, coworkers, coaches, religious and social organizations, online networks, and even pets.  Social support fulfills emotional (eg, physical intimacy), esteem (eg, encouragement), tangible (eg, a place to live), informational (eg, advice) and companionship (eg, activity partners) needs.
Studies suggest that individuals with strong social support networks tend to have better health, possibly because social support lessens the impact of stress (but the exact mechanism is unclear).  The study's primary finding is that high-resilience men had received more social support outside their immediate families while growing up than did low-resilience men.  The fact that Michael has experienced fewer health problems than Jake can be best explained by his close relationship with his pastor, who helped him handle stress productively while he was growing up.
(Choice A)  Michael's wife convincing him to quit smoking and to see his doctor regularly is an example of social support provided by immediate family while he is an adult.  The results suggest that social support provided by individuals outside the immediate family while growing up was critical for high-resilience men in the study.
(Choice C)  Although Jake's lack of health insurance as an adult does help to explain his poorer health, it is not an explanation based on the primary finding that low-resilience men lacked social support while growing up.
(Choice D)  The results do suggest that low-resilience men are more anxious, disagreeable, and pessimistic, traits that describe neuroticism, which is correlated with anxiety and depression.  However, this explanation is not based on the primary finding that low-resilience men lacked social support while growing up.
Educational objective:
Social support refers to the social network of relationships that provide assistance, resources, and intimacy.  Social support fulfills emotional, esteem, tangible, informational, and companionship needs.  People with strong social support networks tend to experience better health than those with weak social support."

This study defines resilience as the ability to prevail despite threats to adequate psychosocial development.  Therefore, this study appears to be basing human development on Erik Erikson's psychosocial theory.
There are many different theories focusing on various aspects of human development.  Psychoanalytic theories, like those of Freud and Erikson, focus on personality development.  Erikson's theory focuses on how personality is shaped by social interaction throughout a lifetime.
(Choice A)  Cognitive theories of human development attempt to describe how learning and mental processes progress.  Piaget's theory contends that children progress through four universal stages that reflect the acquisition of predictable mental skills.  This study does not assess human cognitive development.
(Choice B)  Freud's theory proposes that progression through psychosexual stages as a child determines adult personality.  This study assessed the ability to prevail in the face of threats to adequate psychosocial (not psychosexual) development.
(Choice D)  Lawrence Kohlberg's theory of moral development proposes that humans progress through stages of moral and ethical reasoning throughout their lifetime, starting with basic moral reasoning during childhood and progressing to more abstract reasoning in adulthood.  Moral reasoning development is not assessed in this study.
Educational objective:
Theories of human development focus on personality, cognition, and morality.  Psychoanalytic theories describe personality development in terms of childhood conflicts (Freud) or a series of lifetime crises (Erikson).  Cognitive theories attempt to describe the importance of nurture (Vygotsky) versus nature (Piaget) in the development of thinking.  Moral development theories (Kohlberg) attempt to define the progression of moral reasoning throughout a lifetime."

This reasoning is LEAST consistent with which concept?",A,84,"A self-fulfilling prophecy occurs when a belief about oneself (eg, ""I'm a terrible test taker"") causes behavior that makes the belief come true (eg, belief causes test anxiety, resulting in actual poor performance).  In other words, the belief itself, regardless of if the belief is true or justified, directly or indirectly initiates a chain of events that prove the belief true.  Michael's comments about Jake are not consistent with a self-fulfilling prophecy.
(Choices B, C, and D)  Attributional biases are cognitive biases (irrational thought processes) that occur when individuals attempt to understand their own behavior or the behavior of others.  Common errors are often made when individuals attribute their own behavior (or the behavior of others) to some cause, including:
Just world phenomenon
Fundamental attribution error
Self-serving bias
The just world phenomenon is an attributional bias that occurs when one believes that the world is fair and good things happen to people who are hard-working and good and that bad things happen to people who are bad or lazy.  Michael's attributing Jake's failure to being ""a bad person"" and his own success to having taken advantage of opportunities is an example of the just world phenomenon (Choice B).
The self-serving bias is an attributional bias that occurs when people attribute their success to themselves (I earned it because I worked hard) but blame their failure on external circumstances (I failed because the teacher hates me).  Michael's attributing his success to his own hard work is an example of the self-serving bias (Choice C).
The fundamental attribution error is an attributional bias that occurs when one attributes another's behavior to internal factors, such as personality, instead of external or situational factors.  Michael's attributing Jake's outcome to his personality (""He was always just a bad person"") exemplifies the fundamental attribution error (Choice D).
Educational objective:
When attempting to understand behavior, people often make attributional biases.  The just world phenomenon occurs when one believes that bad things happen only to bad people.  The fundamental attribution error occurs when people attribute the behavior of others to their personality rather than external factors.  The self-serving bias occurs when one attributes one's own success to internal (instead of external) factors."
514,"Based on the passage, the control subjects in Study 2 could also develop which additional conditioned response?",B,84,"In classical conditioning, a previously neutral stimulus causes an organism to react in a manner similar to the reaction to a natural or unconditioned stimulus after the two stimuli have been paired.  Unconditioned stimuli (eg, meat) are biologically arousing, causing an innate (untrained) reaction called an unconditioned response (eg, salivation).  Neutral stimuli (eg, bell) do not produce a meaningful response.  After being paired with the unconditioned stimulus, the previously neutral stimulus, now termed the conditioned stimulus, causes the organism to react with a learned, or conditioned response (eg, salivation in response to a bell).  The conditioned response is typically similar to the unconditioned response.
For patients receiving chemotherapy, the room, apparatus, smells, and other characteristics of the context (neutral stimuli) could become associated with the experience of nausea because it is in this environment that the cytotoxic medication (unconditioned stimulus) caused the nausea (unconditioned response).  After learning, those contextual characteristics of the room (conditioned stimulus) will provoke AN (conditioned response) before the cytotoxic medication is administered.  Similarly, a patient could develop the additional conditioned response of feeling fatigue when entering the chemotherapy room.
(Choices A and D)  Unconditioned responses occur naturally (or biologically) as a result of unconditioned stimuli; they are not learned.  Hair loss follows chemotherapy medication because it destroys the hair follicle cells, and nausea naturally results from motion sickness.
(Choice C)  Control subjects in Study 2 received only water, so they would not develop a conditioned response (ie, difficulty concentrating) in association with novel-flavored beverages.
Educational objective:
Unconditioned responses occur naturally, without learning (eg, nausea in response to cytotoxic medication).  Conditioned responses occur when a neutral stimulus (eg, chemotherapy equipment) is paired with an unconditioned stimulus (eg, cytotoxic medication)."
515,"Which of the following is NOT accurate regarding antiemetic medications, which are administered to patients undergoing chemotherapy to treat or prevent N/V?",A,84,"N/V is an aversive stimulus.  Antiemetic medications can be administered while patients are experiencing N/V to treat their N/V, or before chemotherapy to prevent N/V entirely.  Either scenario may result in operant conditioning, in which the likelihood of an individual repeating a behavior is influenced by the outcome of that behavior (ie, by reward or punishment).
Behavior is increased or maintained by reinforcement; positive reinforcement occurs when a desirable stimulus is applied, encouraging a behavior to happen again.  For example, a young child receives a lollipop (desirable stimulus) for good behavior during a medical appointment, which increases the likelihood of future good behavior.
In terms of the answer choice that is not accurate regarding antiemetic medications, an antiemetic that prevents a recurrence of N/V is inhibiting an undesirable stimulus, not adding a desirable stimulus; therefore, it is not an example of positive reinforcement.
(Choice B)  Negative reinforcement occurs when an undesirable stimulus is withdrawn, which encourages a behavior to happen again.  For example, taking an antiemetic to treat (remove) current PN (unpleasant stimulus) increases the likelihood of the individual taking the medication in the future, which is negative reinforcement.
(Choice C)  Escape learning occurs when an individual learns how to terminate a current unpleasant stimulus.  For example, an antiemetic that treats current PN may produce escape learning, as the individual learns that taking the medication stops N/V (unpleasant stimulus).
(Choice D)  Avoidance learning occurs when an individual figures out how to prevent experiencing the unpleasant stimulus in the future.  For example, taking an antiemetic before chemotherapy, thereby preventing a recurrence of N/V (unpleasant stimulus), is an example of avoidance learning.
Educational objective:
In operant conditioning, the outcome of a behavior impacts the likelihood that the behavior will be repeated; behavior increases due to reinforcement, and it decreases due to punishment.  Positive reinforcement refers to a desirable stimulus being applied, whereas negative reinforcement is an undesirable stimulus being withdrawn."
516,"Based on the passage and the principles of taste aversion, which strategy should physicians suggest to their patients undergoing chemotherapy?  On the day of chemotherapy, patients should:",D,84,"A conditioned taste aversion is a specific and powerful type of classical conditioning that occurs when an organism becomes ill after consuming something (eg, food, alcohol).  Whatever was consumed prior to the N/V can become associated with the illness (even if it did not cause the illness) and is avoided afterward, long term.  Taste aversions almost always link illness with foods (or smells), which is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation.
Of the given choices, a physician should suggest that patients avoid eating their favorite foods on the day of chemotherapy.  This strategy will prevent patients from developing a taste aversion to these foods.  If a favored food is consumed prior to the experience of nausea (resulting from chemotherapy), it is possible that the food will be permanently associated with the nausea.
(Choice A)  Although there is a chance that a salient, novel-flavored beverage could overshadow the favorite food and become linked to the nausea, there is nothing in the passage that suggests it would prevent a taste aversion if paired with a favorite food.
(Choice B)  Taste aversions can develop even with hours passing between food consumption and becoming ill.  Consuming a favorite food hours before chemotherapy would not prevent the development of a taste aversion.
(Choice C)  Patients could develop a taste aversion to their favorite beverages if consumed prior to becoming ill.
Educational objective:
Taste aversion is a specific and powerful type of classical conditioning that occurs after just one instance of becoming ill following food/beverage consumption.  Taste aversions are long lasting and can develop despite many hours passing between consumption and illness."
517,"In a follow-up to Study 2, the control participants returned to the chemotherapy room to fill out surveys every day for a week after their final chemotherapy treatment.  By the end of the week, participants' AN had significantly decreased.  This illustrates which phenomenon?",C,84,"In classical conditioning, the strength of the conditioned response tends to follow a pattern over time.
Extinction occurs when a conditioned response gradually stops occurring in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus.  For example, a dog that has been conditioned to salivate (conditioned response) in response to the sound of a bell (conditioned stimulus) will gradually stop salivating to the sound of the bell if that sound is repeatedly presented without food.
If the control participants repeatedly return to the chemotherapy room to fill out surveys, they would experience the conditioned stimulus (ie, the room, equipment) in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus (ie, chemotherapy medication), which should result in a reduction of the conditioned response (ie, AN).  This is an example of extinction.
(Choice A)  Acquisition refers to the learning that takes place as an association is formed between the unconditioned stimulus (eg, food) and the neutral stimulus (eg, bell).
(Choice B)  Stimulus generalization occurs when the conditioned response is elicited by stimuli similar to the original conditioned stimulus.  For example, a dog that has been conditioned to salivate in response to a bell may also salivate to a phone alert.
(Choice D)  Spontaneous recovery occurs when an extinct response reappears after a period of time.  For example, a dog whose salivating response has become extinct will salivate again on hearing a bell a few days after extinction has occurred.
Educational objective:
In classical conditioning, extinction occurs when the conditioned stimulus no longer produces the conditioned response in the absence of the unconditioned stimulus."
518,"If the survey from Study 3 that assessed the patients' level of AN was determined to be reliable, which of the following statements is true?",D,84,"A variety of criteria are used to judge the extent to which scientific findings are credible (ie, can be trusted or believed).  Both the overall study design and particular measures used must be examined for reliability and validity.
Reliability refers to the consistency of an experiment or measure.  Reliable measures produce similar results every time.  For example, two MCAT examinations taken at the same time by the same person on two consecutive days should produce comparable scores.  Similarly, if a study is well designed, it should produce similar results when repeated with new subjects.  This is an indication that an experimental design is highly reliable, also referred to as replicability or reproducibility.
Validity refers to the accuracy of a study or measure (Choice C).  Reliability is typically a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for validity; simply producing the same results does not mean your results reflect reality.  For example, a broken digital thermometer might consistently read 2 degrees above the actual temperature (ie, it is reliable but not valid).
(Choice A)  External validity, also known as generalizability, is the extent to which study results can be applied outside the laboratory to real-life situations.  Experiments in which all variables are tightly controlled may have a high degree of reliability and internal validity but not be very generalizable to the real world.
(Choice B)  Standardization refers to test administration and/or scoring being done in a uniform manner.  Consistency of test administration and scoring allows researchers to better compare one subject or group to the next.
Educational objective:
Reliability describes the degree to which a measure or experiment is consistent (eg, a test produces a similar score for one person who takes it twice).  Validity refers to the accuracy of a measure or experiment (eg, a test accurately assesses what it was designed to measure)."
519,"Based on Figure 1, which conclusion is most likely to be supported?",A,84,"When random assignment to groups is not possible (or ethical) in research involving human subjects, researchers will often conduct a correlational research study.  In these designs, predictor variables may be assessed for their association with outcome variables, although specific causal relationships cannot be determined.
In Study 3, researchers investigated whether a pretreatment expectation of nausea or experience of PN from session #1 was a better predictor of AN at session #3.  Because they could not randomly assign subjects to the condition of whether or not to expect nausea, this is a correlational study design.
Stacked bar graphs are useful for depicting and comparing parts of a whole, with different colors representing different subgroups within a larger group.  Figure 1 illustrates that the group with pretreatment expectations of nausea contained the highest percentage of those who went on to develop AN, which supports the role of cognitive processes (eg, expectations) in associative learning.
(Choice B)  Pretreatment expectation of nausea as a predictor of PN at session #1 is not shown in the graph.
(Choices C and D)  The percentage of patients who went on to develop AN at session #3 was similar to the percentage of patients who did and did not experience PN at session #1.  Neither PN nor a lack of PN at session #1 was as strongly associated with AN at session #3 as pretreatment expectation of nausea.
Educational objective:
When random assignment to conditions is not possible, researchers may use a correlational study design in which predictor variables may be assessed for their association with outcome variables.  Correlational designs do not allow for the determination of causal relationships.  Stacked bar graphs depict data with subgroups that make up the whole."
520,The experimental group in Study 2 was subjected to:,A,84,"Operant conditioning is a type of associative learning whereby an organism learns to connect a behavior with an outcome or consequence, which is known as reinforcement (reward) or punishment (penalty).
Reinforcement encourages behavior.  Positive reinforcement occurs when a desirable stimulus is presented to encourage a behavior.  For example, a toddler receives a treat after successfully using the toilet.  Negative reinforcement occurs when an unpleasant stimulus is withdrawn to encourage a behavior.  For example, a teenager is given a week off from chores after getting good grades.
Punishment discourages behavior.  Positive punishment occurs when an unpleasant stimulus is applied to discourage a behavior.  For example, a toddler gets spanked for running into the street.  Negative punishment occurs when a desirable stimulus is withdrawn to discourage a behavior.  For example, a teenager loses freedom by being grounded for a week after getting bad grades.
In Study 2, earning money for meeting/exceeding a weight-loss goal is positive reinforcement, and taking money away for not meeting a weight-loss goal is negative punishment.
(Choices B, C, and D)  There was no removal of an unpleasant stimulus (negative reinforcement) or application of an unpleasant stimulus (positive punishment) in Study 2.
Educational objective:
Reinforcement encourages certain behaviors:  Positive reinforcement provides a desirable stimulus (eg, receiving candy), whereas negative reinforcement takes away an undesirable stimulus (eg, removing chores).  Punishment discourages certain behaviors:  Positive punishment applies an undesirable stimulus (eg, spanking), whereas negative punishment takes away a desirable stimulus (eg, being grounded takes away freedom)."
521,"Which of the following most accurately reflects the reinforcement schedules used by Study 1 and the experimental group in Study 2, respectively?",B,84,"Schedules are used in operant conditioning to train and/or maintain learned behaviors through reinforcement or punishment.  Continuous schedules provide a reward or punishment after every behavior, which produces the fastest learning using reinforcement and is the most effective way to stop unwanted behavior using punishment.
Partial reinforcement schedules are most often used to maintain learned behaviors, and include:
Fixed ratio:  Behavior rewarded after a consistent number of responses.  For example, a customer loyalty program awards a free coffee after ten coffee purchases.
Variable ratio:  Behavior rewarded after an inconsistent number of responses, usually after some average number of responses, as in Study 1.  The AVG3 schedule might provide a reward after four correct responses, then after two, then after three, and so on.
Fixed interval:  Behavior rewarded after a consistent amount of time, regardless of how many behaviors have occurred.  For example, employees who are paid a weekly salary receive the same amount of money each Friday regardless of how hard they have worked during the week.
Variable interval:  Behavior rewarded after an inconsistent amount of time, regardless of how many behaviors have occurred.  For example, when awaiting an email, the frequency with which users refresh their in-boxes does not affect when a new email arrives.
The reinforcement schedule used by Study 1 was a variable ratio schedule, because the reward was provided after some average number of correct responses.  The reinforcement schedule used for the experimental group in Study 2 was a fixed interval schedule, because rewards occurred on a weekly basis.
(Choice A)  A variable interval schedule provides rewards after unpredictable time increments.  Study 2 provided reinforcement (money) on a fixed time schedule.
(Choices C and D)  A fixed ratio schedule provides a reward for a set number of correct responses.  Study 1 provided rewards after an average number of correct responses, consistent with a variable ratio schedule.
Educational objective:
Reinforcement schedules can be continuous (reward given every time) or partial.  Partial schedules include fixed or variable ratio (reward given after consistent or inconsistent number of behaviors) and fixed or variable interval (reward given after consistent or inconsistent amount of time)."
522,Which of the following behavioral patterns is most expected of participants in the Study 2 experimental group?  Participants are most diligent with dieting and exercise:,C,84,"Each schedule of reinforcement produces characteristic behavioral response patterns.  The ratio schedules, which provide reinforcement after a consistent (fixed) or inconsistent (variable) number of behavioral responses, both produce rapid response rates.  The interval schedules, which provide reinforcement after a consistent (fixed) or inconsistent (variable) amount of time, both produce slower response rates.
Fixed interval schedules (eg, providing a weekly weight-loss incentive) tend to produce increased behavioral responses just before the reward and a decreased pattern of responding just after the reward is received.  For example, people tend to work harder and faster at the end of the week, just before receiving their weekly paychecks, and tend to be slower and more sluggish at the beginning of the week, after receiving their weekly paychecks.
Therefore, participants in the Study 2 experimental group who are on a fixed interval schedule should demonstrate similar behaviors.  They should be most diligent with their diet and exercise regimens just before their weekly weigh-ins and least diligent with dieting and exercise right after the weekly weigh-in, regardless of whether they have earned or lost money (Choices A and B).
(Choice D)  Variable interval schedules of reinforcement tend to produce slow and steady behavioral responses because the subject has no idea when the next reward is coming and the reward is not linked to behavior.  For example, people tend to check email sporadically but consistently throughout the day (a slow and steady rate), because new email (a reinforcer) is received at unpredictable times that do not correspond to how often a person checks for email.
Educational objective:
Reinforcement schedules produce characteristic behavioral response patterns:  Ratio schedules produce rapid response rates, whereas interval schedules produce slower response rates.  Fixed interval reinforcement schedules tend to produce increased behavior just before the reward and decreased behavior just after."
523,Both studies use which of the following?,B,84,"In operant conditioning, reinforcers encourage behavior whereas punishers discourage behavior.  Reinforcers and punishers can be primary (innate) or secondary (learned).
Primary reinforcers fulfill a biological urge and are naturally rewarding.  Examples of primary reinforcers are food, comforting physical contact, and praise.  Secondary reinforcers are not inherently rewarding but are conditioned to be desirable through associative learning.  For example, if a child brings home good grades, the parent may reinforce this behavior with praise or candy (primary reinforcers) so the child feels happy.  The child then associates feeling good with good grades, resulting in grades becoming a secondary reinforcer.
Primary punishers are naturally undesirable and cause negative emotions such as pain or fear.  Examples of primary punishers include an electric shock or a loud noise.  Secondary punishers are not inherently negative but are conditioned to be undesirable through associative learning.  For example, if a child brings home bad grades, the parent may punish this behavior with a scolding (primary punisher) so the child feels bad.  The child then associates feeling bad with bad grades, resulting in grades becoming a secondary punisher.
Both studies use money, a secondary reinforcer, as a reward.
(Choice A)  Study 1 uses a food reward as a primary reinforcer.  Study 2 does not include any primary reinforcement.
(Choice C)  Neither study employs a primary punisher, such as a painful or fear-inducing stimulus.
(Choice D)  Study 1 does not use any form of punishment.  Study 2 uses the removal of a desirable stimulus (money) as a form of punishment, but this is referred to as negative punishment, not as a secondary punisher.
Educational objective:
Reinforcers encourage behavior; punishers discourage behavior.  Reinforcers and punishers can be primary (innate) or secondary (learned).  Primary reinforcers are innately desirable (eg, food), whereas secondary reinforcers are made desirable through learning (eg, good grades).  Primary punishers are innately undesirable (eg, electric shock), whereas secondary punishers are made undesirable through learning (eg, bad grades)."
524,Suppose one of the participants in Study 1 earned several candy bars and became very ill after consuming them.  This participant would most likely:,C,84,"A learned taste aversion is a specific and powerful type of classical conditioning that occurs when an organism becomes ill after consuming something (eg, food, alcohol).  Whatever was consumed prior to the illness becomes associated with the illness (even if it did not cause the illness) and is avoided by the organism afterward.
Unlike other forms of typical classical conditioning, which require two stimuli to be paired together repeatedly before the organism learns to associate the two, a taste aversion develops after just one pairing.  In other words, an organism needs to become ill only once to associate the food consumed with the illness.
Similarly, whereas typical classical conditioning requires the two stimuli to be presented within a very short time frame for the organism to learn to associate them, taste aversions occur despite hours passing between the consumption of a food and subsequent illness.
Finally, whereas typical classical conditioning rapidly extinguishes when the two stimuli are no longer paired, taste aversions have long durations.  In other words, once becoming ill, the organism will likely never consume the associated food again.
(Choice A)  Although it is possible that the research participant might associate her participation in the study with becoming ill, she is most likely to associate her illness with the food, not the study or studies in general.
(Choice B)  It is unlikely that the participant will associate the illness with the computer game.  Taste aversions almost always link illness with foods (or smells), which is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation.
(Choice D)  Taste aversions are long-enduring associations; they are not short-term.
Educational objective:
Taste aversion is a specific and powerful type of classical conditioning that occurs after just one instance of becoming ill following the consumption of something.  Taste aversions can develop despite many hours passing between consumption and illness and are long-lasting."
525,The participants' motivational state:,A,84,"The purpose of Study 1 was to assess how weight corresponds to the type of reward a subject selects.  The participants received rewards for correct answers during a computer game, with subsequent rewards becoming more challenging to earn for those who selected the food reward.  The researchers manipulated the reward schedule (independent variable) to measure selection of the food or money reward (dependent variable).
Hunger might impact whether a participant was more likely to select a food reward, so hunger level was a potential confounding variable, one that might affect the results if not controlled for or eliminated by the researcher.  Therefore, motivational state was controlled for by ensuring that levels of hunger were not significantly different among participants, assessed using self-report measures.  If hunger levels had not been the same, any findings could be attributed to varying baseline levels of hunger rather than BMI.
(Choice B)  The purpose of Study 2 was to assess how earning or losing money (independent variables) might impact weight loss (dependent variable).  Therefore, if motivation were used to assign participants to the control or experimental group, this would result in groups that were fundamentally different, with results that could not be compared.  To compare results, participants need to be assigned randomly (as they were in Study 2), such that average motivation levels between groups are similar.
(Choice C)  Study 1 did not contain an experimental and control group; all participants were given a choice of reward, a decision that was correlated to BMI.
(Choice D)  Motivation was not directly assessed in either study, although it could be inferred that participants in Study 2 were motivated by monetary rewards to lose weight.  However, because obese participants were randomly assorted into two groups, it is not possible to correlate BMI with motivation, as the average BMI of each group should be comparable.
Educational objective:
Potential confounding variables, such as motivation, must be controlled for at the outset of a study.  Subjective states like hunger can be measured.  If the groups do not vary in terms of the potential confounding variable, then any significant differences may be attributed to the independent variable(s)."
526,"If a neuroimaging study compared normal dreaming with lucid dreaming, in what brain region would more activity be expected during lucid dreaming?",B,84,"The prefrontal cortex is associated with executive functions, such as critical thinking, problem solving, planning, impulse control, and executive decision-making.  Because lucid dreaming involves critical analysis and executive decision making, a neuroimaging study would be expected to demonstrate greater activation of the prefrontal cortex during lucid dreaming as compared with normal dreaming.
The prefrontal cortex is the anterior portion of the frontal lobe, which also contains the primary motor cortex (responsible for the initiation of voluntary movement) and Broca area (involved in speech production).
(Choice A)  The cerebellum is positioned underneath the occipital lobe at the back of the skull and is associated with motor coordination and motor learning.  This region would not necessarily be more active during lucid dreaming compared with normal dreaming.
(Choice C)  The amygdala is part of the limbic system located on either side of the thalamus deep in the cortex; it is associated with processing emotion, particularly fear and anger.  Although this region may be active during lucid dreaming, it is probably no more active than during normal dreaming.
(Choice D)  Located in the occipital lobe, the primary visual cortex is associated with processing visual input from the retinas and is not expected to be as active during dreaming, when there is no external visual input.  However, secondary visual areas of the brain have been associated with the visual imagery that occurs during dreaming.
Educational objective:
The prefrontal cortex is involved in executive decision making and critical analysis.  It is located in the frontal lobe, which also contains the primary motor cortex."
527,"If a lucid dreamer falls asleep at 10:00 PM and wakes up at 6:00 AM, during what period of sleep would this person have the greatest chance of lucid dreaming?",C,84,"Sleep is broadly divided into non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (stages 1-4) and rapid eye movement (REM).  One sleep cycle includes various proportions of REM and NREM sleep, each lasting about 90 minutes.  There are approximately 4-6 sleep cycles in a typical night's sleep.
The amount of time spent in each sleep stage differs over the course of a single night's sleep; a typical adult spends about 75% of sleep time in NREM sleep and 25% in REM sleep.  The time spent in REM varies, increasing in duration for each subsequent sleep cycle, with the last cycle containing the most REM sleep.
Studies suggest that dreaming occurs during both REM and NREM sleep but is most common during REM sleep, particularly during the REM cycles that occur closer to waking.  REM dreams tend to be more vivid and memorable and are more likely to be recalled upon waking.  Studies suggest lucid dreaming occurs only during REM sleep.
An individual sleeping from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM would have the greatest chance of lucid dreaming during the last sleep cycle, from 4:00 AM to 6:00 AM, because the greatest proportion of REM sleep occurs just before waking.
(Choice A)  The shortest REM period occurs during the first sleep cycle (10:00 PM to 11:30 PM), so there is the least chance of lucid dreaming during this time.
(Choice B)  The greatest chance of having a lucid dream is during one of the longer REM periods that occur during the last sleep cycle, rather than during REM sleep that occurs in the middle of the night (1:00 AM to 3:00 AM).
(Choice D)  Because REM periods increase in duration during the night with each subsequent sleep cycle, the chances of having a lucid dream are not equal throughout the night.
Educational objective:
Dreaming, which occurs during both REM and NREM sleep, is more common, vivid, and easily recalled when it occurs during REM sleep.  The duration of REM sleep is shortest earlier in the night and longest during the last sleep cycle, which occurs in the early morning hours."
528,A mechanism for researchers to monitor a dream state would be provided by tracking which of the following?,A,84,"Dreaming is most often associated with REM sleep, particularly the visually intense dreams remembered after waking.  Also known as paradoxical sleep, REM sleep is characterized by brain activity (measured by electroencephalography [EEG]) that resembles the beta waves seen in an awake, alert state, except there is no muscle tone in the body.  This prevents the dreamer from acting out the dream, which could result in injury.  The only exceptions to this systemic paralysis are the muscles controlling the eyes and the cardiopulmonary system.
Although the body is functionally paralyzed during REM sleep, the eye muscles are very active and cause the characteristic closed-eye movements (ie, rapid eye movements) from which this state derives its name.  Therefore, researchers can track closed-eye movements to monitor a dream state.
Physiological changes are also characteristic of REM sleep.  Cardiovascular and respiratory activities become very regular and gradually decrease, along with temperature, during NREM sleep.  During REM sleep, body temperature drops to its lowest point, while cardiovascular and respiratory activities become irregular and increase.
(Choice B)  EEG measurements showing K-complexes demonstrate the presence of stage 2 sleep.
(Choice C)  Spikes in the release of growth hormone (GH) coincide with deep sleep stages 3 and 4.
(Choice D)  Sudden, jerking body movements occur when an individual first falls asleep and enters stage 1 sleep.
Educational objective:
During NREM sleep, cardiopulmonary activity becomes regular and decreases, along with body temperature.  During REM sleep, cardiopulmonary activity becomes irregular and increases, while body temperature drops to its lowest point.  REM sleep is also characterized by rapid closed-eye movements, muscle paralysis, and brain activity resembling a waking state."
529,"If the researchers wanted to examine the role of sleep in memory consolidation, which of the following groups, if added to the current study design, would best accomplish this goal?",B,84,"There is growing evidence that sleep is a vital part of memory consolidation, a series of processes that stabilizes a memory trace after its initial acquisition during waking consciousness.  The hippocampus, which is part of the limbic system, plays an integral role in memory consolidation.  The limbic system, a network of brain regions that also includes the amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, and cingulate gyrus, is involved in emotion, learning, and memory.
In order for the researchers to examine the role of sleep in memory consolidation, the best group to add to the current study design would be a group of nonlucid dreamers who practiced the task but did not sleep between the pretest and posttest (""waking practice/no sleep"").
By comparing the results of the ""waking practice/no sleep"" group with those of the ""waking practice"" group, the researchers could examine if sleep was helpful for consolidating memory generated through task practice because the two groups differ by only one variable, the presence or absence of sleep.
(Choice A)  Adding a group of lucid dreamers who practiced the task while sleeping and while awake would not be useful because there would be no comparison group that did not sleep, and it would not be possible to differentiate the effects of waking practice vs. sleeping practice within this group.
(Choice C)  Adding a ""no practice/no sleep"" group would be less useful than adding a ""waking practice/no sleep"" group.  Researchers could compare the results of the ""no practice/no sleep"" group with the ""no practice"" group to see if no practice alone produces little task improvement (the two groups would have similar results) or if no practice and no sleep is worse than no practice alone.  Because the added group would not be practicing, however, it would be less useful for examining if sleep plays a role in memory consolidation.
(Choice D)  Since both the ""waking practice"" and ""no practice"" groups slept, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the role of sleep in memory consolidation by comparing the results from these two groups.
Educational objective:
The hippocampus plays a critical role in the formation of new memories through the process of memory consolidation, which stabilizes a memory trace after its initial acquisition during waking consciousness.  Sleep appears to play an important role in memory consolidation."
530,"Compared with the study described in the second paragraph, the proposed follow-up study should demonstrate:",C,84,"In general, as a study becomes more tightly controlled and confounding variables are limited, internal validity tends to increase but external validity tends to decrease.
Internal validity is mostly concerned with causality, or the extent to which changes in the dependent variable can be attributed to changes in the independent variable.  The presence of confounding variables, which are additional variables that might influence results or outcomes, decreases internal validity by introducing the possibility that results are attributable to a confounding variable and not to the independent variable of interest.
External validity is mostly concerned with generalizability, or the extent to which results can be applied to other situations (eg, outside the laboratory) or beyond the sample to the larger population.
Allowing participants a single night's sleep at home introduces many variables not controlled by the study, such as time of sleep onset, quality of sleep, and duration of sleep.  Standardizing the timing and duration of sleep by having participants sleep in a sleep lab creates an unnatural sleeping environment for the subjects.  Therefore, the proposed follow-up study should demonstrate greater internal validity, because there should be fewer confounding variables, but less external validity, because the findings will be less applicable to a population with a more natural sleep experience.
(Choices A and B)  If the researchers repeat the study and better control for sleep onset and duration, this will result in greater (not less) internal validity.
(Choice D)  Limiting confounding variables occurring in real life decreases the external validity of a study.
Educational objective:
Internal validity measures the extent to which a causal relationship can be concluded from the study, and external validity measures the extent to which the study results can be generalized beyond the study.  Typically, increases in internal validity result in decreases in external validity, and vice versa."
531,Which of the following conclusions is most supported by Figure 1?,B,84,"The results of the lucid dreaming study described in the passage are illustrated with a box-and-whisker plot, which is used to visually represent the median and the distribution of the data into quartile ranges:
The upper quartile (Q3; 75% of the data lies below this value), shown as the top edge of the box.
The median (50% of the data lies below this value), which is the line inside the box.
The lower quartile (Q1; 25% of the data lies below this value), shown as the bottom edge of the box.
The maximum and minimum data points, shown as whiskers, are data values no more than 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR) from the edge of the box.  The IQR is equal to the difference between the upper and lower quartiles.
Outliers, shown as data points outside the maximum and minimum data points.
Confidence intervals (CIs) represent a measure of uncertainty in a reported value by indicating how far the value reported might be from the true value (eg, true median).  Theoretically, a 95% CI indicates that if the same population were sampled countless times and CIs were calculated each time, the resulting intervals would contain the true population value in approximately 95% of the cases.
A notch that represents the 95% CI of the median is used on the box-and-whisker plot to estimate visually whether the medians of two groups are significantly different.  If the notches across two groups do not overlap, the medians of the two groups are probably significantly different.
In Figure 1, the notches of both the ""waking practice"" and ""lucid practice"" groups are higher than and do not overlap with the notch of the ""no practice"" group, so the two practice groups are assumed to have improved significantly more on the task than the ""no practice"" group.  However, one cannot conclude from the figure that a significant difference exists between groups when notches do overlap.
(Choice A)  An individual from the ""waking practice"" group (not the ""lucid practice"" group) demonstrated the lowest improvement of all members.
(Choice C)  The ""lucid practice"" group's lowest quartile was completely below the ""no practice"" group's highest quartile, indicating less improvement for the ""lucid practice"" group's lowest quartile.
(Choice D)  Box-and-whisker plots provide information about the median, not the mean or the mode.
Educational objective:
Box-and-whisker plots visually represent the median value and interquartile range.  Notched box plots show the 95% confidence interval around the median.  If notches do not overlap, medians can generally be inferred to be statistically significantly different."
532,Which of the following r values for the correlation between depressive symptoms and medication adherence in individuals with schizophrenia best supports the research presented in the first paragraph?,C,84,"Comorbidity refers to the simultaneous presentation of two or more psychological disorders.  If an individual with schizophrenia also has depression (a mood disorder), the two disorders are comorbid.  Comorbid disorders often interact with each other, worsening the course of either or both.  Disorders are thought to co-occur because they have common risk factors, such as genetic predisposition or environmental stressors.
A correlation coefficient (r value) describes the linear relationship between two variables; r values range from −1 to 1 and describe the direction (sign) and strength of an association.
The sign of the r value indicates a positive or negative association, and the closer r is to −1 or 1, the stronger the relationship.  Correlations describe relationships between variables, but it is not possible to determine if one variable caused the change in the other.
Fewer depressive symptoms were moderately associated with higher rates of medication compliance (ie, as depressive symptoms decrease, medication compliance increases); therefore, the research presented in the first paragraph is best supported by the negative and moderate r value of −0.35.
(Choices A and B)  +0.95 and +0.30 reflect positive, not negative, correlations.
(Choices A and D)  +0.95 and −0.90 reflect very strong, not moderate, correlations.
Educational objective:
The correlation coefficient (r value) describes a linear relationship between two variables.  The r value ranges from −1 to 1 and reflects the strength and direction (positive or negative) of the linear association between these two variables.  Comorbidity refers to the simultaneous presentation of two or more psychological disorders."
533,"Based on the symptoms of schizophrenia, which statement is accurate regarding the symptoms measured by the SPI?",A,84,"Psychotic disorders are severe psychological disorders characterized by a loss of contact with reality.  Schizophrenia is the most common psychotic disorder, with a prevalence of about 1% in the United States.
Schizophrenia typically involves both positive symptoms, which are ""pathological excesses"" (eg, hallucinations, delusions, disorganized speech), and negative symptoms, which are ""pathological deficits"" (eg, apathy, inability to experience pleasure).  Many people with schizophrenia also experience psychomotor symptoms (ie, changes in muscle tone or activity), which can occur either as a symptom of schizophrenia or as a side effect of medication.
Incoherent speech, a positive symptom of schizophrenia, would be assessed by the PSS (Positive Symptom Scale).
(Choice B)  Delusions are a positive symptom of schizophrenia, so they would be assessed by the PSS (Positive Symptom Scale), not the NSS (Negative Symptom Scale).
(Choice C)  Emotional flattening is a negative symptom of schizophrenia, so it would be assessed by the NSS (Negative Symptom Scale), not the PSS (Positive Symptom Scale).
(Choice D)  Reduced need for sleep is a symptom of mania, which is also characterized by increased energy or agitation, flight of ideas (rapid thoughts), feelings of grandiosity, distractibility, and/or impulsive or reckless behaviors.  Mania is indicative of bipolar disorder (not psychosis or schizophrenia), so it would not be assessed by the SPI.
Educational objective:
Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder characterized by positive symptoms (eg, hallucinations, delusions, incoherent speech) and negative symptoms (eg, apathy, emotional flattening, social withdrawal)."
534,Which conclusion is best supported by the data in Table 1?,D,84,"When diagnosing, detecting, or predicting the development or presence of a medical condition, two types of errors are possible: A false-positive error occurs when the condition is predicted (or said) to be present but in reality is absent; a false-negative error occurs when the condition is predicted (or said) to be absent but in reality is present.
In the passage, the Speech Model correctly predicted 10 of the 11 cases of psychosis, whereas the SPI Model predicted only seven of the 11 cases.  Therefore, the Speech Model was a better predictor of psychosis than the SPI Model.
(Choice A)  The SPI Model resulted in more (not fewer) false positives (nine) than the Speech Model (one).
(Choice B)  Although the Speech Model predicted that 11 participants would develop psychosis, one of those did not do so (ie, there was one false positive).
(Choice C)  The table reflects the ability of each model to predict the future occurrence or diagnosis of psychosis; the data therein do not reflect which symptoms are less (or more) critical to the diagnosis itself.
Educational objective:
The detection of a medical condition can result in two types of errors.  A false positive occurs when the condition is said to be present but in reality is not.  A false negative occurs when the condition is said to be absent, but in reality is present."
535,Which of the following would support the claim that the SPI is a valid assessment?,B,84,"A variety of criteria are used to judge the extent to which scientific findings are credible (ie, can be trusted or believed).  Both the overall study design and particular measures used must be examined for reliability and validity.
Validity refers to the accuracy of a study or measure.  Internal validity refers to the extent to which a measure or experiment produces a true result.  External validity, also known as generalizability, is the extent to which study results can be applied outside the laboratory to real-life situations.
The validity of the SPI would be supported by scores that positively correlated to an already established measure of psychotic symptoms because when two different inventories that measure the same construct (eg, psychotic symptoms) are correlated, the validity (ie, accuracy) of both measures is supported.
(Choices A and C)  Reliability refers to the extent to which an experiment or measure can consistently produce similar results every time.  SPI scores that were positively correlated from one administration to the next and SPI scores that are similar regardless of interviewer both reflect two different types of reliability (not validity).
(Choice D)  If SPI scores were similar for all participants, regardless of their diagnosis at the end of the study, this would undermine its validity; the SPI was designed to detect the presence of psychotic symptoms and should produce significantly different scores for people who later have a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder and those who do not.
Educational objective:
Validity refers to the accuracy of a measure or experiment (eg, a test accurately assesses what it was designed to measure).  Reliability describes the degree to which a measure or experiment is consistent (eg, a test produces a similar score for one person who takes it twice)."
536,Which of the following is accurate regarding the design of the study described in the passage?,A,84,"A scientific hypothesis is a testable explanation for a phenomenon.  The alternative hypothesis is based on prior evidence and assumes that a significant relationship or difference exists between variables (and often predicts the nature of that relationship or difference).  In this study, the alternative hypothesis was that a significant difference would be found between statistical models of speech pattern features and clinical symptom assessments in the accuracy of psychosis prediction.
The inverse of the alternative hypothesis, the null hypothesis, states that there is no significant difference or relationship between the variables measured.  Here, the null hypothesis was that no significant difference would be found between computer models of speech pattern features and scores on the SPI in the prediction of future psychosis.
Therefore, the null hypothesis is that speech pattern features and scores on the SPI will predict psychosis with similar accuracy.
(Choice B)  This study was observational, so no true independent variable was manipulated by the researcher to establish a causal relationship.  The speech pattern features and SPI measure are predictive variables assumed to indicate the risk of future psychosis.
(Choice C)  All the study participants either met criteria for prodromal symptoms (preclinical signs of psychosis) or had a first-degree relative with schizophrenia.  This study sought to determine whether speech pattern features or the SPI measure (not prodromal symptoms alone) could predict the development of psychosis.
(Choice D)  Researchers were interested in determining whether certain speech patterns or a standard clinical inventory better predicted the development of psychosis, not the severity of disease.
Educational objective:
The null hypothesis states that no significant difference or relationship exists between variables, whereas the alternative hypothesis assumes that a significant relationship or difference does exist between variables."
537,Researchers did not recruit individuals in the age range that corresponds to the generativity vs. stagnation conflict in Erikson's theory of psychosocial development.  Which statement provides the most likely explanation for the researchers' decision?,B,84,"Erikson developed a theory of psychosocial development involving eight stages across the human life span.  Each stage is associated with an age-related crisis, which is an opportunity for individual growth and social development.  Resolution does not necessarily occur in each stage before an individual moves onto the next.  Erikson proposed that unresolved conflict forms the basis for adult psychopathology.
The age range corresponding to Erikson's generativity vs. stagnation stage is middle adulthood, or approximately 40–65.  This stage is marked by feelings of productivity for individuals who have made successful contributions to society and feelings of stagnation for those who have not.
The passage states that schizophrenia typically begins in early adulthood.  Because the study aimed to test the ability of two different models to predict the future development of psychosis, a major component of schizophrenia, researchers did not recruit individuals in the age range corresponding to generativity vs. stagnation, as they would be older than the typical age of first active psychotic symptom onset in schizophrenia.
(Choice A)  Elderly age (ie, 65 and older) is associated with Erikson's integrity vs. despair stage, not the generativity vs. stagnation stage.
(Choice C)  Vygotsky proposed that language and cognition develop separately in infancy and merge in early childhood, not middle adulthood (ie, the age corresponding to generativity vs. stagnation).
(Choice D)  This study focused on the ability of two different models to predict the future development of psychosis; later interindividual variability in the course of schizophrenia was not relevant to the aim of this study and therefore did not influence the selection of participants.
Educational objective:
Erikson's theory of psychosocial development includes eight stages that encompass the human life span.  Each stage is associated with a crisis involving a conflict that provides an opportunity for growth."
538,Which of the following best summarizes a difference between Korsakoff Syndrome (KS) and Alzheimer Disease (AD)?,D,84,"Korsakoff syndrome
Symptoms
Memory loss
Confabulation (memory fabrication
without the intention to lie)
Causes
Extreme thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency resulting from:
Chronic alcohol consumption (most common)
Eating disorders &/or chronic malnutrition
Treatment/prognosis
Vitamin B1 supplementation can reverse most/all symptoms if caught early
The umbrella term dementia describes a decline in one or more aspects of cognitive functioning (eg, memory, attention, executive functioning, perception, motor organization, language, social cognition).  Declines result in poorer social, occupational, and/or daily functioning and can be associated with personality changes and difficulty regulating emotions.  Although dementia can be caused by a range of diseases or brain injury, dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common type.
Dementia due to Korsakoff syndrome (KS) is caused by a deficiency in thiamin (vitamin B1), typically resulting from chronic alcohol consumption (alcohol use disorder).  People with alcohol use disorder generally have poor diets, and alcohol interferes with the absorption of thiamin in the digestive tract.
Thiamin, an essential nutrient obtained from one's diet, is necessary for proper neural functioning.  Deficiency leads to cell death, particularly in the thalamus, the primary relay station for sensory information en route to the cerebral cortex, and the mammillary bodies, which have extensive connections with the hippocampus (memory formation).
Thiamin supplementation and behavior modification in the early stages of KS can potentially reverse most brain damage, but AD is irreversible, ultimately progressing to global cell death and severe brain atrophy.
(Choice A)  KS and AD both have physiological components; AD is caused by abnormal beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles that interfere with proper neural signaling and result in cell death.
(Choice B)  KS and AD both have environmental as well as genetic components.  KS results from excessive alcohol consumption and poor nutrition (environmental), but alcohol use disorder appears to be at least partially heritable (genetic).  Risk factors for AD include a mutation causing greater amyloid plaque accumulation (genetic) and many lifestyle factors (environmental).
(Choice C)  KS and AD are both associated with biochemical changes in the brain that ultimately result in neuronal cell death.
Educational objective:
Dementia is an umbrella term that reflects a decline in one or more aspects of cognitive functioning.  Dementia due to Korsakoff syndrome (KS) is caused by thiamin deficiency and is most commonly the result of chronic alcohol consumption.  Thiamin supplementation during the early stages of KS can reverse most symptoms of KS."
539,Which of the following cognitive abilities is critical to the Corsi block-tapping task and would be MOST affected by a lesion to the right hemisphere?,C,84,"The brain is divided into right and left hemispheres, each of which is specialized for certain processes; this specialization is known as hemispheric lateralization.  Each hemisphere is responsible for contralateral control of the body: the left hemisphere controls touch and movement on the right side of the body, and vice versa.
The right hemisphere is crucial for processing visuospatial patterns, such as those required for the Corsi block-tapping task; deficits in visuospatial processing are often indicative of damage to the right hemisphere.  In addition to visuospatial processing, the right hemisphere is important for artistic and musical abilities, visualization, and emotion.
(Choice A)  Although the right hemisphere is specialized for processing emotion, that cognitive ability is not critical to the Corsi block-tapping task.
(Choices B and D)  The left hemisphere is important for language ability, including speaking, writing, and comprehension.  The left hemisphere is also superior at analytical reasoning skills and logic, which are used in mathematics and science.  The Corsi block-tapping task relies on comprehension of verbal instructions, but not on analytical reasoning skills.
Educational objective:
Hemispheric lateralization is the specialization of each brain hemisphere for certain cognitive functions.  The right hemisphere is specialized for visuospatial, emotional, and artistic/musical processing.  The left hemisphere is specialized for linguistic and analytical processing."
540,"Performance of which of the following study tasks utilizes the mirror neuron system?
Immediate recall task
Delayed recall task
Distractor task",D,84,"Studies suggest that mirror neurons are specialized neurons in the brain that fire both while observing and while performing a behavior.  Mirror neurons have been observed in various brain regions (eg, frontal and parietal lobes) of humans, other primates, and some birds, and are hypothesized to play a central role in observational learning.
Observational learning (also called modeling) describes when an individual learns how to perform a behavior by watching someone else perform that behavior.  Watching and replicating movements, such as during the Corsi block-tapping task, is a form of observational learning, which is thought to utilize the mirror neuron system.
(Number I)  As part of the Corsi block-tapping task, the immediate recall task requires subjects to touch the same blocks as the experimenter immediately afterward, which would rely on the mirror neuron system.
(Number II)  The delayed recall task requires subjects to touch the same blocks the experimenter touched after a delay of 5–25 seconds; this is an example of observational learning and would also rely on the mirror neuron system.
(Number III)  The distractor task requires subjects to watch and reproduce a finger-tapping sequence first demonstrated by the experimenter, which would also rely on the mirror neuron system.
Educational objective:
Located in various areas of the brain, mirror neurons are specialized neurons that fire both while observing and performing a behavior.  Mirror neurons are hypothesized to play a central role in observational learning."
541,The distractor and Corsi block-tapping tasks are designed to assess which of the following?,C,84,"During the Corsi block-tapping task, the experimenter touches a sequence of blocks.  The subject must then recall the exact sequence performed by the experimenter, after either no delay or a short (5–25 second) delay, during which the subject performs a distractor task.  In other words, the subject must hold the information in short-term memory, which has a duration of 15–30 seconds.  Therefore, the Corsi block-tapping task is a measure of visuospatial short-term memory.
Exposure to a distraction can interfere with the ability to accurately retrieve a memory or learn new information.  Retroactive interference occurs when more recently learned information interferes with the learning of older information.  In this study, the distractor task retroactively interfered with subjects' ability to remember the Corsi block sequence.
(Choice A)  Sensory memory temporarily stores information from our senses, such as visual or auditory stimuli, just long enough to be transferred to short-term memory.  Sensory memory has the shortest duration, from less than 1 second (visual stimuli) to up to 1–2 seconds (auditory stimuli).  Sensory memory would not have lasted long enough to aid the subjects in recalling the Corsi block sequence, especially following a distractor task.
(Choice B)  Proactive interference occurs when older information interferes with the recall of newer information.  If subjects had trouble remembering the Corsi block sequence because of a finger-tapping task learned the day before, this would be an example of proactive interference.  Episodic memory involves personally relevant information (eg, names of former high school classmates) and was not assessed in this study.
(Choice D)  Semantic memory, which was not assessed in this study, involves the recall of facts (eg, names of state capitals).
Educational objective:
Proactive interference occurs when previously learned information interferes with the learning of new information.  Retroactive interference occurs when more recent information interferes with the recall of previously learned information."
542,"Based on study results and the legend below, which of the following graphs best displays the mean and 95% confidence intervals for accuracy scores for each group?",C,84,"Error bars may represent several types of statistics (eg, confidence intervals, standard deviations, standard errors).  Interpretation of error bars depends on which statistic is depicted.
Confidence intervals (CIs) address how well a sample statistic (eg, mean) estimates a true population value by providing a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter (eg, mean) of interest.  On the graph, the points depict the group mean and the CIs depict the uncertainty of the mean considering the sample size and the variability of the measurement.
Graphically, CIs may help determine statistical significance:  Whenever CIs do not overlap, group means are statistically significantly different.  However, the opposite is not always true; whenever CIs overlap, group means may or may not be statistically different.
This study used a mixed factorial design.  It assessed between-groups factors by testing two or more groups simultaneously to examine differences between groups.  It also evaluated within-groups (or repeated measures) factors by assessing the same subjects at several time points to determine if there was a significant change over time.
This study produced two statistically significant findings: (1) the AD and the KS groups were significantly impaired on the delayed memory task compared to controls (between-groups finding), and (2) all subjects showed a significantly greater mean number of errors as the delay interval increased (within-groups finding).
Therefore, an accurate representation of results should include the following: (1) CIs for the AD and the KS groups that do not overlap with those for the control group, and (2) CIs for the final time points (ie, 25-second delay interval) in all groups that do not overlap with their corresponding initial time points (ie, 0 seconds).
(Choices A and B)  The CIs for the KS and the AD groups do not overlap, suggesting that subjects with AD and KS performed significantly differently compared to each other, which was not a finding mentioned in the passage.
(Choice D)  Every CI for the control group at each delayed condition included the initial time point (ie, 0 seconds) mean score, suggesting that performance for controls remained unchanged.  This representation contradicts the finding that all subjects showed a statistically significant greater mean number of errors as the delay interval increased.
Educational objective:
Between-groups factors compare two or more groups to determine whether there is a difference between group outcome means.  Within-groups factors (repeated measures) compare the outcomes for the same group at different times to determine whether there is a change in the outcome.  Confidence intervals (CIs) graphically convey the uncertainty of statistics (eg, mean); if CIs do not overlap, the two means are statistically significantly different; however, the opposite is not always true."
543,"Matching the healthy control group in terms of age, gender, and premorbid IQ was meant to account for all of the following, EXCEPT for the:",B,84,"Cognitive development is influenced by both heredity and environment.  Biological factors affecting cognition include structural changes to the brain due to damage or illness and heredity (eg, gene and protein expression).  Environmental factors (eg, drug use) also influence the physiology of the brain, impacting cognition.
The purpose of the study was to assess differences in nonverbal recall in subjects with cognitive dysfunction compared to healthy controls.  The control group was matched to the experimental groups in terms of age, gender, and premorbid IQ.  Matching is meant to account for confounding variables that might have an effect on the dependent variable (recall).  For example, if the mean age of the control group had been 25, it would have been impossible to determine whether age or time had an effect on recall.
Age, gender, and IQ are all factors that significantly impact cognition, but they can be controlled in an experiment.  Subjects' individual experiences with the environment vary widely and are much more difficult, if not impossible, to control.  In most human studies, it is difficult to control for environmental factors, such as stress, drug and alcohol use, chemical exposure, social factors, and medical care, because such factors vary widely across individuals.
(Choice A)  Matching does account for biological factors (eg, age, gender, and IQ) that affect cognition.
(Choice C)  Matching does account for the cognitive changes that occur in late adulthood (eg, declines in processing speed, memory recall, formation of new episodic memories).
(Choice D)  Matching does account for premorbid IQ, which often predicts cognitive functioning.  Different types of intelligence are correlated, so intelligence must be controlled for in the experiment.
Educational objective:
Matching ensures that only the independent variable has an effect on the dependent variable.  Subjects may be matched for biological factors (eg, age, gender, IQ), but it is harder to control for environmental factors, such as stress, chemicals, and social factors."
544,The data presented in the passage are LEAST likely to have been obtained from which type of study?,D,84,"Types of studies in the health sciences

Data from multiple studies are statistically combined & analyzed
Randomized controlled trials involve the random assignment of subjects into treatment and control groups (eg, patients are randomly assigned to receive a new drug or a placebo), and causal conclusions can be drawn from the results.  No data in the passage involve efficacy of a treatment/intervention or a causal relationship, so the data were least likely to have been obtained from randomized controlled trials.
(Choice A)  Cross-sectional studies are observational studies that assess data from a large section of the population at a given point and can determine the prevalence of a disease.  The statistic that ""as many as half of all individuals diagnosed with BD actually do not have the disorder"" was most likely from a cross-sectional study.
(Choice B)  Longitudinal studies are observational studies that gather data over time.  The statistic that ""almost 70% of patients [receive] an initial misdiagnosis and almost 35% [remain] misdiagnosed for 10 years or more"" most likely came from a longitudinal study.
(Choice C)  Case studies are observational studies that assess one or more individuals in depth over a certain period.  The quotes from the patients in the passage were likely taken from a case study.
Educational objective:
The health sciences use three main study designs:  Reviews, experimental studies (causality can be inferred), and observational studies (causality cannot be inferred).  Randomized controlled trials determine treatment efficacy by comparing randomly assigned groups.  Cross-sectional studies can determine disease prevalence.  Cohort studies observe changes in a group over time.  Case studies provide an in-depth analysis of one or a few individuals."
545,"Based on the information in the passage and sick role theory, which statement best describes a potential explanation for the underdiagnosis of BD?  Underdiagnosis of BD is the result of:",D,84,"Sick role theory (Talcott Parsons)
Rights
1.  Exemption from normal social roles & responsibilities
2.  Lack of accountability for illness
Obligations
1.  Must attempt to get well
2.  Must seek & comply with treatment
In sociology, sick role theory conceptualizes illness as a socially acceptable form of deviance.  When ill, an individual enters into the ""sick role,"" a socially defined status with rights and obligations:
Rights:  The sick person has the right to be exempt from playing other social roles while sick (eg, employee) and is excused from fulfilling normal responsibilities (eg, going to work).  The sick person also has the right to not be held responsible for the illness.
Obligations:  The sick person has the responsibility to make every reasonable effort to get well as soon as possible.  The sick person also has the responsibility to seek medical help and to cooperate with medical professionals (eg, follow their treatment plan).
The passage states that the underdiagnosis of BD might be partially attributed to individuals with BD who may not realize that their manic episodes are problematic and/or seek treatment for them (Paragraph 3).  Therefore, a potential explanation for the underdiagnosis of BD, based on the information in the passage and sick role theory, is that individuals with BD fail to meet the obligations of illness (ie, seeking medical help).
(Choice A)  According to sick role theory, failure of society to exempt individuals with BD from their normal social roles violates a right of illness but does not explain why BD is so often underdiagnosed.
(Choice B)  According to sick role theory, people holding loved ones with BD accountable for their illness would violate a right of illness, but this does not explain why BD is so often underdiagnosed.
(Choice C)  The passage suggests that physicians may be too willing to grant the rights of illness to BD patients to the extent that they overdiagnose the illness, as exemplified by the physician's quote.
Educational objective:
According to sick role theory, a sick person has the right to be excused from normal responsibilities and to be held blameless for the illness.  A sick person has the obligation to attempt to get well as soon as possible, and to seek and comply with the advice of medical professionals."
546,"Which of the following symptoms, if present, would help a clinician diagnose bipolar disorder rather than borderline personality disorder?",A,84,"Bipolar disorders (BD) are characterized by mania, defined as an abnormally elevated or irritable mood and increased energy.  Manic episodes may also include feelings of grandiosity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas (rapid thoughts), and impulsive or reckless behaviors (eg, extreme spending, promiscuous sexual activity).
Most people with BD also experience depressive episodes.  Depressive episodes share the same symptoms as depressive disorder, such as feelings of sadness or hopelessness, lack of interest in activities, sleep disturbances, and frequent thoughts of death or suicide.
Borderline personality disorder is characterized by instability in mood, sense of self, and relationships.  Symptoms may include extreme mood reactivity, fear of abandonment, impulsive or reckless behavior (eg, drug use, unsafe sex), and suicidal or self-harming behavior.
Lack of interest in activities previously enjoyed is a symptom that may be present in BD and depressive disorder, but is not characteristic of borderline personality disorder; therefore, if present, this symptom would help a clinician diagnose BD rather than borderline personality disorder.
(Choice B)  Impulsive or reckless behavior is characteristic of manic episodes in BD and borderline personality disorder; therefore, if present, this symptom would not help a clinician diagnose BD rather than borderline personality disorder.
(Choice C)  Efforts to avoid being abandoned are characteristic of borderline personality disorder but not BD.
(Choice D)  Suicidal ideation (thoughts about suicide) is characteristic of BD and borderline personality disorder; therefore, if present, this symptom would not help a clinician diagnose BD rather than borderline personality disorder.
Educational objective:
Bipolar disorder is characterized by mania:  An elevated or irritable mood, feelings of grandiosity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas (rapid thoughts), and risky behaviors.  Most people with bipolar disorder also experience depressive episodes:  Feelings of sadness/hopelessness, lack of interest in activities, sleep disturbances, and thoughts of death or suicide."
547,The biomedical approach to mental illness is best demonstrated by:,B,84,"The biomedical approach to mental illness suggests that physiological causes (abnormal brain chemistry) result in psychological symptoms, and therefore medical treatment is advised to fix the underlying problem.  This approach is best demonstrated by pharmaceutical companies raising BD symptom awareness while offering new drug therapies.
The biomedical approach (also known as the biomedical model) emphasizes diagnosis (ie, disease identification based on symptoms and/or diagnostic testing) and treatment (eg, drugs, surgery).  Predominant in American medicine, this approach assumes that medical intervention can fix the problem and the patient will play a passive role in the process.
The advantages to this approach include increased life expectancy rates, demonstrated effectiveness for many illnesses, and improved quality of life for some patients, particularly those with chronic conditions who greatly benefit from drug therapy.  However, this approach is not effective for many individuals with psychological disorders.  Disadvantages of this approach include its narrow focus, which ignores other (eg, social) factors, and its reliance on drugs, many of which can produce harmful side effects.
(Choice A)  The biomedical model has been correlated with overdiagnosis of disease, partially as the result of drug companies developing and promoting the use of new therapies among the medical community and consumers.
(Choices C and D)  The biomedical model emphasizes the role of the physician and medical system in diagnosing and treating disease, and assumes that the patient will play a passive role.  Therefore, neither the failure of patients to recognize their symptoms nor proactive strategies encouraging symptom recognition align with this model.
Educational objective:
The biomedical approach to mental illness emphasizes the diagnosis of physiological causes (abnormal brain chemistry) by physicians and the treatment of symptoms using drugs.  This approach has helped many, but it has not been effective for everyone:  Its narrow focus ignores other factors related to illness, and drug treatment can produce harmful side effects."
548,What does the physician's quote in the passage best exemplify?,A,84,"Availability heuristic
Representativeness heuristic
How easily something comes to memory (eg, assuming shark attacks are common after seeing one reported on the news)
How well something matches a mental prototype (eg, assuming a woman dressed in scrubs is a nurse rather than a surgeon)
In psychology, heuristics are defined as mental shortcuts that allow for more rapid problem solving and faster decision making than algorithms (ie, step-by-step processes that guarantee a correct solution but can be time intensive).  Although faster, heuristics are often less accurate.  The two major types are the availability heuristic and the representativeness heuristic.
The availability heuristic is the tendency to make decisions or base judgments on how easily something is recalled from memory.  In other words, things that are readily available in memory are thought to be more common.  The physician's quote describing heightened exposure to the symptoms of BD leading to a propensity to overdiagnose is an example of the availability heuristic influencing a decision-making process.
The representativeness heuristic is the tendency to compare things (eg, people, events) to existing mental prototypes when making judgments.  Mental representations (eg, nurses tend to be women) may cause one to draw a conclusion that is inaccurate, such as assuming that a woman in scrubs is a nurse instead of a doctor (Choice D).
(Choice B)  Belief perseverance occurs when one refuses to be influenced in the face of convincing evidence.  In other words, the original belief is maintained despite new information to the contrary.  There is no evidence that the physician is refusing to be persuaded.
(Choice C)  The overconfidence bias occurs when one's confidence in knowledge or abilities exceeds accuracy (eg, an individual who is sure of acing a test but actually receives an average grade).  The physician does not indicate overconfidence.
Educational objective:
Heuristics are mental shortcuts that save time but are often less accurate.  The availability heuristic is the tendency to believe that if something is easily recalled from memory, it must be common.  The representativeness heuristic is the tendency to compare things (eg, people, events) to our mental prototypes when coming to conclusions."
549,Does the quote from Patient 3 reflect the sociological concept of the illness experience?,C,84,"The illness experience is a symbolic interactionist perspective that examines how individuals understand and cope with serious or chronic illnesses that impact daily life and self-identity.  The illness experience includes strategies employed by individuals who are chronically ill:
Illness work involves gathering information about one's illness, seeking treatment, taking medications, and other illness-related activities.
Everyday work involves other daily activities that do not directly involve managing one's illness but are nevertheless impacted by one's illness, such as maintaining a household, working, and caring for loved ones.
Biographical work involves making sense of the illness for oneself and for others, such as explaining the illness to coworkers, friends, and family.
Patient 3's quote discusses the emotional and practical impact of BD in terms of acknowledging one's illness and managing it through medication as well as the effect this acknowledgment has on the patient's sense of identity, all of which reflect the illness experience.
(Choice A)  The illness experience does not address unconscious desires relating to illness, and the quote does not appear to suggest this either.
(Choice B)  Stigmatization refers to the process of society labeling traits or qualities as undesirable.  Mental illness is often stigmatized, but the quote does not address the way others perceive or interact with the patient.
(Choice D)  The quote suggests that the patient's self-identity adapts to incorporate BD; however, changes to self-identity related to illness are included as part of the illness experience approach.
Educational objective:
The illness experience discusses how chronically ill individuals make sense of and manage their illness in daily life and what effect illness has on their sense of self-identity.  Chronically ill individuals employ strategies that involve illness work (eg, taking medications), everyday work (eg, maintaining a household), and biographical work (eg, explaining the illness to others) to cope with and make sense of their illness."
