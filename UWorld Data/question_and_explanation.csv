"1","The passage implies that Miller's Death of a Salesman was innovative for the era when it was first performed because:","B","1","To help dramatize Willy's psychological deterioration, Miller makes liberal use of a technique known as interior monologue….  Thus, through Willy's mutterings, we are privy to his mental state as he becomes increasingly entangled in remembrances of things past.  Eventually, the ill-fated salesman is unable to distinguish between then and now, illusion and reality.  Perhaps more impactful is Miller's corresponding tactic of time shifts: as Loman vacillates between reality and reverie, the audience is effectively shuttled between present and past. (Paragraph 2)
Miller's stratagem of mobile concurrency…is a function of the main character's desperate condition.  Willy is acutely aware of himself as an aging man for whom career opportunities have foreclosed and for whom the time to realize goals has run out.  His hypersensitive state leaves him susceptible to episodes of spontaneous recollection: a seemingly trivial occurrence summons up a similar event from the past, or a casually uttered word or phrase (for example, mention of the Lomans' old car) triggers a barrage of memories.  The recalled event, along with its contiguous incidents and attendant emotions, is pulled from the matrix of the past into the flow of the present and reexperienced. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 2 describes Miller's distinctive staging techniques.  According to the author, ""To help dramatize Willy's psychological deterioration, Miller makes liberal use of a technique known as interior monologue.""  Thus, through Willy's monologues or ""mutterings,"" Miller makes the audience ""privy to [his protagonist's] mental state as he becomes increasingly entangled in remembrances of things past"" to the point where he cannot distinguish these from reality.
Miller's ""mobile concurrences"" likewise blur time boundaries: ""as Loman vacillates (alternates) between reality and reverie (dream state), the audience is effectively shuttled between present and past.""  Although ""highly subjective,"" these time shifts represent ""intrusions of the past into the present.""
In Paragraph 3, the author explains how these mobile concurrences operate through ""episodes of spontaneous recollection"" to bring past and present together into the play's structure: ""a seemingly trivial occurrence summons up a similar event from the past, or a casually uttered word or phrase…triggers a barrage of memories.  The recalled event…is pulled from the matrix of the past into the flow of the present and reexperienced.""
Consequently, Miller used the technique of interior monologue together with his own device of mobile concurrences to integrate past events into the stream of current events being depicted in the play.  Therefore, the passage implies that Miller's Death of a Salesman was innovative for the era when it was first performed because it portrayed past and present events as intertwined.
 (Choice A)  it revived the traditional presentation of tragedy.  Paragraph 1 refers to Miller's drama as ""uniquely psychological"" in that it gives the audience access to the inside of the protagonist's mind.  The play is also described as a ""tragedy depicting the downfall of distraught salesman Willy Loman."" These descriptions indicate that although Miller's play was tragic in its scope, it was highly innovative or unique in its presentation.  Consequently, the play was not aimed at reviving the traditional presentation of tragedy (the features of which are never described in the passage).
(Choice C)  it featured a protagonist who ultimately fails.  Paragraph 3 discusses Willy Loman's status as ""an aging man for whom career opportunities have foreclosed and for whom the time to realize goals has run out.""  This information suggests that the play's main character is an ordinary person who had not met with success.  However, the passage never suggests that Miller's play was innovative for its era because it featured a protagonist who ultimately fails.
(Choice D)  it featured extensive flashback sequences.  According to Paragraph 2, Miller used a ""tactic of time shifts: as Loman vacillates between reality and reverie, the audience is effectively shuttled between present and past.""  However, these time shifts, or ""mobile concurrences,"" are ""unlike the popular cinematic device of flashbacks, which aim to recreate prior events objectively""; they instead present ""highly subjective reconstructions imparting Willy's version of those events.""  Accordingly, Miller's play did not feature extensive flashback sequences; rather, it used a similar but distinct device of mobile concurrences."
"2","The passage assertion that Death of a Salesman is ""a requiem for the American dream of material success"" (Paragraph 1) suggests that the play:","B","1","Often regarded as a requiem for the American dream of material success, Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman is one of the best-known plays of the modern American stage.  Not so well known, however, is the 1949 drama's original title, ""The Inside of His Head.""  Yet that erstwhile label may more accurately capture the spirit of this uniquely psychological tragedy depicting the downfall of distraught salesman Willy Loman. (Paragraph 1)
Willy is acutely aware of himself as an aging man for whom career opportunities have foreclosed and for whom the time to realize goals has run out. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 1 describes Death of a Salesman ""as a requiem (solemn remembrance) for the American dream of material success.""  According to the passage author, Miller's play presents ""the downfall of distraught salesman Willy Loman.""  Paragraph 3 goes on to describe Willy as ""an aging man for whom career opportunities have foreclosed and for whom the time to realize goals has run out.""  Thus, the play highlights the failure of Willy's career aspirations, emphasizing that, despite his efforts, he has been unable to achieve the success the American dream would seem to have promised.
Consequently, the passage assertion that Death of a Salesman is ""a requiem for the American dream of material success"" (Paragraph 1) suggests that the play revealed the elusiveness of the success promised by the American dream.
 By contrast, the passage assertion that Death of a Salesman is ""a requiem for the American dream of material success"" would not suggest that the play:
was originally intended to convey a political message (Choice A).  Paragraph 1 states that Miller originally titled his play ""The Inside of His Head,"" suggesting that the initial focus was on the ""uniquely psychological"" aspects of the work.  Accordingly, although the final version of the play is viewed as ""a requiem for the American dream of material success,"" the passage never indicates whether an explicitly political message was part of Miller's original intention.
endorsed the conception of material success represented by the American dream (Choice C).  Through the character of Willy, Miller suggests that the success promised by the American dream is elusive and perhaps even empty.  Despite his long-term pursuit of this dream, Willy has ended up in a ""desperate condition"": he has become ""acutely aware of himself as an aging man for whom career opportunities have foreclosed and for whom the time to realize goals has run out"" (Paragraph 3).  This negative portrait of the unfulfilled and unsuccessful protagonist conveys implicit criticism of the American dream.  Accordingly, the play challenged rather than endorsed the dream's conception of material success.
had less impact on society than the idea of the American dream (Choice D).  Although Miller's drama is described as ""one of the best-known plays of the modern American stage"" (Paragraph 1), the passage does not discuss the play's impact on society, nor does it compare this impact with that of the American dream."
"3","In Paragraph 2, the author states that, as a playwright, Arthur Miller:","D","1","To help dramatize Willy's psychological deterioration, Miller makes liberal use of a technique known as interior monologue….  [I]nterior monologue exposes the audience to the inner workings of the protagonist's mind….  Thus, through Willy's mutterings, we are privy to his mental state as he becomes increasingly entangled in remembrances of things past.  Eventually, the ill-fated salesman is unable to distinguish between then and now, illusion and reality.  Perhaps more impactful is Miller's corresponding tactic of time shifts: as Loman vacillates between reality and reverie, the audience is effectively shuttled between present and past.  However, unlike the popular cinematic device of flashbacks, which aim to recreate prior events objectively, these intrusions of the past into the present—dubbed ""mobile concurrences"" by Miller—are highly subjective reconstructions imparting Willy's version of those events. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, ""To help dramatize Willy's psychological deterioration, Miller makes liberal use of a technique known as interior monologue.""  Through this nontraditional technique, the playwright ""exposes the audience to the inner workings of the protagonist's mind.""  Furthermore, Miller uses his own innovation on ""the popular cinematic device of flashbacks,"" which he calls ""mobile concurrences.""  These mobile concurrences enable Miller to move the audience between the present and past even as Willy himself ""vacillates (alternates) between reality and reverie (dream state).""  However, ""unlike…flashbacks, which aim to recreate prior events objectively,"" mobile concurrences are described as ""highly subjective reconstructions imparting Willy's version of those events.""
Accordingly, Miller used nontraditional techniques to enable his audience to adopt Willy's personal point of view.  Therefore, in Paragraph 2, the author states that, as a playwright, Arthur Miller constructed Willy's subjective view by employing techniques that were not traditional.
 (Choice A)  downgraded the cinematic device of flashback.  In Paragraph 2, the author distinguishes Miller's mobile concurrences from ""the popular cinematic device of flashbacks.""  Whereas flashbacks ""aim to recreate prior events objectively,"" the playwright's mobile concurrences ""are highly subjective reconstructions imparting Willy's version of those events.""  Consequently, Miller transformed the flashback into a subjective device by shaping the presentation of past events from his character's point of view.  However, the passage author neither evaluates Miller's modification as negative nor characterizes it as downgrading.
(Choice B)  dramatized events from the past in ways that tend to obscure Willy's perspective. According to Paragraph 2, ""To help dramatize Willy's psychological deterioration, Miller makes liberal use of a technique known as interior monologue.""  This technique ""exposes the audience to the inner workings of the protagonist's mind,"" giving them direct access to his ""mental state"" or subjective view.  Thus, the author indicates that Miller dramatized past events in ways that tend to bring Willy's perspective into focus for the audience rather than obscuring it.
(Choice C)  dramatized his protagonist's decline through speech that is confusing to the audience.  Paragraph 2 indicates that Miller dramatized his protagonist's decline through the technique of interior monologue or speech that ""exposes…the inner workings"" of a character's mind.  Accordingly, ""through Willy's mutterings (ie, monologues or speech), we are privy to his mental state as he becomes increasingly entangled in remembrances of things past.""  However, even though Miller's protagonist expresses his state of mental confusion through his dramatized speech, Paragraph 2 does not indicate that the audience is confused by it."
"4","The passage author suggests that the presentation of Willy's inner thoughts:","B","1","To help dramatize Willy's psychological deterioration, Miller makes liberal use of a technique known as interior monologue.  Like stream of consciousness, which delivers a character's unfiltered and uncontrolled thoughts in all their incoherence, interior monologue exposes the audience to the inner workings of the protagonist's mind, only using slightly more verbal organization.  Thus, through Willy's mutterings, we are privy to his mental state as he becomes increasingly entangled in remembrances of things past. (Paragraph 2)
In the play, Miller presents Willy's inner thoughts through a technique he called interior monologue.  As Paragraph 2 explains, ""Like stream of consciousness, which delivers a character's unfiltered and uncontrolled thoughts in all their incoherence, interior monologue exposes the audience to the inner workings of the protagonist's mind, only using slightly more verbal organization.""  Accordingly, interior monologue allows all the contents of a character's mind to emerge freely without being censored in any way.  Therefore, the passage author suggests that the presentation of Willy's inner thoughts transmits his impressions indiscriminately.
 (Choices A and C)  conveys solely what Willy chooses to reveal; and it is mediated and restricted.  Paragraph 2 describes interior monologue, the technique Miller uses to present Willy's inner thoughts: ""Like stream of consciousness, which delivers a character's unfiltered and uncontrolled thoughts in all their incoherence, interior monologue exposes the audience to the inner workings of the protagonist's mind, only using slightly more verbal organization.""  Consequently, the playwright aimed to present all the thoughts of his character, not just those thoughts Willy might choose to reveal.  In addition, as Willy's inner thoughts are provided in their ""unfiltered and uncontrolled"" state, their presentation is not mediated and restricted.
(Choice D)  it constitutes a linear progression of ideas.  Paragraph 2 describes the thoughts conveyed by stream of consciousness and by the similar technique of interior monologue as ""unfiltered and uncontrolled,"" adding that they are presented ""in all their incoherence.""  Accordingly, the presentation of Willy's inner thoughts would include involuntary, random, and even irrational thoughts; hence, it would most likely not constitute a linear progression of ideas."
"5","The success ascribed to Miller in Paragraph 5 is based on his ability to portray:","C","1","Through the techniques of interior monologue and mobile concurrences, Miller manipulates the temporal structure of his drama depicting the American dream's demise.  By making time's boundaries permeable for the broken and nostalgic Willy, Miller allows past and present to coexist for the audience as well.  Thus, the playwright succeeds at giving us his protagonist's subjective view—the view, that is, from the inside of his head (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, ""Through the techniques of interior monologue and mobile concurrences, Miller manipulates the temporal structure of his drama.""  The dramatist thereby enables his audience to share Willy's perception of the past and the present as existing simultaneously.  Hence, as the passage author concludes, ""the playwright succeeds at giving us his protagonist's subjective view—the view, that is, from the inside of his head."" Consequently, the success ascribed to Miller in Paragraph 5 is based on his ability to portray Willy's distinct perspective.
 By contrast, the success Paragraph 5 ascribes to Miller is not based on his ability to portray:
Willy's devastation by the American dream (Choice A).  Paragraph 3 describes Willy Loman as ""acutely aware of himself as an aging man for whom career opportunities have foreclosed and for whom the time to realize goals has run out.""  Hence, this character's ""desperate condition"" derives from the sense that he has failed to achieve the American dream.  In Paragraph 5, the author reinforces Willy's devastation by referring to him as ""broken.""  However, the author does not attribute the success Miller had in presenting his protagonist's subjective view as depending upon the playwright's ability to portray Willy in a specific state, namely, as devastated by the American dream.
nostalgia for America's past (Choice B).  As Paragraph 4 notes, Willy often lapses into ""a romanticized past,"" losing himself in nostalgic daydreams of times gone by.""  Accordingly, as presented by Miller, Willy's subjective view is often tinged with nostalgia, or feelings of longing for the past.  However, the actual dramatic techniques Miller uses to enable him to present Willy's (nostalgic) view (ie, interior monologue and mobile concurrences) do not depend on expressing nostalgia either for a personal past or for America's past.
an unbiased frame of reference (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 5, ""Miller manipulates the drama's temporal structure"" and ""[b]y making time's boundaries permeable…allows past and present to coexist"" not only for Willy, but for the audience.  Paragraph 5 then implies that Miller's success results from presenting to the audience ""his protagonist's subjective view—the view, that is, from the inside of his head.""  This subjective point of view constitutes a biased rather than an unbiased frame of reference."
"6","Passage information suggests that Colin Prior's mistaken assumption about the keys worn by Turkana females was based on his:
somewhat insufficient understanding of Blumer's principle.
somewhat insufficient training as a cultural researcher.
somewhat excessive attempt to avoid ethnocentrism.","B","2","Research into other cultures has long been informed by the recognition that one must attempt to assimilate the viewpoint of the group under study, rather than proceed from ethnocentric conceptions. (Paragraph 1)
However, a peculiar sort of danger can arise from adherence to this clearly reasonable principle, as illustrated in the recent experience of anthropological photographer Colin Prior.  While studying the Turkana tribe of northwest Kenya, Prior…approached a group of girls: ""In my naïveté, I asked the purpose of the keys worn around the girls' necks.  Their bemused reply was as much a surprise to me as the question had been a surprise to them.  'For our front doors.'"" (Paragraph 2)
…with the Turkana he appears to have assumed that the obvious answer must not be right.  Paradoxically, Prior's openness to discovering the differences of another society led him away from, rather than toward, a correct understanding. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 1, to effectively research other cultures one ""must attempt to assimilate the viewpoint of the group under study, rather than proceed from ethnocentric conceptions.""  Nevertheless, Paragraph 2 conveys that this principle can be taken too far, ""as illustrated in the recent experience of anthropological photographer Colin Prior.""  Curious about the keys worn by Turkana females, Prior asked what their purpose was, only to receive the ""'bemused reply'"" that the keys were ""'[f]or our front doors.'""
Paragraph 3 suggests that if Prior had been in a more familiar context, he ""would have thought the function of the keys was obvious.""  However, because he was so focused on how Turkana culture might differ from his own, he instead ""appears to have assumed that the obvious answer must not be right,"" and thus that the girls' keys must have some other purpose than the straightforward one of opening their doors.  Ironically, then, his commitment to assimilating the viewpoint of another culture ""led him away from, rather than toward, a correct understanding.""
Accordingly, passage information suggests that Prior's mistaken assumption about the keys worn by Turkana females was based on his somewhat excessive attempt to avoid ethnocentrism (Number III).
 (Number I)  somewhat insufficient understanding of Blumer's principle.  Paragraph 1 cites Herbert Blumer's observation that ""'people act toward things on the basis of the meaning that these things have for them, not on the basis of the meaning that these things have for the outside scholar.'""  However, Paragraph 2 then warns that ""a peculiar sort of danger can arise from adherence to this clearly reasonable principle, as illustrated in the recent experience of anthropological photographer Colin Prior.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that Prior was following Blumer's principle by not assuming that keys had the same meaning for the Turkana as they did for himself.  Thus, the passage does not suggest that Prior had an insufficient understanding of Blumer's principle.
(Number II)  somewhat insufficient training as a cultural researcher.  According to Paragraph 1, cultural researchers should be careful ""not to import…the presuppositions of their own backgrounds into their understanding of another culture or tradition.""  The author refers to this idea as a ""clearly reasonable principle"" (Paragraph 2), despite noting in Paragraph 3 that in Prior's case, it ""[p]aradoxically…led him away from, rather than toward, a correct understanding.""  Therefore, although Prior did make a mistaken assumption, he was still following a generally applicable principle of cultural research; the passage never suggests that Prior's mistake was the result of insufficient training as a cultural researcher."
"7","Which of the following passage assertions is NOT supported by evidence in the passage?","D","2","A mirror image of Prior's experience can be found among girls of another Kenyan tribe, the Samburu.  Noting the rarity of formal education among Samburu women, Carolyn Lesorogol describes the uneducated females' ""incomprehension of what the [educated] girls did in school.  One woman commented that, as a child, she was at a loss to understand why the one school girl sat in her house looking at a paper (i.e. reading).  When the other girls asked her to join them outside to play or go to a dance, she refused, saying she wanted to stay in and look at the paper."" (Paragraph 4)
For those who are literate, the sheer automaticity of the act of reading makes it difficult to imagine the confusion the woman felt as a child.  But to someone for whom even the concept of reading is unfamiliar, the school girl's actions would surely have seemed bizarre; presumably just sitting and staring at a piece of paper would indeed be quite boring. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 4 describes the experience of a Samburu woman who grew up without any formal education.  Because such education was a ""rarity…among Samburu women,"" she and her peers were baffled by the behavior of a girl who did attend school.  In particular, the woman had no concept of literacy, remarking that ""'as a child, she was at a loss to understand why the one school girl sat in her house looking at a paper (i.e. reading).'""
The author then remarks in Paragraph 5 that ""[f]or those who are literate, the sheer automaticity of the act of reading makes it difficult to imagine the confusion the woman felt as a child.""  However, the author never elaborates on why the automaticity of reading would make the woman's confusion difficult to imagine.  For instance, they do not cite any studies about literate people's perceptions of illiteracy, nor contrast the Samburu woman's experience with that of a child raised in a literate culture.
Accordingly, the passage assertion about the difficulty of imagining the Samburu woman's confusion is not supported by evidence in the passage.
 (Choice A)  ""Presumably in the latter case Prior would have thought the function of the keys was obvious, but with the Turkana he appears to have assumed that the obvious answer must not be right.""  In recounting his conversation with the Turkana girls, Prior claimed: ""'In my naïveté, I asked the purpose of the keys worn around the girls' necks.  Their bemused reply was…""For our front doors""'"" (Paragraph 2).  By describing himself as naïve for asking about the keys, Prior implies that he should have guessed the answer without needing to ask.  Unlocking doors is a common and obvious function of keys, and Prior's self-criticism in the face of the girls' ""bemused reply"" highlights this fact.  Therefore, the assertion that Prior simply assumed that the obvious answer must not be right is supported by passage evidence.
(Choice B)  ""Research into other cultures has long been informed by the recognition that one must attempt to assimilate the viewpoint of the group under study, rather than proceeding from ethnocentric conceptions.""  In Paragraph 1 the author cites ""1969's influential Symbolic Interactionism,"" in which Herbert Blumer wrote that ""'people act toward things on the basis of the meaning that these things have for them, not on the basis of the meaning that these things have for the outside scholar.'""  Accordingly, the information that this idea was expressed in an influential work published decades ago supports the passage assertion that ""[r]esearch into other cultures has long been informed"" by such a recognition.
(Choice C)  Samburu women displayed ""'incomprehension of what the [educated] girls did in school.'""  Paragraph 4 discusses ""the rarity of formal education among Samburu women,"" including the women's ""'incomprehension of what the [educated] girls did in school.'""  This incomprehension is then evidenced by the specific example of a woman who ""'commented that, as a child, she was at a loss to understand why the one school girl sat in her house looking at a paper (i.e. reading).'"""
"8","Based on the passage, the childhood perspective of the Samburu woman toward the school girl in her village is most similar to the perspective of:","D","2","Noting the rarity of formal education among Samburu women, Carolyn Lesorogol describes the uneducated females' ""incomprehension of what the [educated] girls did in school.  One woman commented that, as a child, she was at a loss to understand why the one school girl sat in her house looking at a paper (i.e. reading).  When the other girls asked her to join them outside to play or go to a dance, she refused, saying she wanted to stay in and look at the paper."" (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, most Samburu women do not receive a formal education.  Thus, one woman described the confusion she felt as a child, when ""'she was at a loss to understand why the one school girl sat in her house looking at a paper (i.e. reading).'""  In other words, she could observe the school girl's actions but could not understand the meaning behind those actions, perceiving them as ""looking at a paper"" instead of interpreting them as ""reading.""
Likewise, if a foreign traveler viewed a religious ceremony she had never seen before, she would observe various actions being performed as part of that ceremony.  However, she would not understand the meaning behind those actions.  For example, although she might see a person making specific movements, she would lack comprehension of the spiritual or symbolic significance of this behavior.  Therefore, the childhood perspective of the Samburu woman toward the school girl in her village is most similar to the perspective of a foreign traveler encountering an unfamiliar religious ceremony.
 (Choice A)  a sheltered student meeting diverse groups of people in college.  Paragraph 4 describes ""the one school girl [who] sat in her house looking at a paper (i.e. reading).""  Accordingly, the Samburu woman encountered only a single person representing a diverse viewpoint, rather than diverse groups of people.  Moreover, the fact that there was only one school girl suggests that the Samburu woman had not been sheltered but was merely like the overwhelming majority of people in her community.
(Choices B and C)  a community leader shunning a social transgressor; and an outsider seeking acceptance from an in-group.  According to Paragraph 4, ""the other girls asked [the school girl] to join them outside to play or go to a dance.""  Therefore, the passage does not indicate that the group of girls shunned the school girl, but rather states that they attempted to include her in their activities.  Similarly, the passage does not portray the Samburu woman as an outsider seeking acceptance, but instead depicts her as being like most of the other girls."
"9","Which of the following beliefs best exemplifies the ""assumption of a deeper-level similarity underlying the surface-level differences"" between cultures referred to in the passage?","D","2","Nevertheless, diversity among peoples with regard to dress, family structure, gender, religious practices, and so on reflects a variety of answers to what are universal questions about human needs.  Thus, the foundation of understanding a culture other than one's own must still include the assumption of a deeper-level similarity underlying the surface-level differences. (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 6, ""diversity among peoples with regard to dress, family structure, gender, religious practices, and so on reflects a variety of answers to what are universal questions about human needs.""  Thus, the author asserts that people share common needs for human life and well-being, underneath the differences that exist between societies in terms of particular customs and traditions.  Therefore, the author concludes that ""the foundation of understanding a culture other than one's own must still include the assumption of a deeper-level similarity underlying the surface-level differences.""
Similarly, the belief that sentences from one language can in principle be translated into any other implies that the different languages refer to ideas that are common to all humans.  Such a belief would depend on the assumption that although diverse languages contain ""surface-level"" differences of words, those words are different ways of referring to the same ""deeper-level"" concepts.  Consequently, this belief about translation best exemplifies the ""assumption of a deeper-level similarity underlying the surface-level differences"" between cultures (Paragraph 6).
 By contrast, the ""assumption of a deeper-level similarity underlying the surface-level differences"" between cultures is not best exemplified by:
the belief that leaders from one nation should be respected by those of other nations (Choice A).  The idea that leaders from one nation should be respected by the leaders of other nations does not necessarily suggest anything about cultural similarity.  For example, one could believe that other leaders should be respected as a matter of practical policy, without assuming that there is a ""deeper-level similarity"" (Paragraph 6) between another culture and one's own.
the belief that children from one society can easily adapt to life in a new one (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 6, differences between societies constitute ""a variety of answers to what are universal questions about human needs.""  However, even if these questions are universal, that does not necessarily mean that it is easy for children (or anyone) to adapt to another society's ""answers.""  Moreover, customs and behaviors related to ""dress, family structure, gender, religious practices, and so on"" are likely to be strongly ingrained as part of one's way of life, suggesting that changing them would tend to be difficult.
the belief that food from one region is typically similar to that of its geographic neighbors (Choice C).  Food similarities among people in geographically neighboring regions would be based on factors such as local wildlife, climate, and agricultural conditions.  Thus, beliefs about such similarities would not depend on any assumptions about societies' cultural practices."
"10","The passage author's central point in discussing the examples of the Turkana and Samburu tribes is that those who research other cultures should:","B","2","Those who research other peoples are thus generally well served by the admonition not to import (whether overtly or subconsciously) the presuppositions of their own backgrounds into their understanding of another culture or tradition. (Paragraph 1)
However, a peculiar sort of danger can arise from adherence to this clearly reasonable principle, as illustrated in the recent experience of anthropological photographer Colin Prior. (Paragraph 2)
Paradoxically, Prior's openness to discovering the differences of another society led him away from, rather than toward, a correct understanding. (Paragraph 3)
One woman commented that, as a child, she was at a loss to understand why the one school girl sat in her house looking at a paper (i.e. reading).  When the other girls asked her to join them outside to play or go to a dance, she refused, saying she wanted to stay in and look at the paper."" (Paragraph 4)
For those who are literate, the sheer automaticity of the act of reading makes it difficult to imagine the confusion the woman felt as a child.  But to someone for whom even the concept of reading is unfamiliar, the school girl's actions would surely have seemed bizarre; presumably just sitting and staring at a piece of paper would indeed be quite boring. (Paragraph 5)
The passage discusses two problematic extremes of cultural research: the overestimation of differences between groups, and the inability to adopt another perspective.  First, while the author warns scholars ""not to import…the presuppositions of their own backgrounds into their understanding of another culture or tradition"" (Paragraph 1), they also note that ""a peculiar sort of danger can arise from adherence to this clearly reasonable principle"" (Paragraph 2).  For instance, Colin Prior was so open to the possibility that Turkana culture differed from his own that his outlook ""[p]aradoxically…led him away from, rather than toward, a correct understanding"" (Paragraph 3).
Second, the author discusses the other end of the spectrum, where one is unable to see past one's own ideas and perceptions.  For example, Paragraph 4 describes a Samburu woman who had no concept of reading, only of ""looking at a paper.""  In Paragraph 5, the author points out that ""[f]or those who are literate, the sheer automaticity of the act of reading makes it difficult to imagine the confusion the woman felt as a child.""  However, they stress the importance of interpreting the behavior from the Samburu woman's standpoint, explaining that ""to someone for whom even the concept of reading is unfamiliar, the school girl's actions would surely have seemed bizarre.""
Accordingly, the passage author argues that cultural research can go astray both from being excessively open-minded and from being excessively narrow-minded.  Consequently, their central point in discussing the examples of the Turkana and Samburu tribes is that those who research other cultures should strike a balance between intellectual openness and rigid thinking.
 By contrast, the passage author's central point in discussing the examples of the Turkana and Samburu tribes is not that those who research other cultures should:
keep in mind the cultural effects caused by a society's level of literacy (Choice A).  In Paragraph 5, the author contrasts the perspectives of ""those who are literate"" and ""someone for whom even the concept of reading is unfamiliar.""  However, while this contrast relates to the author's discussion of the Samburu, they never discuss literacy in relation to the Turkana.  Moreover, the author draws on these examples to make a more comprehensive point about two pitfalls of cultural research.
be receptive to the idea that obvious interpretations may not be correct (Choice C).  Paragraph 3 conveys that Prior made a mistake about the Turkana girls' keys because ""he appears to have assumed that the obvious answer must not be right.""  In this way, his extreme ""openness to discovering the differences of another society led him away from, rather than toward, a correct understanding.""  Accordingly, the author makes the point that in some cases, obvious interpretations really are correct.
avoid closed-mindedness in interpreting cultural practices (Choice D).  Although the author indicates that cultural researchers must avoid ""proceed[ing] from ethnocentric conceptions"" (Paragraph 1), rigid thinking is only one of two extremes that they identify as problematic."
"11","The passage suggests that the most interesting feature of the Lascaux caves is:","B","3","In September 1940, near the tiny village of Montignac in the southwest region of France, a band of four youths and a dog accidentally stumbled upon the opening to a series of underground caverns whose walls were covered with prehistoric paintings.  Their monumental discovery unleashed a mystery that has continued to puzzle scholars: What function did these magnificent caves perform for the society that painted them?  One plausible theory, yet unproven, is that they constituted a kind of sacred space, perhaps a site for religious ceremonies. (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, the ""monumental discovery"" of the caves ""unleashed a mystery that has continued to puzzle scholars,"" namely, ""What function did these magnificent caves perform for the society that painted them?""  Much of the passage then focuses on the possibility that the caves ""constituted a kind of sacred space, perhaps a site for religious ceremonies"" and on the initiation rites that may have taken place there.  This emphasis on the mysterious function of the caves indicates that their possible purpose is their most interesting feature.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 1 says: ""One plausible theory, yet unproven, is that [the caves] constituted a kind of sacred space, perhaps a site for religious ceremonies.""  Paragraph 4 adds that ""countless footprints shown to have belonged to adolescent male suggest that the caves hosted initiation rituals.""  Consequently, whether the caves actually served as sites for initiation rites is a matter of ongoing speculation in the passage rather than an actual feature of the caves.
(Choices C and D)  Paragraph 3 states that ""[a]pproximately 900"" of the Lascaux paintings depict animals associated with the hunt, such as ""horses, bison, stags, large felines, and hares,"" and that ""[v]arious pigments, mainly red, yellow, and brown were used"" by the Lascaux artists to paint the images on the cave walls.  Although both the depiction of the hunt and the use of colorful pigments are definite features of the caves, they are secondary to the feature that is primary or most interesting in the passage, namely, the possible purpose the caves served for the society that painted them."
"12","According to the passage, the initiation rites of the hunter-gatherer society are based on the assumption that:
hunting occupies a prominent place within the community.
adolescent males are of particular concern to the older males.
adolescent males are naïve and inexperienced.","D","3","More than 2,000 paintings and symbols [were found]….  Approximately 900 of these depict horses, bison, stags, large felines, and hares, clearly reflecting a society of hunter-gatherers. (Paragraph 3)
Moreover, countless footprints…suggest that the caves may have hosted initiation rituals marking a boy's passage from childhood to maturity.  At this critical juncture, the youths would have traditionally been separated from their families by the adult males and put through frightening ordeals….  The purpose of such traumas was to prepare the adolescent for the physical and psychological rigors of the hunt, the brutalities of warfare, and the inevitable trials of adulthood. (Paragraph 4)
When illuminated against the blackness, the realistic murals would have become a moving spectacle that simulated the hunt, the wonder and gravity of which was forever imprinted upon the boys' psyches. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 3 states that ""[a]pproximately 900"" of the Lascaux paintings ""depict horses, bison, stags, large felines, and hares, clearly reflecting a society of hunter-gatherers.""  Paragraph 5 adds that the initiation rites had the effect of turning ""the realistic murals"" into ""a moving spectacle that simulated the hunt, the wonder and gravity of which was forever imprinted upon the boys' psyches.""  Based on this passage information, it can be assumed that the hunt was extremely important to the people of Lascaux and so occupies a prominent position within that community (Number I).
Paragraph 4 describes how ""the youths would have traditionally been separated from their families by the adult males and put through frightening ordeals.""  This indicates that within the society the older males had an important role to play opposite the young boys: They were responsible for putting them through the ordeals of their initiation process that prepared them for adult life and the hunt.  Therefore, it can be assumed that adolescent males are of particular concern to the older males of the society (Number II).
Paragraph 4 describes the initiation rites as ""marking a boy's rite of passage from childhood to maturity"" when ""the youths would have traditionally been separated from their families by the adult males and put through frightening ordeals.""  The purpose of these ordeals was ""to prepare the adolescent for the physical and psychological rigors of the hunt, the brutalities of warfare, and the inevitable trials of adulthood.""  From this description it can be assumed that the boys being initiated need to learn about their role in society as well as the hunt and so are naïve and inexperienced (Number III)."
"13","The author of the passage is primarily attempting to explain the:","D","3","Their monumental discovery unleashed a mystery that has continued to puzzle scholars: What function did these magnificent caves perform for the society that painted them?  One plausible theory, yet unproven, is that they constituted a kind of sacred space, perhaps a site for religious ceremonies. (Paragraph 1)
The paintings date from between 17,000 and 12,000 BCE, which places them within the Upper Paleolithic era. (Paragraph 2)
Nevertheless, the cave art of Lascaux suggests a purpose that goes beyond artistic expression. (Paragraph 3)
It is likely these chambers served as a sanctuary within which the paintings would have corresponded to the iconography of a temple.  Moreover, countless footprints shown to have belonged to adolescent males suggests that the caves may have hosted initiation rituals marking a boy's passage from childhood to maturity. (Paragraph 4)
In asking, ""What function did these magnificent caves perform for the society that painted them?"" (Paragraph 1), the author establishes an anthropological viewpoint, one that looks at a human culture and its practices.  The author then speculates about the ""mystery"" of these caves as it relates to the practices of this society, which would have flourished somewhere ""between 17,000 to 12,000 BCE"" (Paragraph 2).  For instance, Paragraph 3 says ""the cave art of Lascaux suggests a purpose that goes beyond artistic expression.""  Paragraph 4 adds that ""[i]t is likely these chambers served as a sanctuary…[and] countless footprints shown to have belonged to adolescent males suggest that the caves may have hosted initiation rituals.""
Accordingly, the passage author is primarily attempting to explain the practices of a prehistoric culture (ie, society) from an anthropological viewpoint.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 4 presents the initiation rites as ""triggering 'a regressive disorganization of the personality' followed by 'a constructive reorganization' of the individual's faculties…meant to force the youth to call upon inner resources…thereby inducing a kind of psychological death and rebirth.""  However, the passage author does not focus primarily on attempting to explain the transition from adolescence to maturity from a psychological viewpoint (one that considers mental and emotional states), but rather on explaining the possible purpose of the Lascaux caves.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 5 states that ""descending into the darkness of the caves must have seemed like immersing oneself in what religious historian Mircea Eliade has termed 'sacred time,' a kind of dissociative (detached) state conducive (favorable) to the deeply transformative experience of the initiate.""  However, although the passage author suggests that the initiates may have experienced ""sacred time,"" he or she never attempts to explain the essential meaning of the initiation rites from a religious viewpoint (one involving the sacred or divine).
(Choice C)  The Lascaux caves displayed paintings of ""horses, bison, stags, large felines, and hares"" (Paragraph 3), which became ""a moving spectacle that simulated the hunt, the wonder and gravity of which was forever imprinted upon the boys' psyches"" (Paragraph 5).  Although this evidence indicates a relationship between humans and animals in the society, and mythologist Joseph Campbell's visit to Lascaux is mentioned, the author never attempts to explain this relationship from a mythological viewpoint (one based on traditional stories or myths)."
"14","If the author were to claim that the initiation rites described in Paragraph 4 served as an effective means for the adolescent boys to mature, the evidence provided for such an inference would be:","A","3","At this critical juncture, youths would have traditionally been separated from their families by the adult males and put through frightening ordeals.  The boys might have been tattooed, confined, or presented with physical challenges.  The purpose of such traumas was to prepare the adolescent for the physical and psychological rigors of the hunt, the brutalities of warfare, and the inevitable trials of adulthood.  Theologian Karen Armstrong describes such experiences as triggering ""a regressive disorganization of the personality"" followed by a ""constructive reorganization"" of the individual's faculties.  In other words, the rites were meant to force the youth to call upon inner resources of which he was not yet aware, thereby inducing a kind of psychological death and rebirth. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, ""[t]he purpose"" of the ""traumas"" caused by the initiation rites ""was to prepare the adolescent for the physical and psychological rigors of the hunt, the brutalities of warfare, and the inevitable trials of adulthood.""  Such experiences are further described as ""triggering 'a regressive disorganization of the personality' followed by 'a reconstructive reorganization' of the individual's faculties.""  The rites would ""force the youth to call upon inner resources of which he was not yet aware, thereby inducing a kind of psychological death and rebirth.""
Although this evidence would imply that the initiation rites were designed to stimulate the maturation of these adolescent boys, the passage provides no examples that initiation did, in fact, lead to maturity.  As a result, the evidence that the rites were an effective means for helping the boys mature is weak.
(Choice B)  According to Paragraph 4, ""the youths would have traditionally been separated from their families by the adult males and put through frightening ordeals"" in which they ""might have been tattooed, confined, or presented with physical challenges.""  Paragraph 5 further states that in the darkness of the caves ""all normal orientation"" was ""suspended.""  This evidence would seem to imply that being frightened and disoriented was an essential part of the adolescent initiation rites.  However, the passage does not reveal whether the boys remained frightened and disoriented after the rites or whether they recovered and matured as a result.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 4 says, ""At this critical juncture, the youths would have traditionally been separated from their families by the adult males and put through frightening ordeals.""  This statement indicates that the elders in the society supervised, or at least played a strong role in, the initiation of the boys.  However, the passage never indicates that this supervision by the male elders ensured the boys' maturation.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 5 says that ""[i]n primitive societies, descending into the darkness of the caves must have seemed like immersing oneself in what religious historian Mircea Eliade has termed 'sacred time,' a kind of dissociative (detached) state conducive (favorable) to the deeply transformative experience of the initiate.""  However, this statement represents a comparison made by the author; the passage never establishes that the adolescent boys being initiated at Lascaux experienced sacred time during the rites and matured as a result."
"15","Suppose that animal images painted on the flat surfaces of the cave seemed to move quickly when the initiates viewed them.  This information would most strongly oppose the passage claim that using the ""edges and curvatures"" of the cave wall:","D","3","More than 2,000 paintings and symbols cover the insides of the caverns.  Approximately 900 of these depict horses, bison, stags, large felines, and hares, clearly reflecting a society of hunter-gatherers.  Various pigments, mainly red, yellow, and brown, were used.  By employing a novel method that took advantage of the edges and curvatures of the cave walls, the artists were able to give lifelike dimensions to these images as well as endow them with a sense of motion. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, ""[b]y employing a novel method that took advantage of the edges and curvatures of the cave walls, the [Lascaux] artists were able to give lifelike dimensions to these [animal] images as well as endow (provide) them with a sense of motion.""  This implies that it was essential for the artists to use the ""edges and curvatures"" of the cave walls to create dimension and ""a sense of motion"" (ie, movement) in the images.
However, if animal images painted on the flat surfaces of the cave appeared to move quickly when the initiates viewed them, this would imply that it was not essential to use the ""edges and curvatures"" of the cave walls to give these images the appearance of being in motion.  In fact, the illusion of movement could be created by some other technique.  Therefore, the appearance of motion in figures painted on the flat surfaces would strongly oppose the passage claim that using the ""edges and curvatures"" of the cave walls was essential for the artists to be ""able to"" create the illusion of movement.
(Choices A and C)  Paragraph 3 states that using ""the edges and curvatures of the cave walls"" produced images with ""lifelike dimensions.""  Accordingly, the passage is claiming that the images painted on the ""edges and curvatures"" of the cave walls are more realistic (ie, ""lifelike"") and have well-defined shape and appearance of mass (ie, ""dimensions"").  However, if initiates perceived images painted on the flat surfaces of the cave walls to be moving, this appearance of movement would be irrelevant to any claims about the realistic appearance or the dimensions of images painted on the cave walls' edges and curvatures.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 3 states that ""[b]y employing a novel method that took advantage of the edges and curvatures of the cave walls, the artists were able to give lifelike dimensions to these images as well as endow them with a sense of motion.""  However, even if the illusion of motion could also be achieved on a flat surface, this would constitute a different technique, separate from the innovative method used on non-flat surfaces.  Therefore, if images painted on the flat surfaces appeared to move, this would not oppose the claim that the Lascaux artists employed an innovative technique in taking advantage of the cave walls' edges and curvatures."
"16","Based on the author's description of adolescent initiation, which of the following assertions could most reasonably be inferred about the hunter-gatherer society described in the passage?","C","3","Moreover, countless footprints shown to have belonged to adolescent males suggest that the caves may have hosted the initiation rituals marking a boy's passage from childhood to maturity.  At this critical juncture, the youths would have traditionally been separated from their families by the adult males and put through frightening ordeals.  The boys might have been tattooed, confined, or presented with physical challenges.  The purpose of such traumas was to prepare the adolescent for the physical and psychological rigors of the hunt, the brutalities of warfare, and the inevitable trials of adulthood. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 states that the adolescent boys ""would have traditionally been separated from their families by the adult males and put through frightening ordeals.""  This indicates that the initiation rites consisted of established practices that were presumably handed down from one generation to the next and were meant ""to prepare the adolescent for the physical and psychological rigors of the hunt.""  Therefore, it can most reasonably be inferred that the rituals would have been based on long-established values such as beliefs about the importance of the hunt.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 4 states that ""the youths would have traditionally been separated from their families by the adult males and put through frightening ordeals.""  Therefore, adolescent initiation is not shown to be a voluntary process in the passage but rather an involuntary one, since it is imposed by the society for its own benefit and not chosen by the individual.
(Choice B)  According to Paragraph 4, ""[t]he purpose of such traumas was to prepare the adolescent for the physical and psychological rigors of the hunt, the brutalities of warfare, and the inevitable trials of adulthood.""  This demonstrates that the initiation rites were about preparing adolescents for their new adult role and integrating them into adult society.  Consequently, such ceremonies are meant to support rather than challenge societal expectations.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 4 indicates that ""traumas"" helped ""to prepare the adolescent for the physical and psychological rigors of the hunt, the brutalities of warfare, and the inevitable trials of adulthood.""  In addition, Paragraph 4 cites Karen Armstrong's description of such experiences ""as triggering 'a regressive disorganization of the personality' followed by 'a constructive reorganization' of the individual's faculties.""  As the passage explains, the trauma involved in the rites helped ""to force the youth to call upon inner resources of which he was not yet aware, thereby inducing a kind of psychological death and rebirth.""  Accordingly, trauma would not inhibit but facilitate the maturation process of the adolescents."
"17","A triple-decker pulpit in an eighteenth-century church would most likely have been viewed in which of the following ways?","D","4","[H]istorical websites laud [Christ Church] as ""an extraordinary example of eighteenth-century architecture, featuring meticulous brickwork, vaulted ceilings, and gorgeous compass-headed windows.""  Notably, the church also contains a triple-decker pulpit—a rare but distinctive feature of its era. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 conveys how historical websites have held up Christ Church as ""'an extraordinary example of eighteenth-century architecture,'"" emphasizing that this church ""also contains a triple-decker pulpit—a rare but distinctive feature of its era.""  By describing this kind of pulpit as rare and noteworthy, the passage suggests that it would have been an uncommon and attention-drawing feature even in a church of that time period.  Accordingly, a triple-decker pulpit in an eighteenth-century church would most likely have been viewed as an object of curiosity.
 (Choice A)  as an impractical innovation.  Paragraph 1 stresses that the triple-decker pulpit was ""a rare but distinctive feature of its era"" (ie, the eighteenth century).  However, the passage never discusses the practicality of triple-decker pulpits or of eighteenth-century church architecture in general.
(Choice B)  as a result of the Carter family's influence.  The original Christ Church building was ""commissioned in 1665 by John Carter,"" whose grandsons oversaw its transformation into ""'the most finely crafted Anglican parish church in all of colonial Virginia'"" (Paragraph 1).  However, while the Carters were specifically responsible for building Christ Church, the passage does not indicate that the family took measures to have any other churches built or that any of them used their influence to have triple-decker pulpits installed in churches.  Accordingly, the passage never suggests that a triple-decker pulpit in an eighteenth-century church would have been viewed as a sign of the Carter family's influence.
(Choice C)  as an unremarkable phenomenon.  As Paragraph 1 reports, Christ Church ""[n]otably…contains a triple-decker pulpit—a rare but distinctive feature of its era.""  Accordingly, since triple-decker pulpits were rare even in an eighteenth-century church, the presence of such a pulpit would most likely have been viewed as nothing other than a remarkable phenomenon."
"18","The passage comparison of Christ Church with the ancient temple of Apollo at Bassae is most likely intended to establish:","B","4","…Christ Church constitutes an architectural feat of mathematical precision in harmony with nature's laws.  Indeed, horologist H. Stephen Stewart has characterized it as ""a building of numbers""—specifically, calendric, solar, and lunar numbers….  [T]wo weeks after the vernal equinox…a sunbeam…rests upon the altar; this phenomenon repeats itself two weeks prior to the autumnal equinox.  Moreover, a shadow cast from a cornice of the building…tracks the progression from spring to fall.  For eight hours daily, the structure also acts as a sundial…. (Paragraph 2)
The locale and physical orientation of this sacred structure were critical: not just any terrestrial site could offer complete celestial alignment.  As a result, Christ Church has basked in splendid isolation amidst an untamed countryside in a spot described…as ""a rather lonely one, with woods all around, few or no houses near, and no good roads.""  Its exchange of geographical remoteness for astronomical positioning recalls another singular sanctuary, the fifth-century BCE Temple to Apollo, the god of the sun and rationality, at Bassae in Greece.  Thrust deep into the rural expanse, this imposing temple—whose design has been attributed to the same architect as the Athenian Parthenon—sits atop Kotylion Mountain.  There, this previously forgotten structure holds dominion over a desolate landscape through which, prior to the last century, no truly passable road led.  Oriented north to south rather than (the more typical) east to west, the building seems calibrated to track the sun's annual phases.  Like the church, the temple has moved from dilapidation to restoration, becoming the focus of scrutiny as scientists decipher the calculus of its blueprint. (Paragraph 3)
As Paragraph 2 explains, Christ Church is ""an architectural feat of mathematical precision in harmony with nature's laws"" and uniquely designed to track the yearly movements of the sun.  For example, ""a shadow cast from a cornice…tracks the progression from spring to fall,"" while ""[f]or eight hours daily, the structure also acts as a sundial.""
Paragraph 3 then emphasizes how ""[t]he locale and physical orientation"" of the church's building were crucial for achieving ""complete celestial alignment,"" enabling the structure to track the phases of the sun.  Notably, achieving such precise alignment resulted in the church's ""geographical remoteness,"" reminiscent of the isolated fifth-century BCE Temple to Apollo at Bassae.  This temple is also comparable to the church as ""[o]riented north to south rather than (the more typical) east to west, the building seems calibrated to track the sun's annual phases.""
Consequently, the passage comparison of Christ Church with an ancient temple of Apollo is most likely intended to establish that each structure incorporated architectural calibrations based on solar movements.
 (Choice A)  that each structure was designed with the purpose of geographical isolation.  While both the church and the temple are known for their ""geographical remoteness,"" the passage stresses how their sites were carefully selected to offer ""complete celestial alignment"" (Paragraph 3).  The precise location and ""astronomical positioning"" of Christ Church enable it to track the sun's yearly and daily cycles.  Likewise, due to its location and how it is ""[o]riented north to south rather than (the more typical) east to west,"" the temple at Bassae can track the sun's annual phases.  Therefore, each structure was precisely aligned and deliberately designed to track the sun; the consequence of this alignment was geographical isolation.
(Choice C)  that ancient temples were more attuned to celestial phenomena than modern houses of worship.  According to Paragraph 2, Christ Church represents ""an architectural feat of mathematical precision in harmony with nature's laws,"" allowing it to track solar cycles.  Likewise, as Paragraph 3 indicates, the ancient Temple of Apollo at Bassae is ""[o]riented north to south rather than (the more typical) east to west,"" enabling it to track the sun's yearly phases.  Thus, the passage depicts each structure as attuned to celestial phenomena; however, it never describes the temple as being more attuned than either Christ Church or modern houses of worship.
(Choice D)  that the church was a typical example of Enlightenment-era architecture whereas the temple's physical orientation was uncommon.  Paragraph 1 describes Christ Church as ""'an extraordinary example of eighteenth-century architecture.'""  By contrast, Paragraph 3 describes the temple at Bassae as uncommon among such ancient Greek temples in being ""[o]riented north to south rather than (the more typical) east to west.""  However, the author also emphasizes how both houses of worship were purposely positioned to track the solar cycle.  Accordingly, the passage comparison of Christ Church with the ancient temple is most likely intended to establish that each structure was precisely located to achieve ""complete celestial alignment"" (Paragraph 3)."
"19","Based on Paragraph 1, which of the following statements best describes an assumption made by the author?","B","4","Situated near Weems, Virginia, Christ Church has long belied its appearance as a typical, if elite, Anglican house of worship from the colonial era.  Some have conjectured that the 1735 building is based on a prototype by the renowned English architect Christopher Wren, and, in truth, its resemblance to Farley Church in Wiltshire, England, which he designed, is almost uncanny. (Paragraph 1)
In Paragraph 1, the author makes the following comment regarding Christ Church: ""Some have conjectured that the 1735 building is based on a prototype by the renowned English architect Christopher Wren, and, in truth, its resemblance to Farley Church in Wiltshire, England, which he designed, is almost uncanny.""  With this statement the author does not indicate that they themselves believe that Christ Church was designed by Wren, or even based on one of his blueprints.  However, the author seems to assume that the almost disturbing resemblance of the church building to a genuine Wren church means it was likely inspired by a Wren creation.  Therefore, based on Paragraph 1, an assumption made the author is that the architecture of Christ Church was likely inspired by the work of Christopher Wren.
 By contrast, none of the following statements describes an assumption made by the author:
The most finely crafted Anglican churches of the eighteenth century were in Virginia (Choice A).  In Paragraph 1, the author refers to Christ Church as ""'the most finely crafted Anglican parish church in all of colonial Virginia.'""  However, the author never mentions any other eighteenth-century Anglican churches in Virginia, nor compares such Virginian churches with those outside the state.
Christopher Wren was the most prolific architect of colonial America (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 1, ""Some have conjectured that the 1735 building is based on a prototype by the renowned English architect Christopher Wren""; as the author points out, ""its resemblance to Farley Church in Wiltshire, England, which he designed, is almost uncanny.""  However, the author provides no information to suggest that Wren ever designed any other buildings in the US and certainly never suggests that Wren was the most prolific architect in colonial America.
The Carters were the most religious family in colonial Virginia (Choice D).  In Paragraph 1, the author reports how the wealthy Carter family had been responsible for the construction of Christ Church, which would eventually be considered ""'the most finely crafted Anglican parish church in all of colonial Virginia.'""  However, while such an achievement shows that the Carters were dedicated to constructing an impressive church, without more information this fact is insufficient to establish whether they were more or less religious than other families in the area.  Therefore, the author does not necessarily assume that the Carters were the most religious family in colonial Virginia."
"20","According to the passage, the timekeeping functions of the church's architecture suggest:","D","4","The intricacies of this remarkable building point to its duality in being not only a religious sanctuary, but a shrine to rationality, a veritable temple of the Enlightenment.  Beneath its surface, Christ Church constitutes an architectural feat of mathematical precision in harmony with nature's laws.  Indeed, horologist H. Stephen Stewart has characterized it as ""a building of numbers""—specifically, calendric, solar, and lunar numbers. (Paragraph 2)
Clearly, such anomalies were not the result of happenstance.  As spaces of worship, these shrines are at once pragmatic and sacred: their purposes overtly divine even as their designs honor nature and extol reason. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 2 presents the architecture of Christ Church as based on rational principles, emphasizing how its structure represents ""an architectural feat of mathematical precision in harmony with nature's laws.""  The author also conveys horologist (ie, specialist in time measurement) H. Stephen Stewart's characterization of this church as ""'a building of numbers'—specifically, calendric, solar, and lunar numbers""—exemplified through its remarkable timekeeping capabilities.  Later, Paragraph 4 describes how ""[a]s spaces of worship,"" both Christ Church and the Temple of Apollo at Bassae are ""at once pragmatic (practical) and sacred.""  Likewise, the purpose of both buildings is ""overtly (openly) divine even as their designs honor nature and extol (praise) reason.""
Thus, Christ Church is primarily a religious sanctuary, but one that was also purposely constructed to incorporate rational principles based on the laws of nature in the form of celestial calibrations.  Accordingly, the timekeeping functions of the church's architecture suggest an attempt to harmonize supernatural beliefs with the principles of reasoning.
 (Choices A and B)  the widespread correlation of architectural designs with the phases of the solar cycle; and a fundamental need for religious sites to align with astronomical coordinates.  Paragraph 2 refers to Christ Church as a ""remarkable building,"" precisely positioned and constructed to use the solar cycles to tell time.  Similarly, Paragraph 3 emphasizes how by being ""[o]riented north to south rather than (the more typical) east to west,"" the Temple of Apollo at Bassae tracks the sun's annual phases.  Accordingly, the architectural designs of both buildings were intended to correspond with the solar cycle; however, the passage also indicates that their locations were precisely calculated and stresses the extraordinary nature of each building.  In Paragraph 4, the author conveys that the solar-tracking features of these two astronomically aligned sanctuaries are ""anomalies"" (outside the norm) and ""not the result of happenstance.""  Thus, the solar-tracking functions of the church's architecture suggest neither a widespread correlation of architectural designs with the phases of the solar cycle nor a fundamental need for religious sites to align with astronomical coordinates.
(Choice C)  a reaction to a disconnection between nature and religion in modern times.  According to Paragraph 4, the church's space was built to be ""at once pragmatic and sacred"" with a purpose that is ""overtly divine,"" even as the building's design with its remarkable timekeeping functions ""honor[s] nature and extol[s] reason.""  However, the passage never suggests that such harmonizing of natural laws with the divine was a reaction to a disconnection between nature and religion in modern times."
"21","By referring to Christ Church as ""a time machine"" in Paragraph 2, Stewart implies that the church has the capacity to:","C","4","Beneath its surface, Christ Church constitutes an architectural feat of mathematical precision in harmony with nature's laws.  Indeed, horologist H. Stephen Stewart has characterized it as ""a building of numbers""—specifically, calendric, solar, and lunar numbers.  As Stewart explains, two weeks after the vernal equinox, on the mean date for Easter, a sunbeam shines through the oval window above the main entrance that faces due west and rests upon the altar; this phenomenon repeats itself two weeks prior to the autumnal equinox.  Moreover, a shadow cast from a cornice of the building…tracks the progression from spring to fall.  For eight hours daily, the structure also acts as a sundial, casting its shadow on the north lawn.  A seemingly multifunctional edifice, Christ Church, as Stewart astutely concluded, is a virtual ""time machine."" (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 conveys horologist (ie, specialist in time measurement) H. Stephen Stewart's characterization of Christ Church as ""'a building of numbers'—specifically, calendric, solar, and lunar numbers.""  The passage then reports how the church is designed to track the sun's cycles.  For instance, ""a shadow cast from a cornice…tracks the progression from spring to fall,"" and ""[f]or eight hours daily, the structure also acts as a sundial.""
Paragraph 2 then provides Stewart's conclusion: the church with its perfect celestial alignment and many solar tracking functions is basically an oversized timekeeping device, or as he says, a ""'time machine.'""  Thus, in referring to Christ Church as a ""'time machine,'"" Stewart implies that it has the capacity to measure the elapse between key celestial phenomena.
 (Choices A)  elevate the temporal aspects of phenomena over the divine.  In Paragraph 2, the author provides Stewart's assessment of Christ Church as ""'a building of numbers'—specifically, calendric, solar, and lunar numbers.""  The church's hidden functions as calendar and clock—or its ability to track the phases of the sun and act as a sundial—are then detailed, before relaying Stewart's conclusion that the building constitutes a kind of ""'time machine.'""  Although Stewart does highlight the church's capacity to mark and measure time, he never goes on to suggest that it has the capacity to elevate the temporal aspects of phenomena over the divine aspects.
(Choices B)  partially replace worshippers' reliance on the clock and the calendar.  Paragraph 2 details Christ Church's timekeeping capabilities, for instance, how ""a shadow cast from a cornice…tracks the progression from spring to fall,"" and ""[f]or eight hours daily, the structure also acts as a sundial.""  However, the passage never indicates that churchgoers are aware of or could make any practical use of those timekeeping functions.  Consequently, by calling the church ""'a time machine,'"" Stewart is not implying that it has the capacity to partially replace worshippers' reliance on standard timekeeping tools.
(Choice D)  make churchgoers feel as though they are in the eighteenth century.  Paragraph 1 cites how Christ Church is ""'an extraordinary example of eighteenth-century architecture.'""  However, when Stewart characterizes this building as a ""'time machine'"" in Paragraph 2, his concern is not with historical time but with timekeeping.  As a horologist he notes how the church is ""'a building of numbers'—specifically, calendric, solar, and lunar numbers""—with the ability to track the solar movements; for instance, ""a shadow cast from a cornice to the building…tracks the progression from spring to fall.""  Accordingly, although Christ Church bears the marks of being constructed in the 1700s, by calling it a time machine Stewart does not imply that it has the capacity to make churchgoers feel as though they are in the eighteenth century."
"22","Given the information in the passage, the author would most likely say that the best art:","C","5","To modern ears, this Greek conception of propriety must sound absurd or even humorous.  Nevertheless, it exemplifies the effect of cultural contact in challenging a society's values, whether through direct observation of a practice or mediated through the art that displays it.  Of course, that function of art also operates within a society, and this self-reflection and critique of cultural ethos is one of art's most important functions.  This is not necessarily to say that art must offer such a challenge to be great; indeed, there are many works that have extraordinary aesthetic worth simply for what they represent.  Still, the importance of art in posing difficult, even painful, questions cannot be overstated. (Paragraph 2)
In Paragraph 2, the author discusses criteria that give a work of art importance or worth.  First, the author highlights the use of art in ""challenging a society's values,"" adding that the ""self-reflection and critique of cultural ethos (ie, a culture's commonly held moral assumptions) is one of art's most important functions.""  Hence, the author conveys that a crucial purpose of art is to question beliefs that a society takes for granted.
However, the author then asserts that some works may be highly valuable even if they do not question a society's values: ""This is not necessarily to say that art must offer such a challenge to be great; indeed, there are many works that have extraordinary aesthetic worth simply for what they represent.""  Thus, the author indicates that the aesthetic excellence of an artwork (ie, its beauty or skillfulness) may also be a strong source of artistic value.
Therefore, the author's view is that the best works of art pose an important challenge to society's values, or skillfully portray beauty.  In other words, he or she would most likely say that the best art serves to exemplify beauty or question assumptions.
  (Choice A)  must ignore societal norms about what is considered decent.  Paragraph 4 asserts that ""much of what modern viewers take for granted would seem indecent to viewers of the past.""  However, this is simply a descriptive claim about perceptions of decency changing over time; the author never argues that the best art must ignore norms of decency.  Rather, he or she implies that art should either exemplify or challenge those norms by portraying ""life as it is"" or ""life as it ought to be.""
(Choice B)  must be found in media other than television.  Paragraph 3 mentions the ""truly bizarre"" aspect of early television in which most fictional programs depicted ""pairs of twin beds where the husbands and wives slept separately.""  In Paragraph 4, the author suggests that, because this broadcasting standard ""represented neither life as it is nor life as it ought to be,"" such shows may ""simply fail to constitute art.""  However, the author makes this suggestion specifically about ""most shows of the 1950s and 1960s"" (Paragraph 3).  He or she never makes a broader claim that all television fails to be art or that the best art can only be found in other forms of media.
(Choice D)  must succeed in expressing a society's values.  In Paragraph 2, the author asserts that ""challenging a society's values…is one of art's most important functions.""  Similarly, Paragraph 3 implies that art should either ""reflect [or] challenge the values of its time.""  Therefore, the author would not say that the best art must express a society's values.  In his or her view, at least some of the best works of art serve to question those values."
"23","Implicit in the author's discussion of television standards (Paragraph 4) is the idea that:","B","5","This television standard is hard to understand, in part because the implicit moral claims involved do not exemplify the kinds of cultural differences described above….  Nor can the standard be easily attributed to attitudes evolving over time; although much of what modern viewers take for granted would seem indecent to viewers of the past, surely the idea of a married couple occupying the same bed does not fall into that category.  Thus, the prohibition against depicting that practice could only have ""protected"" audiences from something wholly uncontroversial.  As such, this aspect of early television programming represented neither life as it is nor life as it ought to be—nor even how anyone thought life ought to be.  In this respect, then, does it simply fail to constitute art? (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 discusses an aspect of 1950s and 1960s television that is ""hard to understand,"" in which married couples were typically depicted as sleeping in separate beds.  According to the author, this standard for television programming ""represented neither life as it is nor life as it ought to be—nor even how anyone thought life ought to be.""  As a result, he or she asks: ""In this respect, then, does [early television] simply fail to constitute art?""
By posing this question, the author implies that an essential quality of art is to bear some connection to a society's accepted values.  In this context, depicting ""life as it is"" would affirm how married couples actually behave, while depicting ""life as it ought to be"" would portray a view about how married couples should behave.  More generally, then, the author conveys that for a work to qualify as art, it must either affirm or question what a society takes for granted.  Therefore, implicit in the author's discussion of television standards (Paragraph 4) is the idea that a work must either reflect societal values or challenge them in order to count as art.
  By contrast, none of the following ideas are implicit in the author's discussion of television standards:
standards are important for shielding viewers from offensive content (Choice A).  The author criticizes early television's prohibition against showing ""a married couple occupying the same bed,"" asserting that it ""could only have 'protected' audiences from something wholly uncontroversial"" (Paragraph 4).  In other words, he or she argues that this particular standard did not relate to anything offensive in the first place.  The author never makes a general claim about whether such standards are important.
the effects of watching television are similar to those of encountering art from another culture (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 4, ""The American audiences of American television were not another society at risk of being shocked and frightened by unfamiliar customs, as the Greeks experienced with the Etruscans.""  Therefore, the author describes a scenario in which watching television is different than encountering art from another culture; he or she never suggests that those activities are similar.
censoring how common behaviors are depicted should be considered wrong rather than moral (Choice D).  The author is critical of the particular television standard under discussion, stating that it is ""hard to understand"" the prohibition against depicting ""a married couple occupying the same bed"" (Paragraph 4).  However, although the author mentions the ""implicit moral claims"" assumed to motivate that standard, he or she never discusses whether, in general, prohibitions against depicting certain behaviors should be seen as right or wrong."
"24","Which of the following statements is most supported by evidence or examples in the passage?","A","5","Art has always been an expression of values: from the earliest cave paintings to modern abstract sculpture, works of art are physical embodiments of a people's mores, experiences, and assumptions….  For instance, pre-Roman Etruscan art evinces a surprising level of freedom for women relative to other societies.  The Cerveteri Sarcophagus includes a sculpture of a husband and wife reclining and eating together; similarly, a mural adorning the Tomb of Leopards displays several married couples dining in this fashion at a banquet.  To the ancient Greeks, however, this Etruscan practice was an unthinkable scandal: as one historian points out, ""It was so foreign to the Greeks that it both shocked and frightened them."" (Paragraph 1)
In Paragraph 1, the author draws a connection between art and values.  For instance, art from the ancient Etruscan culture ""evinces (makes evident) a surprising level of freedom for women relative to other societies.""  The author notes two works of art, ""the Cerveteri Sarcophagus"" and ""the Tomb of Leopards,"" both of which depict Etruscan women publicly dining with their husbands.  The values displayed in these artworks are then contrasted with those of the Greeks; they were ""'shocked and frightened'"" by the Etruscan practice, which would have been ""an unthinkable scandal"" in ancient Greece.
Accordingly, the Etruscan artworks embodied some of the values and activities of that ancient society.  Therefore, the author provides these examples in support of the claim that ""works of art are physical embodiments of a people's mores, experiences, and assumptions"" (Paragraph 1).
  By contrast, none of the following statements are strongly supported by evidence or examples in the passage:
""The American audiences of American television were not another society at risk of being shocked and frightened from unfamiliar customs, as the Greeks experienced with the Etruscans"" (Choice B).  By emphasizing that the audiences of American television were Americans, the author treats it as self-evident that such audiences did not constitute a separate society.  He or she provides no additional evidence or examples to support this claim.
""[M]uch of what modern viewers take for granted would seem indecent to viewers of the past"" (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 4, ""[A]lthough much of what modern viewers take for granted would seem indecent to viewers of the past, surely the idea of a married couple occupying the same bed does not fall into that category.""  Therefore, the author provides an example of something that would not seem indecent to viewers of the past.  He or she provides no examples of anything that past viewers would find indecent.
""To modern ears, this Greek conception of propriety must sound absurd or even humorous"" (Choice D).  Paragraph 1 conveys that at public dinners in ancient Greece, ""the only women who attended were servants and paid companions; the men's wives 'remained at home, excluded from most aspects of public life.'""  Although the passage states that this fact ""must sound absurd or even humorous"" to modern readers (Paragraph 2), the author provides no evidence or examples to support this claim about modern readers' attitudes.  Rather, he or she seems to simply assume such readers' agreement."
"25","What does the passage imply about works of art that do not reflect a society's character?","C","5","To modern ears, this Greek conception of propriety must sound absurd or even humorous.  Nevertheless, it exemplifies the effect of cultural contact in challenging a society's values, whether through direct observation of a practice or mediated through the art that displays it.  Of course, that function of art also operates within a society, and this self-reflection and critique of cultural ethos is one of art's most important functions.  This is not necessarily to say that art must offer such a challenge to be great; indeed, there are many works that have extraordinary aesthetic worth simply for what they represent.  Still, the importance of art in posing difficult, even painful, questions cannot be overstated. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 highlights the importance of art in ""challenging a society's values.""  This process can occur between societies as an ""effect of cultural contact,"" in which one group's ideas influence and potentially alter another's.  In addition, the same phenomenon occurs within a given culture.  In the author's view, ""this self-reflection and critique of cultural ethos (ie, a culture's commonly held moral assumptions) is one of art's most important functions.""  The author then emphasizes this claim even further, asserting that ""the importance of art in posing difficult, even painful, questions cannot be overstated.""
Accordingly, the passage implies that works of art that do not reflect a society's character tend to question and challenge the character of that society.  In other words, such works typically function to critique accepted ideas.
  (Choice A)  Such works are typically misunderstood.  The passage describes how works of art can challenge a society's values, but it never discusses such works being misunderstood.  For instance, Paragraph 1 describes how a practice illustrated in Etruscan art ""was an unthinkable scandal"" to the ancient Greeks.  However, that does not mean that the Greeks were confused about the meaning of such art, only that they did not share the value that the art conveyed.  Likewise, by claiming that a ""television standard [from the 1950s and 1960s] is hard to understand"" (Paragraph 3), the author implies that the standard served little purpose, not that the television shows themselves were misunderstood.
(Choice B)  They generally reveal the influence of another society.  According to Paragraph 1, some Etruscan artworks depict a practice that was common in that society but would have been ""an unthinkable scandal"" in ancient Greece.  This example illustrates the author's general point about ""the effect of cultural contact in challenging a society's values"" (Paragraph 2).  However, the author asserts that the process of challenging values ""also operates within a society, and this self-reflection and critique of cultural ethos is one of art's most important functions.""  Therefore, although art that challenges a society's values might reveal another society's influence, the passage never suggests that this is the most typical scenario.
(Choice D)  Such works generally reveal the artist's aspirations.  According to Paragraph 2, works of art that do not reflect a society's character can lead to ""self-reflection and critique of cultural ethos.""  Thus, the author discusses the effects of such works on a society.  However, the author never discusses the aspirations of artists, nor suggests that those aspirations are generally revealed in works of art that challenge a society's values."
"26","Which of the following statements best describes the central thesis of the passage?","D","5","Art has always been an expression of values: from the earliest cave paintings to modern abstract sculpture, works of art are physical embodiments of a people's mores, experiences, and assumptions….  For instance, pre-Roman Etruscan art…includes a sculpture of a husband and wife reclining and eating together; similarly, a mural adorning the Tomb of Leopards displays several married couples dining in this fashion at a banquet.  To the ancient Greeks, however, this Etruscan practice was an unthinkable scandal: as one historian points out, ""It was so foreign to the Greeks that it both shocked and frightened them."" (Paragraph 1)
Of course, that function of art also operates within a society, and this self-reflection and critique of cultural ethos is one of art's most important functions.  This is not necessarily to say that art must offer such a challenge to be great; indeed, there are many works that have extraordinary aesthetic worth simply for what they represent.  Still, the importance of art in posing difficult, even painful, questions cannot be overstated. (Paragraph 2)
What is truly bizarre, however, is when art seems neither to reflect nor to challenge the values of its time.  It might be wondered how such a scenario would be possible, as any depiction that did not reflect a society's character would at least suggest a tension with it. (Paragraph 3)
As such, this aspect of early television programming represented neither life as it is nor life as it ought to be—nor even how anyone thought life ought to be.  In this respect, then, does it simply fail to constitute art? (Paragraph 4)
The major theme throughout the passage is the connection between art and the values that people hold.  For instance, Paragraph 1 begins by stating that ""[a]rt has always been an expression of values,"" and that ""works of art are physical embodiments of a people's mores, experiences, and assumptions.""  This point is exemplified in the fact that a common practice illustrated in Etruscan art represented ""an unthinkable scandal"" to the ancient Greeks, illustrating the different moral beliefs of the two cultures.
Paragraph 2 expands on these ideas by emphasizing the importance of art in challenging such beliefs.  In the author's view, ""this self-reflection and critique of cultural ethos (ie, a culture's commonly held moral assumptions) is one of art's most important functions,"" and ""the importance of art in posing difficult, even painful, questions cannot be overstated.""
Likewise, Paragraphs 3 and 4 further stress the close relationship between art and values.  For example, Paragraph 3 suggests that all art should either ""reflect [or] challenge the values of its time.""  Paragraph 4 then makes the stronger claim that either affirming or challenging a moral value may actually be part of the definition of art.  According to the author, a work which represents neither ""life as it is"" nor ""life as it ought to be"" might ""simply fail to constitute art"" entirely.
Therefore, the statement that the existence of art is essentially intertwined with moral ideas and concerns best describes the central thesis of the passage.
  By contrast, none of the following statements best describes the central thesis of the passage:
Studies of ancient art reveal various social and religious differences among civilizations (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 1, ""The study of [works of art] thus provides not only insight into the societies that create them, but comparative grounds for exploring cultural differences among their contemporaries.""  However, art's illustration of differences between societies is only one part of the broader passage theme that art and value are essentially connected.  Moreover, there is no specific mention of religion in the passage.
Art is the source of much conflict both within and between societies (Choice B).  Paragraph 2 describes ""the effect of cultural contact in challenging a society's values,"" as well as a similar process that ""operates within a society…[producing] self-reflection and critique of cultural ethos.""  However, even if ""conflict"" is taken to refer specifically to a clash of ideas, this claim represents only one component of the passage discussion.  The author's larger purpose in the passage is to explore the conceptual relationship between art and the expression of values.
Art can be clearly distinguished from non-art (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 5, ""[I]t may be useful to conceive of art and non-art less as distinct categories, and more as points along a continuum.""  Therefore, the author suggests that art and non-art may be more like ends of a spectrum than a strict duality; hence, art cannot always be clearly distinguished from non-art."
"27","What is the author's attitude toward the condemnation of Elvis' dance moves in the 1950s?","A","6","Historically, a connection between human dance and courtship has also been assumed, and often cautioned against.  For instance, in the 1950s Elvis was denounced by parents as a corrupting influence upon the young women who swooned over him, and some of his dance moves were censored.  People today likewise voice concerns with regard to the behavior of crowds in nightclubs and explicit lyrics in popular music.  A similar outcry will undoubtedly be heard in the future, as the struggle of parental restraint against youthful vigor continues. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 mentions concerns that are sometimes raised about the moral effects of dancing, as ""a connection between human dance and courtship has also been assumed, and often cautioned against.""  As an example, the author points out that ""in the 1950s Elvis was denounced by parents as a corrupting influence upon the young women who swooned over him, and some of his dance moves were censored.""
However, the author does not suggest that this type of concern about dancing was limited to the 1950s.  Rather, he or she describes it as both still common and expected to continue: ""People today likewise voice concerns with regard to the behavior of crowds in nightclubs and explicit lyrics in popular music.  A similar outcry will undoubtedly be heard in the future, as the struggle of parental restraint against youthful vigor continues"" (Paragraph 4).
Accordingly, the author does not express any judgment about the outcry over Elvis' dance moves.  Rather, he or she describes it impartially, suggesting that this clash between ""parental restraint"" and ""youthful vigor"" is a typical example of a recurring social phenomenon.  Therefore, the author's attitude toward the condemnation of Elvis' dance moves in the 1950s is objective, as the societal concerns about dancing are described but not evaluated.
 (Choice B)  Approving, as society is expected to have similar concerns about dancing in the future.  According to Paragraph 4, Elvis' dance moves were condemned in the 1950s because of their ""corrupting influence.""  However, although the author asserts that ""[a] similar outcry will undoubtedly be heard in the future,"" he or she does not express an approving (or disapproving) attitude toward this possibility.  Rather, the author suggests that both such a future outcry and the past condemnation of Elvis' dancing are part of a common societal conflict, ""as the struggle of parental restraint against youthful vigor continues.""
(Choice C)  Surprised, as dancing is generally accepted with socially approved couplings.  The author notes that while some kinds of dancing have been denounced, others have been generally accepted.  According to Paragraph 5, ""It should not be thought…that all amorous dancing is subject to condemnation.  Weddings include dance as a matter of custom, suggesting a long-standing endorsement within socially approved couplings.""  However, the author never suggests that this fact makes the condemnation of Elvis' dance moves surprising.  Rather, by asserting that ""a similar outcry will undoubtedly be heard in the future"" (Paragraph 4), the author implies that he or she views such condemnation as part of a predictable conflict that arises in society.
(Choice D)  Amused, as today's dancing would seem much more shocking to 1950s society.  From today's perspective, it may seem likely that the ""behavior of crowds in nightclubs and explicit lyrics in popular music"" would have been especially shocking to people in the 1950s (Paragraph 4).  However, the author never makes such a comparison in the passage, nor suggests that this idea makes it amusing that Elvis's dancing was condemned."
"28","Which of the following activities would the author most likely say involves a form of dance?","C","6","Even with non-vocal communication such as sign language, the types of bodily movements are qualitatively different from those used in dance, as dance movements signify at most a general feeling or impression rather than corresponding to specific words or ideas. (Paragraph 3)
Nevertheless, such a connection is clearly not the whole story.  One of the most fundamental uses of dance is the physical expression of music—a language not of words, but emotion. (Paragraph 5)
If music expresses emotion and dance expresses music, then, do we dance not only ""for joy"" but for all emotions? (Paragraph 6)
In the final two paragraphs, the author stresses the close connection between music and dance.  For instance, Paragraph 5 states that ""[o]ne of the most fundamental uses of dance is the physical expression of music,"" and Paragraph 6 adds that ""music expresses emotion and dance expresses music.""  Thus, the author describes expressing music as a characteristic function of dancing.  However, he or she also distinguishes dancing from other types of physical movements, stating that ""dance movements signify at most a general feeling or impression rather than corresponding to specific words or ideas"" (Paragraph 3).
Accordingly, marching band performances in which members walk in arranged formations would best fit the author's description of dancing.  Such performances coordinate physical movements with the playing of the music, thereby incorporating those movements into how the music is expressed.  Therefore, the author would most likely say that this activity involves a form of dance.
 By contrast, the author would most likely not say that any of the following activities involve a form of dance, because these types of movements are meant to convey specific words or ideas:
Martial arts demonstrations that illustrate the moves from a battle (Choice A).  By illustrating the moves from a battle, the demonstration would convey specific ideas (ie, which actions took place and the sequence in which they occurred).
Sailors' flag signals that provide directions to an approaching ship (Choice B).  By providing directions to the approaching ship, sailors' movements would constitute specific ideas (ie, instructions on how the approach should proceed).
Games of charades in which movie titles are guessed from a player's gestures (Choice D).  The gestures involved in the game of charades would be meant to convey specific words (ie, the titles of movies) to teammates."
"29","The ideas in the passage would be most relevant to the work of:","A","6","People sometimes dance for joy, or report that they are so happy that they could dance for joy.  However, one might wonder why this is so.  What is it about happiness that would lead someone to dance?  What exactly is dancing, when one ponders this activity that might otherwise be taken for granted? (Paragraph 1)
Might this similarity bespeak a common evolutionary basis for the dance of humans and other animals?  Perhaps, although there are differences which cast doubt on that hypothesis….  If the bee's dance functions like human sign language (albeit in a much less sophisticated form), it is probably not an appropriate analogue to human dance at all; the term ""dance"" would be simply a weak metaphor. (Paragraph 3)
Through social tradition or natural instinct, dance seems linked with romance in the human mind.  Nevertheless, such a connection is clearly not the whole story.  One of the most fundamental uses of dance is the physical expression of music—a language not of words, but emotion. (Paragraph 5)
If music expresses emotion and dance expresses music, then, do we dance not only ""for joy"" but for all emotions?  Seemingly not, but why?....  Is dance then truly an entity unto itself?  Or, is it merely one instance of a wider class of physical behaviors? (Paragraph 6)
The passage is largely contemplative in nature, as the author reflects about dancing as a phenomenon in human life.  For instance, Paragraph 1 begins by asking why people ""dance for joy,"" and what human dance actually is ""when one ponders this activity that might otherwise be taken for granted.""  The author also wonders about the similarities and differences between human and animal dancing, such as whether there is ""a common evolutionary basis"" for those activities and whether a bee's dance is ""an appropriate analogue to human dance at all"" (Paragraph 3).
The author similarly considers further aspects of dance, including how it ""seems linked with romance in the human mind,"" and the way it functions as ""the physical expression of music"" (Paragraph 5).  He or she ends by revisiting questions about dancing ""'for joy,'"" and asking whether dance is ""truly an entity unto itself"" (Paragraph 6).
Therefore, the focus of the passage is to explore and speculate about how dance relates to human minds, emotions, and society.  Consequently, the ideas in the passage would be most relevant to the work of a philosopher examining human nature.
 By contrast, the ideas in the passage would be less relevant to the work of:
a zoologist studying animal behavior (Choice B).  The passage does discuss some instances of animal behavior, such as how ""bees dance to provide information to other colony members"" (Paragraph 2), and how ""[m]any animals perform courtship displays…to win the favor of a potential mate"" (Paragraph 4).  However, these ideas are mainly used in the passage as a way to further explore the nature of human dance.  For instance, the author suggests that a bee's dance ""is not the same sort of thing as human dance"" (Paragraph 3), and discusses the ethical concerns surrounding the assumed ""connection between human dance and courtship"" (Paragraph 4).
a choreographer designing a routine (Choice C).  The passage raises conceptual questions about dancing, such as why people ""dance for joy"" (Paragraph 1) or how dancing ""seems linked with romance in the human mind"" (Paragraph 5).  However, it does not discuss how dances are created, nor other issues relating to dance as a profession.  Therefore, although the ideas in the passage might be of general interest to a choreographer, they would probably not be directly relevant to designing dance routines.
a historian describing changes across generations (Choice D).  The author describes how ""Elvis was denounced by parents as a corrupting influence"" in the 1950s, situating this conflict within a generational ""struggle of parental restraint against youthful vigor"" (Paragraph 4).  However, this discussion is only one component among others explored in the passage.  For example, the motivations for dancing, the contrasts between human and animal dances, and other aspects of dance relating to human nature are also discussed."
"30","Which of the following publications would most undermine the author's claims in the passage?","D","6","Indeed, some animals do seem to dance, although their reasons for doing so are goal-based.  For instance, bees dance to provide information to other colony members, using complicated movements to describe the location and quality of a food source. (Paragraph 2)
Might this similarity bespeak a common evolutionary basis for the dance of humans and other animals?  Perhaps, although there are differences which cast doubt on that hypothesis.  A bee's dance is its main method of communication, whereas most human communication is vocal….  Thus, if the bee's dance is a type of language, it is not the same sort of thing as human dance. (Paragraph 3)
In exploring the phenomenon of human dancing, the author draws a contrast to the kinds of dances performed by animals.  For example, Paragraph 2 states that ""bees dance to provide information to other colony members, using complicated movements to describe the location and quality of a food source.""  The author claims that human dancing functions much differently, in part because ""[a] bee's dance is its main method of communication, whereas most human communication is vocal"" (Paragraph 3).
Accordingly, part of the author's discussion of human dancing is based on the idea that, unlike animals such as bees, humans communicate primarily through spoken language.  Therefore, the author's claims in the passage would be most undermined by an analysis stating that most human communication is non-verbal.
 By contrast, none of the following publications would undermine the author's claims in the passage:
A study refuting the idea that bee communication depends on odors (Choice A).  Refuting this idea would be consistent with the passage claim that bees use ""complicated movements (ie, not odors) to describe the location and quality of a food source"" (Paragraph 2).
An editorial debating whether dancing is appropriate at social events for high schoolers (Choice B).  Paragraph 4 suggests that such debates have been common, as ""[h]istorically, a connection between human dance and courtship has also been assumed, and often cautioned against.""  Similarly, the author implies that parents have always been concerned about how dancing affects children, ""as the struggle of parental restraint against youthful vigor continues.""
An article describing a historical trend for societies to dance more frequently when populations decline (Choice C).  The passage never discusses a relationship between population levels and the frequency of dancing.  Hence, this trend would be irrelevant to the author's claims in the passage."
"31","Which of the following conclusions is most consistent with passage information?","B","6","People sometimes dance for joy, or report that they are so happy that they could dance for joy.  However, one might wonder why this is so. (Paragraph 1)
If music expresses emotion and dance expresses music, then, do we dance not only ""for joy"" but for all emotions?  Seemingly not, but why?  Certainly, music itself conveys a wide spectrum of feelings.  Although we do not dance ""for sadness"" or ""for anger,"" we do droop our bodies or clench our fists, and perhaps more subtle emotions produce other physical markers.  Still, happiness too can be seen in a smile, and to actually dance for joy is comparatively rare.  Is dance then truly an entity unto itself?  Or, is it merely one instance of a wider class of physical behaviors? (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 6 situates dancing within a larger context of emotive behaviors in humans.  For instance, in discussing why humans dance ""'for joy'"" but not for other emotions, the author states: ""Although we do not dance 'for sadness' or 'for anger,' we do droop our bodies or clench our fists, and perhaps more subtle emotions produce other physical markers.""  Similarly, the passage further notes that ""happiness too can be seen in a smile, and to actually dance for joy is comparatively rare.""  These remarks suggest that humans not only ""sometimes dance for joy"" (Paragraph 1), but that they generally use their bodies to express various emotions non-verbally.
Accordingly, the author ends the passage by asking rhetorically: ""Is dance then truly an entity unto itself?  Or, is it merely one instance of a wider class of physical behaviors?"" (Paragraph 6).  Therefore, the conclusion most consistent with passage information would be that dance is a subset of a more general set of emotive behaviors in human beings.
 (Choice A)  The phrase ""dance for joy"" is a phenomenon of language that does not describe actual behavior.  Paragraph 1 states that ""[p]eople sometimes dance for joy, or report that they are so happy that they could dance for joy.""  Accordingly, the passage conveys that people really do dance for joy, as well as use the phrase ""dance for joy"" to describe their emotional states.  Therefore, the passage suggests that the phrase ""dance for joy"" represents both a phenomenon of language and a behavior in which people actually engage.
(Choice C)  The question of why humans dance will never be definitively answered.  The passage presents several questions relating to why humans dance, such as: ""What is it about happiness that would lead someone to dance?  What exactly is dancing, when one ponders this activity that might otherwise be taken for granted?"" (Paragraph 1).  However, although the author does not provide answers to all these questions, he or she never expresses doubt about the possibility of answering them.
(Choice D)  There is a difference between unstructured dancing and dances with specific steps.  Paragraph 3 states that ""dance movements signify at most a general feeling or impression rather than corresponding to specific words or ideas.""  Thus, the author describes a difference between dancing and physical movements that communicate specific ideas.  However, he or she never describes a difference between unstructured dancing and dances with specific steps, nor otherwise discusses dance in terms of these two categories."
"32","The claim that dance is a language of emotion is inconsistent with other passage information regarding:","C","6","Even with non-vocal communication such as sign language, the types of bodily movements are qualitatively different from those used in dance, as dance movements signify at most a general feeling or impression rather than corresponding to specific words or ideas.  If the bee's dance functions like human sign language (albeit in a much less sophisticated form), it is probably not an appropriate analogue to human dance at all; the term ""dance"" would be simply a weak metaphor.  Thus, if the bee's dance is a type of language, it is not the same sort of thing as human dance. (Paragraph 3)
Nevertheless, such a connection is clearly not the whole story.  One of the most fundamental uses of dance is the physical expression of music—a language not of words, but emotion. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 3 draws a distinction between movements used for dance and movements used for language.  According to the author, ""Even with non-vocal communication such as sign language, the types of bodily movements are qualitatively different from those used in dance.""  The author then makes a similar point by contrasting human dancing and bee dancing, claiming that ""if the bee's dance is a type of language, it is not the same sort of thing as human dance.""  Hence, this part of the passage states that, unlike bee dancing, human dancing is not a type of language.
However, in Paragraph 5, the author asserts that ""[o]ne of the most fundamental uses of dance is the physical expression of music—a language not of words, but emotion.""  Accordingly, this part of the passage states that human dance is a type of language (ie, a language of emotion).
Therefore, the claim that dance is a language of emotion is inconsistent with other passage information regarding the contrast between bee dancing and human dancing.
 By contrast, the claim that dance is a language of emotion is consistent with the passage information regarding:
the idea that it is comparatively rare to actually dance for joy (Choice A).  Paragraph 6 asserts that ""happiness too can be seen in a smile, and to actually dance for joy is comparatively rare.""  This statement implies that it is more common to express the emotion of happiness through different ways than dancing.  However, it does not challenge the idea that dance is ""a language not of words, but emotion"" (Paragraph 5).
the role of dancing in mate selection (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 5, the human tendency to connect dance with romance ""is clearly not the whole story.  One of the most fundamental uses of dance is the physical expression of music.""  Therefore, the passage describes mate selection and the expression of music as simply two separate motivations for human dancing.
the concern that dance is a corrupting influence (Choice D).  Paragraph 4 describes how ""in the 1950s Elvis was denounced by parents as a corrupting influence,"" and notes that people today ""likewise voice concerns with regard to the behavior of crowds in nightclubs and explicit lyrics in popular music.""  However, the claim that dance is a language of emotion does not contradict this information about parental concern.  Rather, that concern is based on the idea that dance does express emotion, but in a way that can corrupt young people."
"33","The passage implies that which of the following is true of human dance?","C","6","People sometimes dance for joy, or report that they are so happy that they could dance for joy. (Paragraph 1)
Indeed, some animals do seem to dance, although their reasons for doing so are goal-based.  For instance, bees dance to provide instructions to other colony members….  This behavior is not emotive; it would seem odd, if not unscientific, to ascribe an emotive character to such displays.  Nevertheless, these displays are communicative, as are emotive human behaviors. (Paragraph 2)
Many animals perform courtship displays of varying complexity, in which carefully choreographed movements are designed to win the favor of a potential mate.  Historically, a connection between human dance and courtship has also been assumed, and often cautioned against. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 1 states that people may ""dance for joy,"" thereby using dance to express an emotion.  Similarly, the passage goes on to assert that dancing behaviors ""are communicative"" in both animals and humans (Paragraph 2).  For instance, ""bees dance to provide instructions to other colony members"" (Paragraph 2), and both animals and human beings use dance to express interest through ""courtship displays"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, the passage implies that human dance conveys information, as does animal dance.
 (Choice A)  It evolved for similar reasons as animal dance did.  Paragraph 3 suggests that there might be ""a common evolutionary basis for the dance of humans and other animals.""  However, the author also points out that ""there are differences which cast doubt on that hypothesis.""  Therefore, although the passage raises the possibility that human dance and animal dance evolved for similar reasons, it also suggests that this might not be the case.
(Choice B)  It developed in response to specific social pressures.  The passage discusses some of the social aspects of dance, such as the ""connection between human dance and courtship"" (Paragraph 4) and the fact that weddings typically ""include dance as a matter of custom"" (Paragraph 5).  However, the passage does not suggest that specific social pressures led to the development of dance as a phenomenon.
(Choice D)  It is a widely studied aspect of human society.  In Paragraph 1, the author asks: ""What exactly is dancing, when one ponders this activity that might otherwise be taken for granted?""  This remark suggests that the phenomenon of human dance is something that most people do not seriously think about, but simply accept without questioning.  Therefore, the passage does not imply that dance is a widely studied aspect of human society."
"34","The author's assertion that ""a fully evocative rendering"" of Psalm 119 seems unattainable is most likely meant to suggest that no translations of Psalm 119 have:","A","7","Strict fidelity to the specific words of a text often fails to capture the full sense of its meaning.  Beyond this loss of meaning can also arise a loss of artistry and structural features that often cannot be replicated. (Paragraph 1)
For instance, a fully evocative rendering of the 119th Psalm seems unattainable.…  [I]n the original Hebrew the Psalm is an acrostic: the verses of the first strophe all begin with the letter aleph, those of the second with beth, and so on, with tav, the last letter of the alphabet, commencing the final eight verses.  The reader of a translation would, understandably, be ignorant of this fact.  While this does not affect the essential meaning of the verses, it does affect their character—something is lost from the original in its non-native presentation.  Although there have been occasional attempts to mimic this structure in other languages, they have all been unsuccessful.  The tortured and unnatural wording that results proves the wisdom of most translators in prioritizing readability. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 1, a significant difficulty of translating works into another language is the ""loss of artistry and structural features that often cannot be replicated.""  Paragraph 2 then provides an example of this issue, with the author asserting that ""a fully evocative rendering of the 119th Psalm seems unattainable.""
Specifically, most translations of Psalm 119 do not capture its poetic structure.  As Paragraph 2 explains, ""[I]n the original Hebrew the Psalm is an acrostic: the verses of the first strophe (set of verses comprising a section of a poem) all begin with the letter aleph, those of the second with beth, and so on.""  However, because this feature of the Psalm is based on its presentation in Hebrew, ""[t]he reader of a translation would, understandably, be ignorant of this fact.""  Moreover, the few translations that do attempt to preserve the acrostic ""have all been unsuccessful"" because of the ""tortured and unnatural wording that results.""
The author further conveys that while the absence of the acrostic ""does not affect the essential meaning of the verses, it does affect their character—something is lost from the original in its non-native presentation"" (Paragraph 2).  Thus, the passage indicates that translations of Psalm 119 have successfully conveyed its meaning but not its poetic features.  Consequently, the author's assertion that ""a fully evocative rendering"" of Psalm 119 seems unattainable is most likely meant to suggest that no translations of Psalm 119 have successfully represented the Psalm's aesthetic character (ie, its artistry or stylistic elements).
 (Choice B)  focused on capturing the Psalm's aesthetic presentation.  Paragraph 2 states that ""[a]lthough there have been occasional attempts to mimic this structure (ie, the acrostic) in other languages, they have all been unsuccessful.""  Accordingly, the author conveys that some translations of Psalm 119 have focused on capturing the Psalm's aesthetic presentation, but these cases have unfortunately resulted in ""tortured and unnatural wording.""
(Choices C and D)  conveyed the Psalm's meaning in natural wording; and accurately reflected the meaning of the Hebrew words.  According to Paragraph 2, ""a fully evocative rendering of the 119th Psalm seems unattainable"" because its poetic structure cannot feasibly be preserved in translation.  However, losing this structure ""does not affect the essential meaning of the verses.""  Furthermore, the passage mentions ""the wisdom of most translators in prioritizing readability.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that some translations of Psalm 119 have accurately reflected the meaning of the Hebrew words and done so using natural wording."
"35","Why does the author most likely discuss ""Borges' idiosyncratic expression"" (Paragraph 3)?","A","7","Another concern is what might be called translational multiplicity.  Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges famously remarked: ""The Quixote, due to my congenital practice of Spanish, is a uniform monument, with no other variations….  [T]he Odyssey, thanks to my opportune ignorance of Greek, is an international bookstore of works in prose and verse.""…  Thus, a perennial difficulty of translation is conveyed through Borges' idiosyncratic expression.  Or is it?  For Borges' remarks are elsewhere listed as: ""Since Spanish is my native language, the Quixote is to me an unchanging monument, with no possible variations….  But the Odyssey, thanks to my opportune ignorance of Greek, is a library of works in prose and verse.""  That we might ask which of these translations more closely represents his actual words is a fact that Borges would likely have found amusing. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 discusses the problem of ""what might be called translational multiplicity.""  When a work is translated into another language, there are often several versions that may differ in certain ways.  Thus, it is not always clear which of these competing translations best reflects the work's meaning in its native language.
To illustrate this issue, the author presents what ""Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges famously remarked.""  Because Borges was a native Spanish speaker, Don Quixote was for him ""'a uniform monument, with no other variations.'""  By contrast, because he did not know Greek, the Odyssey was ""'an international bookstore of works in prose and verse.'""  Thus, Borges emphasizes that when a work is translated, there may be many possible versions rather than a single translation that precisely corresponds to the original.
Ironically, however, this quote may not truly reflect ""Borges' idiosyncratic expression"" (ie, his particular manner of speaking) because it has also been translated differently.  The author cites a second translation of Borges' remark, pointing out that ""we might ask which of these translations more closely represents his actual words.""  Hence, the two versions of Borges' quote themselves exemplify the very point that he was making: rendering his words in another language yields multiple translations to choose from, leaving it unclear which one best represents what he said in the original Spanish.
Consequently, the author most likely discusses ""Borges' idiosyncratic expression"" (Paragraph 3) in order to exemplify the difficulty of producing translations that precisely correspond to an original work.
 By contrast, the author does not most likely discuss ""Borges' idiosyncratic expression"" in order:
To make the point that Borges' words have likely been misunderstood (Choice B).  Although the author presents two versions of what ""Borges famously remarked"" (Paragraph 3), those versions differ chiefly in style and word choice rather than in overall meaning.  Thus, the author does not suggest that Borges' words have likely been misunderstood.  Rather, he or she implies that both translations capture the general idea of what Borges said, but differ in certain details.
To present a crucial difference between translations of the Odyssey and Don Quixote (Choice C).  Borges indicates that ""due to [his] congenital practice of Spanish"" he could read Don Quixote in its original language, but his ""ignorance of Greek"" meant he could read the Odyssey only in translation (Paragraph 3).  However, these are facts about Borges, not about the translated works; the passage author never suggests that there is a crucial difference between translations of the Odyssey and Don Quixote.
To anticipate the later discussion about more subtle types of translation (Choice D).  Paragraph 5 describes ""more subtle types of translation,"" such as the title of a book being changed ""due to a belief that the original title would be unpalatable (ie, unappealing or off-putting) to an American audience.""  However, this example concerns a deliberate change to a work based on audience reaction, not a question of which translation best reflects the original."
"36","Which of the following types of writing would likely be the most difficult to successfully translate, based on the information in the passage?","C","7","Strict fidelity to the specific words of a text often fails to capture the full sense of its meaning.  Beyond this loss of meaning can also arise a loss of artistry and structural features that often cannot be replicated. (Paragraph 1)
For instance, a fully evocative rendering of the 119th Psalm seems unattainable.  Comprising twenty-two strophes of eight lines each, the one hundred and seventy-six verses do appear somewhat poetic in translation.  But in the original Hebrew the Psalm is an acrostic: the verses of the first strophe all begin with the letter aleph, those of the second with beth, and so on, with tav, the last letter of the alphabet, commencing the final eight verses.  The reader of a translation would, understandably, be ignorant of this fact....  [S]omething is lost from the original in its non-native presentation.  Although there have been occasional attempts to mimic this structure in other languages, they have all been unsuccessful. (Paragraph 2)
In describing difficulties with translation, the author emphasizes the ""loss of artistry and structural features that often cannot be replicated"" in translated works (Paragraph 1).  An example of this difficulty can be seen in translations of Psalm 119.  As Paragraph 2 explains, ""in the original Hebrew the Psalm is an acrostic,"" but attempts to reproduce this poetic structure in other languages ""have all been unsuccessful.""  Thus, this aspect of the Psalm ""is lost from the original in its non-native presentation.""
Accordingly, the passage suggests that works with specific artistic or structural features, like the poetic form in Psalm 119, are especially difficult to translate.  Similarly, it is likely that a love song in which a minstrel praises the charms of his beloved would include features such as poetic language, rhyme schemes, rhythms, and evocative imagery.  Therefore, based on the information in the passage, such a song would likely be the most difficult type of writing to translate.

By contrast, since none of the following types of writing would likely include such aesthetic features, they would be less difficult to translate:
a genealogical record explaining the royal ancestry of a king (Choice A).  A genealogical record would provide individuals' names and familial relationships across generations.  Thus, such a record would constitute a straightforward list of information with no inherent reason to be presented artistically.
a legal proclamation describing the types and quantities of crops to be grown by farmers (Choice B).  Such a proclamation would most likely aim at simple and direct communication rather than poetic flourishes.
a religious treatise in which a priest decries the people's lack of faith (Choice D).  Although the scripture Psalm 119 is used as an example of a work that is difficult to translate, the passage indicates that this difficulty comes from the Psalm's poetic features, not its religious subject matter.  Since no information is given to suggest that the priest's treatise is poetic, one cannot assume that it would be especially difficult to translate."
"37","Based on the information in the final paragraph, the author views the change to the American title of the Harry Potter book as being:","D","7","The book known as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in England was changed to refer instead to the ""Sorcerer's Stone"" in the United States, reportedly due to a belief that the original title would be unpalatable to an American audience.  While that depressing assumption may indeed have been correct, the change removes a titular connection to a pre-existing myth.  The generic fantasy idea with which it is replaced thus fails to embody the full character of the original work. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, ""The book known as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in England was changed to refer instead to the 'Sorcerer's Stone' in the United States.""  The author attributes this change to ""a belief that the original title would be unpalatable (ie, unappealing or off-putting) to an American audience,"" noting that this ""depressing assumption may indeed have been correct.""  Therefore, the author finds it depressing that the title needed to be changed for American audiences, despite conceding that the motivation behind the change was likely justified.
Similarly, the author laments that ""the change removes a titular connection to a pre-existing myth.  The generic fantasy idea with which it is replaced thus fails to embody the full character of the original work"" (Paragraph 5).  Hence, the author further portrays the change to the title as unfortunate and detracting from the original work.  Consequently, based on the information in the final paragraph, the author views the change to the American title of the Harry Potter book as being disappointing (ie, depressing and lamentable).
 (Choices A and B)  ill-considered; and unwarranted.  Paragraph 5 states that the book's title was changed ""due to a belief that the original title would be unpalatable to an American audience.""  By adding that this ""depressing assumption may indeed have been correct,"" the author implies that the change was made in response to a reasonable concern.  Accordingly, the author views the change as being justified, not ill-considered or unwarranted.
(Choice C)  insensitive.  Although the author views the title's change as based on a ""depressing assumption"" (Paragraph 5), he or she never suggests that making the change was insensitive (ie, callous or uncaring).  In addition, as the change was reportedly based on ""a belief that the original title would be unpalatable to an American audience,"" it arguably reflects a sensitivity to how that audience would react."
"38","The passage author would most likely agree with which of the following quotes about translation?","D","7","But in the original Hebrew the Psalm is an acrostic: the verses of the first strophe all begin with the letter aleph, those of the second with beth, and so on, with tav, the last letter of the alphabet, commencing the final eight verses….  Although there have been occasional attempts to mimic this structure in other languages, they have all been unsuccessful.  The tortured and unnatural wording that results proves the wisdom of most translators in prioritizing readability. (Paragraph 2)
Rather, Lau was keenly aware of a difficult truth: the fluidity of language and culture over time can shroud the works of the ancients in obscurities that may be inscrutable to even their most passionately curious descendants. (Paragraph 4)
According to the passage, translators face tension between two goals: preserving the particular wording of an original work, and conveying the spirit of that work in words that sound natural.  For example, Paragraph 2 states that trying to maintain Psalm 119's poetic structure produces ""tortured and unnatural wording"" that ""proves the wisdom of most translators in prioritizing readability.""  Accordingly, this case exemplifies a conflict between reflecting a work's literary character and expressing its meaning in another language.
Similarly, Paragraph 4 suggests that because both language and culture evolve, words may have a different meaning today than they did in their original context.  Thus, because of ""the fluidity of language and culture over time,"" it may be impossible for a translation to capture both the original words used in a work and the meaning those words are intended to convey.
Therefore, the passage author would most likely agree that the requirements of literal accuracy and literary accuracy are often in conflict.
 (Choice A)  ""[T]he attempt at translating a foreign text is often just a reflection of one's own self.""  The passage discusses several issues that arise with translation, such as ""a loss of artistry and structural features"" (Paragraph 1) and concerns about ""translational multiplicity"" (Paragraph 3).  However, the author never mentions problems specifically with translators, nor suggests that translators' personal outlooks and biases prevent them from translating accurately (ie, that their translations are just reflections of themselves).
(Choice B)  ""The practice of translation is fraught with many problematic issues which…are likely to go unexamined, even unarticulated.""  The passage begins by referring to ""the myriad problems facing translators"" (Paragraph 1), and the author never suggests that these difficulties have been unexamined or unarticulated.  Rather, the passage depicts scholars as acknowledging these problems.  For instance, Paragraph 3 presents Borges' quote as illustrating a ""perennial (perpetual or long-lasting) difficulty of translation.""  Similarly, Paragraph 4 cites D. C. Lau's conviction that ""none of us truly understand classical Chinese,"" exemplifying awareness of the complications caused by ""the fluidity of language and culture over time.""  Hence, the author seems to portray such problematic issues with translation as generally recognized and confronted.
(Choice C)  ""In literary translation, it is not the transfer of information but of style that is crucial to the effects experienced by the target reader.""  According to Paragraph 2, Psalm 119 is an example where it is difficult for translations to mimic the original style of a work while also conveying its information clearly.  Attempting to preserve the Psalm's poetic structure in translation results in ""tortured and unnatural wording"" that ""proves the wisdom of most translators in prioritizing readability.""  Thus, the author conveys that in this case, it is more important to clearly express the Psalm's meaning than to replicate the style in which it was written.  Given this example, the author would not agree that transferring style is more crucial than transferring information."
"39","Passage information suggests that Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence of the Same:","B","8","Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence…is ""part-parable, part-thought-experiment,"" a stern summons to re-examine our relationship with life and carefully consider the consequences of our choices. (Paragraph 2)
In describing the philosopher's idea as ""a deceptively simple yet profound proposition,"" writer Maria Popova acknowledges that the concept of Eternal Recurrence challenges us to confront ""the specter of infinite monotony,"" a task requiring the courage to accept—indeed, to want—what is and demanding nothing less than ""the ultimate embrace of responsibility."" (Paragraph 3)
According to Gambardella, Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence of the Same is ""'part-parable, part-thought-experiment,' a stern summons to re-examine our relationship with life and carefully consider the consequences of our choices.""  Gambardella further stresses that ""Nietzsche's concept provides 'an alternative ethical benchmark to religious ethical systems.'  Whereas many religions promise followers an afterlife of eternal reward or punishment based on conduct in this life, Nietzsche posits only the prospect of 'an impermanent life repeating eternally'"" (Paragraph 2).
Furthermore, Paragraph 3 conveys Popova's view that ""the concept of Eternal Recurrence forces us to confront 'the specter of infinite monotony,' a task requiring the courage to accept…what is and demanding nothing less than 'the ultimate embrace of responsibility.'""
Accordingly, the concept of Eternal Recurrence serves to place one's actions into a larger context in which they endlessly recur.  Actions that are recurring rather than singular passing events demand greater personal responsibility.  Therefore, passage information suggests that Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence of the Same reframes a person's life experiences to emphasize accountability.
By contrast, passage information does not suggest that Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence of the Same:
encourages a person to affirm religious beliefs (Choice A).  Nietzsche's concept provides what Gambardella calls ""'an alternative ethical benchmark to religious ethical systems.'  Whereas many religions promise followers an afterlife of eternal reward or punishment based on conduct in this life, Nietzsche posits only the prospect of ""an impermanent life repeating eternally'"" (Paragraph 2).  Consequently, Nietzsche's concept is presented not as an affirmation of religious beliefs but as an alternative to them.
fails to rival the gravity of metaphysics and teleology (Choice C).  In Paragraph 2, Hatab claims that ""[t]his endless repetition of the same has…the power to eradicate all metaphysics (ie, conceptions about the fundamental nature of reality), remove the teleology (ie, assumption of a definite purpose, end, or goal) associated with linear time, and erase 'all afters and beyonds,' leaving nothing but 'the here and now.'""  This information shows that, by proposing a radical acceptance of an infinitely repeating present, the concept of Eternal Recurrence is easily comparable to metaphysics and teleology in its gravity (seriousness).
frees a person from unrealistic expectations (Choice D).  According to Hatab, ""This endless repetition of the same has…the power to eradicate all metaphysics, remove the teleology associated with linear time, and erase 'all afters and beyonds,' leaving nothing but 'the here and now'"" (Paragraph 2).  While this information suggests that Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence could free a person from the expectations created by metaphysics and teleology, the passage overall does not discuss expectations."
"40","The author mentions Nietzsche's quote, ""Have you ever said Yes to a single joy?...then you have said Yes too to all woe"" (Paragraph 4), in order to:","D","8","This doctrine of complete acceptance links Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence to a concept known as amor fati….  Nietzsche believed such extreme affirmation epitomized bravery: ""My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity.""  One must ""[n]ot merely bear what is necessary…but love it""—as if having willed to happen exactly what has happened.  This imperative tolerates no omissions: ""Have you ever said Yes to a single joy?...then you have said Yes too to all woe.  All things are entangled, ensnared, enamored; if ever you wanted one thing twice…then you wanted all back.""  Nor are revisions allowed: unlike the protagonist of the film Groundhog Day Groundhog Day who can make different choices in reliving the same February 2nd over and over, one cannot redo anything.  Nevertheless, Nietzsche proposes that radical affirmation can simultaneously redeem what was, is, and will be. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 conveys Nietzsche's thoughts on amor fati: ""'My formula for greatness…is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity.'  One must '[n]ot merely bear what is necessary…but love it'—as if having willed to happen exactly what has happened.""  Paragraph 4 also states that this Nietzschean notion of complete acceptance or radical affirmation not only includes saying ""Yes"" to every woe, but also ""tolerates no omissions"" or ""revisions"" of any kind.
Accordingly, practicing amor fati is a difficult and complex task requiring an individual to muster the will to accept everything in life without exception.  Therefore, the author mentions Nietzsche's quote, ""Have you ever said Yes to a single joy?...then you have said Yes too to all woe"" (Paragraph 4), in order to intimate that commitment to amor fati is itself a complex act of will.
By contrast, the author does not mention Nietzsche's quote in order to:
reveal the intricacies of fate as less coherent than one might assume (Choice A).  After mentioning Nietzsche's quote, Paragraph 4 provides the philosopher's elaboration that ""'[a]ll things are entangled, ensnared, enamored; if ever you wanted one thing twice…then you wanted all back.'""  This information shows that in Nietzsche's vision, everything that happens in life is completely interconnected or coherent with everything else.
illustrate that the teachings of amor fati are harder to follow than those of Eternal Recurrence (Choice B).  Paragraph 4 states that ""the doctrine of complete acceptance links Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence to a concept known as amor fati—a 'love of fate' that exhorts one to affirm life's every detail.  Nietzsche believed such extreme affirmation epitomized (exemplified) bravery.""  However, although the passage author links the concepts of Eternal Recurrence and amor fati, he or she does not explicitly compare them.
depict Nietzsche's concepts regarding fate as unattainable ideals (Choice C).  Paragraph 4 explains the concept of amor fati as a ""'love of fate' that exhorts (urges) one to affirm life's every detail.""  Paragraph 4 then conveys that ""Nietzsche believed such extreme affirmation epitomized bravery: 'My formula for greatness in a human being is amor fati: that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity.'  One must '[n]ot merely bear what is necessary…but love it'—as if having willed to happen exactly what has happened.""  Accordingly, the author suggests that although Nietzsche's ideals about fate are extremely difficult to attain, they are not impossible."
"41","Based on the passage, Lawrence Hatab's view of Eternal Recurrence most strongly suggests that:","A","8","Similarly, Lawrence Hatab describes the Nietzschean universe as ""a finite-world-in-infinite-process.""  This endless repetition of the same has, Hatab stresses, the power to eradicate all metaphysics, remove the teleology associated with linear time, and erase ""all afters and beyonds,"" leaving nothing but ""the here and now."" (Paragraph 2)
In Paragraph 2, Hatab claims that Nietzsche's ""endless repetition of the same has…the power to eradicate all metaphysics (ie, conceptions about the fundamental nature of reality), remove the teleology (ie, the assumption of a definite purpose, end, or goal) associated with linear time, and erase 'all afters and beyonds,' leaving nothing but 'the here and now.'""
In this way, the Eternal Recurrence of the Same directs a person's attention away from any kind of afterlife and back toward the here and now with the stark realization that this is all there is.  Accordingly, the elimination of anything other than the here and now accentuates the present, while the knowledge that it will infinitely repeat serves to increase its weight or significance.  Therefore, based on the passage, Lawrence Hatab's view of Eternal Recurrence most strongly suggests that the ceaseless recurrence of the same tends to make the present more important.
By contrast, Hatab's view of Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence does not suggest that:
the prospect of repeating events effectively reduces the present to a burden (Choice B).  Paragraph 2 conveys Hatab's statement that Nietzsche's ""endless repetition of the same has…the power to eradicate all metaphysics, remove the teleology associated with linear time, and erase 'all afters and beyonds,' leaving nothing but 'the here and now.'""  Although Hatab's view of Eternal Recurrence suggests that the repetition of events coupled with the absence of ""afters and beyonds"" intensifies the focus on the here and now, making it more important, this does not mean that the present is reduced to being a burden.
conscientious individuals should turn their attention from the present to the afterlife (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 2, Hatab sees Eternal Recurrence as ""having the power to … erase 'all afters and beyonds,' leaving nothing but 'the here and now.'""  Hatab thus expresses Nietzsche's denial of any afterlife, indicating that individuals must turn their attention to living in the present.  Therefore, suggesting instead that conscientious individuals should turn their attention from the present to the afterlife would contradict Hatab's view.
knowledge that the present will repeat infinitely makes time seem less fleeting (Choice D).  Hatab relays the view that Eternal Recurrence has ""the power to…remove the teleology associated with linear time…leaving nothing but 'the here and now'"" (Paragraph 2).  Accordingly, knowing that the present will repeat endlessly would likely free individuals from concerns about an afterlife and help them focus on the present as more important.  However, this knowledge would not necessarily change the perception of the speed of time as it passes."
"42","Gambardella's use of such terms as ""parable"" and ""ethical benchmark"" to explain Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence suggests that he believes:","C","8","Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence, or the notion that, as Steven Gambardella expresses it, ""time is a circle and all things are bound and repeated for eternity,"" defies literal belief; however, it should not be reduced to a metaphor nor dismissed as, in one scholar's words, ""a bizarre, fanciful, and poetic idea.""  More properly, Gambardella proposes, it is ""part-parable, part-thought-experiment,"" a stern summons to re-examine our relationship with life and carefully consider the consequences of our choices.  In Gambardella's view, Nietzsche's concept provides ""an alternative ethical benchmark to religious ethical systems.""  Whereas many religions promise followers an afterlife of eternal reward or punishment based on conduct in this life, Nietzsche posits only the prospect of ""an impermanent life repeating eternally."" (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, ""Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence…defies literal belief; however, it should not be reduced to a metaphor nor dismissed as…'a bizarre, fanciful, and poetic idea.'""  Instead, Steven Gambardella proposes that the concept ""is 'part-parable, part-thought-experiment,' a stern summons to re-examine our relationship with life and carefully consider the consequences of our choices.""  Gambardella further claims that ""Nietzsche's concept provides 'an alternative ethical benchmark to religious ethical systems.'""
Accordingly, Gambardella believes that Nietzsche's concept should be applied in thinking about one's ""relationship to life"" and should serve as ""an ethical benchmark"" or standard for behavior.  Therefore, Gambardella's use of such terms as ""parable"" and ""ethical benchmark"" suggests he believes that Nietzsche's concept of Eternal Recurrence should not be understood as purely hypothetical.
(Choice A)  In Paragraph 2, Gambardella proposes that as ""'part-parable, part-thought-experiment,'"" Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence issues ""a stern summons to re-examine our relationship with life and carefully consider the consequences of our choices.""  Gambardella also posits that ""Nietzsche's concept provides 'an alternative ethical benchmark to religious ethical systems.'""  Accordingly, Gambardella's use of terms such as ""parable"" and ""ethical benchmark"" suggests he believes that Nietzsche offers a moral lesson and serious perspective on life but not an essentially harsh worldview.
(Choice B)  According to Gambardella, ""Nietzsche's concept provides 'an alternative ethical benchmark to religious ethical systems.'  Whereas many religions promise followers an afterlife of eternal reward or punishment based on conduct in this life, Nietzsche posits only the prospect of 'an impermanent life repeating eternally'"" (Paragraph 2).  In thus describing Nietzsche's concept as providing ""an alternative ethical benchmark,"" Gambardella suggests that it may appeal to people outside religious systems.  Therefore, Gambardella's use of these terms does not suggest he believes that the religiously inclined are the most receptive to Nietzsche's concept.
(Choice D)  As Paragraph 2 states, ""In Gambardella's view, Nietzsche's concept provides 'an alternative ethical benchmark to religious ethical systems.'  Whereas many religions promise followers an afterlife of eternal reward or punishment based on conduct in this life, Nietzsche posits only the prospect of 'an impermanent life repeating eternally.'""  Accordingly, the passage indicates that Gambardella's use of these terms suggests he believes that Nietzsche wanted to offer an alternative moral standard of equal weight to those found in religious ethical systems.  However, the passage does not indicate that by using these terms Gambardella suggests he believes that Nietzsche wanted to avoid using religious or theological (having to do with the divine) language to describe this alternative standard."
"43","Of the following assertions, which most directly challenges a passage claim?","C","8","Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence, or the notion that…""time is a circle and all things are bound and repeated for eternity,"" defies literal belief; however, it should not be reduced to a metaphor nor dismissed as…""a bizarre, fanciful, and poetic idea.""  More properly, Gambardella proposes, it is ""part-parable, part-thought-experiment,"" a stern summons to re-examine our relationship with life and carefully consider the consequences of our choices.  In Gambardella's view, Nietzsche's concept provides ""an alternative ethical benchmark to religious ethical systems.""  Whereas many religions promise followers an afterlife of eternal reward or punishment based on conduct in this life, Nietzsche posits only the prospect of ""an impermanent life repeating eternally."" (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, ""Gambardella proposes [that Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence of the Same] is 'part-parable, part-thought-experiment,' a stern summons to re-examine our relationship with life and carefully consider the consequences of our choices.""  Paragraph 2 also conveys that ""Nietzsche's concept provides [what Gambardella calls] 'an alternative ethical benchmark to religious ethical systems.'""  More specifically, as Paragraph 2 explains, ""Whereas many religions promise followers an afterlife of eternal reward or punishment based on conduct in this life,"" Nietzsche's concept promises ""the prospect of 'an impermanent life repeating eternally.'""
This information shows that by asking people to carefully consider their choices, knowing they will recur forever, Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence of the Same can be seen to provide an ethical or moral context for behavior.  Consequently, the assertation that believers in Eternal Recurrence lack a moral framework for their conduct strongly challenges a passage claim.
By contrast, the following assertions are consistent with passage claims:
The proposition that the events repeat endlessly may alter how people think about their lives (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 2, ""Gambardella proposes [that Eternal Recurrence] is 'part-parable, part-thought-experiment,' a stern summons to re-examine our relationship with life and carefully consider the consequences of our choices.""  Therefore, when faced with the prospect of the endless repetition of events, people may start to consider things more carefully, thus changing how they think about their lives.
People are better served by viewing past events in their lives as self-willed rather than predetermined (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 4, ""This doctrine of complete acceptance links Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence to a concept known as amor fati—a 'love of fate' that exhorts (urges) one to affirm life's every detail.""  As Nietzsche put it, ""One must '[n]ot merely bear what is necessary…but love it'—as if having willed to happen exactly what has happened.""  This information suggests that in Nietzsche's thinking, it is preferable for individuals to look upon past events as self-willed rather than predetermined.
The cyclical nature of time precludes an end point toward which to aim (Choice D).  According to Hatab,""[t]his endless repetition of the same has…the power to…remove the teleology (ie, the assumption of a definite purpose, end, or goal) associated with linear time, and erase 'all afters and beyonds,' leaving nothing but 'the here and now'"" (Paragraph 2).  Therefore, unlike linear time, cyclical time, as in the Eternal Recurrence of the Same, endlessly repeats itself and so cannot be headed to a specific end."
"44","Based on passage information, it can most reasonably be inferred that most of the conversation between characters in noir films from the 1940s and 1950s was derived from:","B","9","Noir drew inspiration for its scenery from classic movies about bootlegging and heists but primarily imported its storylines and dialogue from the crime novels and pulp magazine tales of the Depression Era. (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, noir ""drew inspiration for its scenery from classic movies about bootlegging and heists, but primarily imported its storylines and dialogue from the crime novels and pulp magazine tales of the Depression Era.""  Consequently, the passage makes it clear that most of the dialogue or conversation between the characters in noir films of the 1940s and 1950s was derived from novels (""crime novels"") and magazines (""pulp magazine tales"").
(Choice A)  Paragraph 1 mentions ""movies about bootlegging and heists"" as an influence on noir, but clearly states that these movies provided only the ""scenery"" for noir film.  Paragraph 1 also indicates that the ""storylines and dialogue"" of noir were ""primarily imported from the crime novels and pulp magazine tales of the Depression Era.""
(Choice C)  According to Paragraph 1, existentialism (a philosophical movement that was influential in the 1940s and 1950s) was one of several ""contemporary cultural strains"" that film noir ""readily absorbed.""  However, Paragraph 1 also says that noir ""primarily imported its storylines and dialogue from the crime novels and pulp magazine tales of the Depression Era,"" not from existentialism.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 1 states that noir ""borrowed from French poetic realist cinema a fundamentally jaundiced and tragic worldview,"" but it does not indicate that it ever borrowed dialogue from this source."
"45","Based on the passage, which of the following scenarios would represent a noir convention?
A private eye goes undercover.
A plot is nonlinear.
A woman is attractive.","D","9","Apart from a brooding mood, or pervasive sense of pessimism and meaninglessness, noir conventions include the investigation of a crime and a difficult-to-decipher plot unfolding in flashback sequences and accompanied by voiceover narration. (Paragraph 2)
Standard noir roles include an isolated, ""hardboiled"" detective and a dangerous female character who proves as duplicitous as she is sharp-tongued and glamorous. (Paragraph 3)
The Big Sleep and The Lady from Shanghai are notorious for the many twists and turns of their incoherent plots…. (Paragraph 4)
Based on the passage, all the following scenarios would represent noir conventions:
A private eye goes undercover (Number I).  According to Paragraph 3, a standard role in film noir is ""an isolated, 'hardboiled' (tough and cynical) detective.""  This detective or private eye would have the job of investigating the crime using methods such as going undercover.
A plot is nonlinear (Number II).  According to Paragraph 2, a convention of film noir is ""a difficult-to-decipher plot unfolding in flashback sequences accompanied by voiceover narration.""  Moreover, Paragraph 4 mentions the noir films The Big Sleep and The Lady from Shanghai as ""notorious for the many twists and turns of their incoherent plots.""  These descriptions imply that the typical noir plot is twisted or nonlinear.
A woman is attractive (Number III).  In Paragraph 3, the main female character in film noir is typically not only ""dangerous"" but also ""proves as duplicitous as she is sharp-tongued and glamorous (attractive or alluring).""  Consequently, an attractive woman would be common in noir."
"46","In the passage, adjectives such as ""indistinct,"" ""elusive,"" and ""ambiguous"" are used to describe the phenomenon of film noir.  The author most likely uses these descriptive words to suggest that:","A","9","Despite conventions so recognizable they have hardened into clichés that lend themselves to parody, as a genre noir remains indistinct. (Paragraph 4)
Noir is so notoriously ambiguous and elusive that many films from the era flirt with the classification. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 4 states that ""despite conventions so recognizable they have hardened into clichés…as a genre, noir remains indistinct.""  Paragraph 5 describes noir as ""elusive"" and ""ambiguous"" to the extent that ""many films from the era flirt with the classification.""  Therefore, the author most likely uses these descriptive words to suggest that noir is a phenomenon without a clear definition or categorization.
Accordingly, the author's use of these terms to describe noir does not suggest that:
noir conventions are indecipherable to viewers of such films (Choice B).  Paragraph 2 mentions that noir films tend to have ""difficult-to-decipher"" plots, but it does not indicate that other conventions of film noir, such as the ""pervasive sense of pessimism and meaninglessness"" or its ""stock character types"" (Paragraph 2) are also indecipherable.
noir films are best understood by movie critics (Choice C).  The passage indicates that noir often features ""difficult-to-decipher"" plots (Paragraph 2) that may even be ""incoherent"" (Paragraph 4), but the author does not suggest that other aspects of film noir are difficult to understand.  Moreover, even though Paragraph 5 mentions that Citizen Kane ""is considered noir by some critics,"" the passage never suggests that a person must be a movie critic in order to understand a noir film.
""noir"" is a vague descriptor applied to too few films (Choice D).  Paragraph 4 says that ""as a genre noir remains indistinct.""  Paragraph 5 states that ""many films from the era flirt with the classification"" of noir, precisely because such a classification is ""elusive"" and ""ambiguous.""  On the whole, the passage demonstrates that as a loose category and vague descriptor or label, the term ""noir"" has been applied to many films."
"47","According to the passage author, which of the following describes a feature of many noir-style films?","A","9","[N]oir…borrowed from French poetic realist cinema a fundamentally jaundiced and tragic worldview. (Paragraph 1)
Apart from a brooding mood, or pervasive sense of pessimism and meaninglessness, noir conventions include…. (Paragraph 2)
…characters who traverse treacherous ground in a hostile universe where fate is inexorable. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 1 points out that film noir ""borrowed from French poetic realist cinema a fundamentally jaundiced and tragic worldview.""  Similarly, Paragraph 2 states that ""a pervasive sense of pessimism and meaninglessness"" constitutes a noir convention.  Paragraph 3 goes on to stress that an important underlying theme of noir is that the characters must face a ""hostile universe"" and an ""inexorable"" fate.  Therefore, characters fighting against an unchanging destiny (""where fate is inexorable"") describes a feature of many noir-style films.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 1 indicates film noir was ""a highly stylized art form"" that combined different elements, including ""the unsettling cinematography of the German expressionist movement of the 1920s.""  Paragraph 2 discusses film noir's ""distorting and disorienting"" camera angles along with its ""chiaroscuro or contrast lighting,"" both of which are examples of cinematography that is not realistic.  Based on passage evidence, then, striking cinematography that is extremely realistic does not describe a feature of many films of the noir type.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 3 describes the ""standard roles"" or characters typically seen in film noir and states that ""morally questionable character types brought noir into conflict with mid-20th-century American values.""  Consequently, showing many characters from a perspective of traditional American morality is not a feature of many films of the noir type.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 1 mentions the ""stock (common or cliché) character types"" of noir, while Paragraph 3 discusses the ""standard…roles"" found in film noir.  This indicates that many characters in film noir were well established and played typical or predictable and standardized, rather than atypical, roles.  Therefore, based on the passage, depicting characters in atypical roles is not a feature of many noir-style films."
"48","The fact that some critics consider Orson Welles' Citizen Kane noir would most contradict the claim that:","B","9","Noir is so notoriously ambiguous and elusive that many films from the era flirt with the classification.  For example, 1941 saw the release of renowned film director Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, a quasi-documentary drama concerning a publishing magnate, which has long been deemed a masterpiece and is considered noir by some critics.  At the least, it was heavily influential in the development of this film style due to its dark cinematography, enigmatic plot of an investigative nature, voiceover, multiple flashbacks, inventive camera angles, and themes of corruption. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 says that Welles' Citizen Kane ""is considered noir by some critics"" and that ""it was heavily influential in the development of this film style due to its dark cinematography.""  Therefore, the fact that some critics consider Citizen Kane noir—largely because it anticipated the noir style of cinematography—would most directly contradict the claim that the film had little influence on cinematography.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 5 states that Citizen Kane ""is considered noir by some critics"" and that ""[at] the least, it was heavily influential in the development of this film style due to its dark cinematography, enigmatic plot of an investigative nature, voiceover, multiple flashbacks, inventive camera angles, and themes of corruption.""  Such similarities between Citizen Kane and noir film suggest that considering this movie to be noir constitutes a sound inference.  Consequently, the fact that some critics consider Citizen Kane noir would not contradict but might even support the claim that those critics are real experts in noir.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 3 notes that noir's ""stylistic tropes, along with morally questionable character types, brought noir into conflict with mid-20th-century American values.""  This suggests that film noir may have been viewed as troubling or controversial.  Therefore, that some critics consider Citizen Kane noir would not contradict but would instead be consistent with the claim that the films of the renowned director Welles were occasionally controversial.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 5 says that Citizen Kane ""has long been deemed a cinematic masterpiece and is considered noir by some critics.""  However, the passage does not discuss film directors' judgments about either Citizen Kane or noir film in general.  Accordingly, the fact that some critics consider Citizen Kane noir is irrelevant to whether directors admired it as Welles' masterpiece."
"49","Based on the passage, which of the following characters is LEAST likely to be portrayed in a conventional noir film?","D","9","Standard noir roles include an isolated, ""hardboiled"" detective and a dangerous female character who proves as duplicitous as she is sharp-tongued and glamorous.  Often, a kind of anti-hero is also featured—a man disillusioned and marginalized, down on his luck, desperate to escape his past, and morally ambivalent—who makes an easy target for the double-crossing woman. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, noir films typically include ""a dangerous female character who proves as duplicitous as she is sharp-tongued and glamorous,"" meaning a woman who is deceitful yet alluring (attractive).  Paragraph 3 also describes this typical female character as ""double-crossing (betraying),"" reinforcing the notion that she is untrustworthy.  Such a woman would be unlikely to sacrifice for the sake of love.  Consequently, given the information in the passage, an alluring woman who sacrifices everything for love is the least likely character to be portrayed in a conventional noir film.
(Choices A, B, and C)  Paragraph 3 describes a particular type of character who often appears in noir films: ""a kind of anti-hero…a man disillusioned and marginalized, down on his luck, desperate to escape his past, and morally ambivalent.""  At least some of these descriptors could easily apply to any of the following: an aging boxer who loses all his fights in an illegal boxing ring, a business tycoon who is conned out of his fortune, and an ordinary citizen who is suddenly dragged into a life of crime.  Therefore, all these characters represent a type that is likely to be portrayed in a conventional noir film."
"50","Which of the following scenes is most likely to be included in a noir film primarily influenced by the German expressionist movement of the 1920s?","D","9","At the same time, noir imitated the unsettling cinematography of the German expressionist movement of the 1920s and borrowed from French poetic realist cinema a fundamentally jaundiced and tragic worldview. (Paragraph 1)
Camera angles are distorting and disorienting, creating a sense of menace. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 1 says that film noir ""imitated the unsettling cinematography of the German expressionist movement of the 1920s,"" indicating that some imagery in film noir is visually disturbing.  In a similar vein, Paragraph 2 indicates that in film noir, ""camera angles are distorting and disorienting.""  Accordingly, a scene in which a character's reflection is shown in a cracked mirror could constitute an example of cinematography that is ""unsettling"" as well as ""distorting and disorienting.""  It would therefore be the scene most likely to be included in a noir film primarily influenced by the German expressionist movement of the 1920s.
By contrast, the following scenes would not likely be included in such a film as these would not be ""unsettling,"" ""distorting,"" or ""disorienting"":
A man approaches a street lined with nondescript buildings (Choice A).  From the description of this scene, it can be assumed that buildings that are nondescript (unremarkable to look at) would not appear to be ""unsettling.""
A solitary woman overlooks a quiet lake (Choice B).  From the description, it is unclear whether this scene is peaceful or sinister (ie, ""unsettling""), but it does not suggest that there is ""distorting and disorienting"" (Paragraph 2) imagery.
The entrance to a nightclub is illuminated in vibrant colors (Choice C).  A scene that is shot in vibrant colors would constitute a radical departure from the standard ""black-and-white"" (Paragraph 2) cinematography of film noir."
"51","Which of the following statements, if true, would most challenge the author's claims about the Knights Templar?","A","10","The seal of the Knights Templar depicts two knights astride a single horse, a visual testament of the order's poverty at its inception in 1119.  Nevertheless, these Knights of the Temple—who swore oaths not only of poverty but of chastity, loyalty, and bravery—would eventually become one of the wealthiest and most powerful organizations in the medieval world. (Paragraph 1)
Having secured a small benefice from Jerusalem's King Baldwin II, the knights inaugurated their mission at the site of the great Temple of Solomon.  They quickly attracted widespread admiration as well as many recruits from crusaders and other knights.  Within a year of its founding, the order received a financial endowment from the deeply impressed Count of Anjou, whose example was soon followed by other nobles and monarchs.  As early as 1128, the Templars even gained official papal recognition, and their wealth, holdings, and numbers swelled both in the Holy Land and throughout Europe, especially in France and England. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 1, the Templars were originally quite poor: ""The seal of the Knights Templar depicts two knights astride a single horse, a visual testament of the order's poverty at its inception in 1119.""  Paragraph 2 then further elaborates on the creation and funding of the Templar Order: ""Having secured a small benefice (compensation for official service) from Jerusalem's King Baldwin II, the knights inaugurated their mission.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that although the Templars did receive some initial resources from Baldwin II, at that time they were by no means wealthy.
Nevertheless, Paragraph 2 goes on to relate that the Templars did eventually gain wealth, but from other sources: ""Within a year of its founding, the order received a financial endowment from the deeply impressed Count of Anjou, whose example was soon followed by other nobles and monarchs.""  Hence, the passage indicates that it was because of these additional sources of support, rather than Baldwin II's original patronage, that the Templars' ""wealth, holdings, and numbers swelled both in the Holy Land and throughout Europe.""
Consequently, the author's claims about the Knights Templar would be challenged if it were true that the Templars acquired most of their extensive wealth from King Baldwin II.
  By contrast, none of the following statements would challenge the author's claims about the Knights Templar:
The Templars had at times given assistance to Philip the Fair before he plotted against them (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 4, the Templar Order came to an end shortly after ""Philip the Fair of France joined forces with Pope Clement V to engineer the Templars' downfall beginning in 1307.""  However, the passage never discusses any dealings that Philip and the Templars may have had prior to that point.  Therefore, although it might seem especially treacherous if Philip betrayed the Templars after they had aided him, the passage contains no information that would rule out this possibility.
The Templars who originally founded their order had previously considered just living as monks in the Holy Land (Choice C).  Paragraph 2 states that ""[t]he first Templars were nine knights who took an oath to defend the Holy Land and any pilgrims who journeyed there after the First Crusade.""  However, the passage never discusses whether these knights might have originally considered a different life before they founded the Templar Order.
The Templars required their recruits to swear that they would never retreat in battle (Choice D).  The passage conveys that the Knights Templar ""swore oaths not only of poverty but of chastity, loyalty, and bravery"" (Paragraph 1).  As swearing to never retreat in battle could be part of an oath of bravery, this statement would be consistent with passage information."
"52","In 1187, Jerusalem fell to an opposing army and the Templar capital was moved to Paris, where it would remain until the order was dissolved.  Based on the passage, this information would most reasonably suggest that:","D","10","Nevertheless, these Knights of the Temple—who swore oaths not only of poverty but of chastity, loyalty, and bravery—would eventually become one of the wealthiest and most powerful organizations in the medieval world.  So far-reaching was their strength and acclaim that their destruction must have seemed as sudden and surprising as it was utter and irrevocable.  The signs of danger could not have been wholly invisible, however, as the Templars' growing influence became perceived as a threat to European rulers. (Paragraph 1)
As early as 1128, the Templars even gained official papal recognition, and their wealth, holdings, and numbers swelled both in the Holy Land and throughout Europe, especially in France and England. (Paragraph 2)
However, this growing power contained the seeds of the order's downfall.  Although the Templars were generally held in high esteem, the passage of time saw censure and suspicion directed toward them….  Moreover, their increasingly elevated status brought them into conflict with established authorities. (Paragraph 3)
According to the passage, the Knights Templar grew so strong as an organization that they could rival the power of monarchs.  As Paragraph 1 states: ""So far-reaching was their strength and acclaim that...the Templars' growing influence became perceived as a threat to European rulers.""  Paragraph 2 further describes the Templars' ascendance, specifying that ""their wealth, holdings, and numbers swelled…especially in France and England.""  Likewise, Paragraph 3 conveys that the Templars' ""growing power"" caused tension as ""their increasingly elevated status brought them into conflict with established authorities.""
Therefore, the passage indicates both that the Templars' strength could challenge that of European rulers and also that their forces were most concentrated in France and England.  Accordingly, the fact that the Templar capital was located in Paris suggests that French rulers would have been the group most threatened by Templar power.  Consequently, this information would most reasonably suggest that the Templars would have seemed particularly dangerous to Philip the Fair.
  (Choices A and C)  the number of recruits to the Templar Order began to decline; and fewer knights were willing to embark on crusades.  Since the Templars ""took an oath to defend the Holy Land and any pilgrims who journeyed there after the First Crusade"" (Paragraph 2), the fall of Jerusalem would have constituted a significant loss.  However, that loss would not necessarily mean that the Templars suffered a decline in recruitment or that fewer knights were willing to embark on crusades.  For instance, it is possible that the desire to reclaim Jerusalem would have inspired even greater support for the Templar cause.
Moreover, Paragraph 1 indicates that the Templars were still a powerful organization when their order fell: ""So far-reaching was their strength and acclaim that their destruction must have seemed as sudden and surprising as it was utter and irrevocable.""  Accordingly, the Templars must have maintained or increased their strength over time, suggesting that there was no lack of recruits or enthusiasm for their mission.
(Choice B)  European nations abandoned their goal of controlling the Holy Land.  Paragraph 4 states that ""in 1307…Clement invited the Templar Master, Jacques de Molay, to meet with him on the pretext of organizing a new crusade to retake the Holy Land.""  De Molay's acceptance of the invitation suggests that the prospect of such a crusade was a believable story.  In addition, the fact that the Templar capital remained in Paris does not mean that no attempts were made to retake Jerusalem, only that any such attempts did not succeed.  Therefore, it cannot be concluded that the fall of Jerusalem led European nations to abandon their goal of controlling the Holy Land."
"53","Which of the following items of passage information most clearly indicates that the author believes the Templars were innocent of the accusations against them?","B","10","Shortly thereafter, Philip's forces arrested de Molay and his knights on charges the preponderance of which were almost certainly fabricated.  Ranging from the mundane to the unspeakably perverse, the accusations even included an incredible entry citing ""every crime and abomination that can be committed.""  Suffering tortures nearly as horrific as the acts of which they were accused, many Templars confessed. (Paragraph 4)
The author describes the eventual downfall of the Templars, but conveys that the accusations against them were probably false.  According to Paragraph 4, ""Philip's forces arrested de Molay and his knights on charges the preponderance of which were almost certainly fabricated.""  Furthermore, in discussing these charges, the author notes: ""Ranging from the mundane to the unspeakably perverse, the accusations even included an incredible entry citing 'every crime and abomination that can be committed'.""
By describing the entry as ""incredible,"" the author highlights the implausibility of the accusation; the idea that the Templars had committed ""'every crime and abomination'"" would be an unreasonable thing to believe.  Hence, the author portrays the fact that the charges ""even included"" such an assertion as evidence that those charges ""were almost certainly fabricated.""  In this way, then, the author indicates that they believe the Templars were innocent.
  By contrast, none of the following items of passage information includes an expression of the author's own view of the charges against the Templars:
The Templars swore oaths of poverty, chastity, loyalty, and bravery (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 1, ""these Knights of the Temple…swore oaths not only of poverty but of chastity, loyalty, and bravery.""  However, even if it is assumed that the Templars of 1307 continued to uphold the values expressed by those oaths, the author never mentions the oaths in connection with the charges against the Templars.
Jacques de Molay declared that the Templars' confessions were lies (Choice C).  De Molay's declaration ""that the Templars' confessions were lies obtained under torture"" (Paragraph 5) would be a historical fact regardless of whether the author believed he was telling the truth.  Hence, the author's own view is not conveyed by the mention of de Molay's assertion in the passage.
The rulers of many countries did not believe the accusations (Choice D).  Paragraph 5 states that ""Edward II of England remained convinced that the accusations were false, a view seemingly shared by other rulers.""  However, this historical information would be true regardless of whether the author agreed or disagreed with those rulers."
"54","Which of the following passage claims most strongly supports the assertion that the Templars' influence seemed threatening to European rulers?","B","10","So far-reaching was their strength and acclaim that their destruction must have seemed as sudden and surprising as it was utter and irrevocable.  The signs of danger could not have been wholly invisible, however, as the Templars' growing influence became perceived as a threat to European rulers. (Paragraph 1)
Moreover, their increasingly elevated status brought them into conflict with established authorities.  One revealing example occurred in 1252 when, because of the Templars' ""many liberties"" as well as their ""pride and haughtiness,"" England's King Henry III proposed to curb the order's strength by reclaiming some of its possessions.  The Templars' response was unambiguous: ""So long as thou dost exercise justice thou wilt reign; but if thou infringe it, thou wilt cease to be King!"" (Paragraph 3)
The passage conveys that the Templar Order became so powerful over time that many leaders began to view it with concern.  For instance, Paragraph 1 states that ""the Templars' growing influence became perceived as a threat to European rulers,"" and Paragraph 3 notes that the Templars' ""increasingly elevated status brought them into conflict with established authorities.""
The author then provides an example of such a conflict in which the Templars demonstrated their superiority.  According to Paragraph 3, ""[B]ecause of the Templars' 'many liberties' as well as their 'pride and haughtiness,' England's King Henry III proposed to curb the order's strength by reclaiming some of its possessions.  The Templars' response was unambiguous: 'So long as thou dost exercise justice thou wilt reign; but if thou infringe it, thou wilt cease to be King!'""
This example shows the Knights Templar not only successfully resisting the will of a monarch but threatening to remove that monarch from power if he continued to challenge them.  Thus, based on this occurrence, Henry III and other leaders would have been right to fear the Templars' power.  Consequently, the passage claim that the Templars defied the attempted reforms of Henry III best supports the assertion that the Templars' influence seemed threatening to European rulers.
  By contrast, none of the following passage claims shows the Templars threatening a ruler:
Nobles throughout Europe provided money to the Order (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 2, the Templar Order ""quickly attracted widespread admiration….  Within a year of its founding, the order received a financial endowment from the deeply impressed Count of Anjou, whose example was soon followed by other nobles and monarchs.""  Therefore, although nobles throughout Europe did provide money to the Templar Order, this financial support was because of their admiration for the Templars, not because they felt threatened by the Templars' influence.
The Templars were absorbing crusaders and other knights into their ranks (Choice C).  Paragraph 2 states that the Templars ""quickly attracted widespread admiration as well as many recruits from crusaders and other knights.""  Moreover, they ""even gained official papal recognition, and their wealth, holdings, and numbers swelled.""  However, although this information indicates that the Templar Order grew in manpower, it does not reveal any conflict between the Templars and European rulers.
Clement V conspired to condemn the Templars on false charges (Choice D).  Although the passage describes how Clement V helped to orchestrate the Templars' destruction, it does not portray him as acting from fear.  Rather, Paragraph 4 states: ""Conspiring to seize the order's wealth, Clement invited the Templar Master, Jacques de Molay, to meet with him on the pretext of organizing a new crusade to retake the Holy Land.""  Therefore, while it is possible that Clement felt threatened by the Templars, the passage indicates only that he was motivated by greed for the Templars' wealth."
"55","The author's main point is that the Knights Templar:","C","10","Nevertheless, these Knights of the Temple—who swore oaths not only of poverty but of chastity, loyalty, and bravery—would eventually become one of the wealthiest and most powerful organizations in the medieval world.  So far-reaching was their strength and acclaim that their destruction must have seemed as sudden and surprising as it was utter and irrevocable.  The signs of danger could not have been wholly invisible, however, as the Templars' growing influence became perceived as a threat to European rulers. (Paragraph 1)
However, this growing power contained the seeds of the order's downfall....  Moreover, their increasingly elevated status brought them into conflict with established authorities. (Paragraph 3)
Ultimately, the impoverished Philip the Fair of France joined forces with Pope Clement V to engineer the Templars' downfall beginning in 1307.  Conspiring to seize the order's wealth, Clement invited the Templar Master, Jacques de Molay, to meet with him on the pretext of organizing a new crusade to retake the Holy Land.  Shortly thereafter, Philip's forces arrested de Molay and his knights on charges the preponderance of which were almost certainly fabricated. (Paragraph 4)
By 1313, the Templar Order had been dissolved by papal decree, and many of its members were dead.  The following year, Jacques de Molay was burned at the stake after declaring that the Templars' confessions were lies obtained under torture. (Paragraph 5)
A consistent theme throughout the passage is that the Templars' own great strength would eventually be their undoing.  Although they became ""one of the wealthiest and most powerful organizations in the medieval world,"" the Templars would later experience ""utter and irrevocable"" destruction after their ""growing influence became perceived as a threat to European rulers"" (Paragraph 1).  The rest of the passage elaborates on this point.  For instance, Paragraph 3 notes that the Templars' ""growing power contained the seeds of the order's downfall"" as ""their increasingly elevated status brought them into conflict with established authorities.""
Such conflict would ultimately prove fatal, as ""the impoverished Philip the Fair of France joined forces with Pope Clement V to engineer the Templars' downfall in 1307.  Conspiring to seize the order's wealth…Philip's forces arrested de Molay and his knights"" (Paragraph 4).  The Templars would never recover from this attack: ""By 1313, the Templar Order had been dissolved by papal decree, and many of its members were dead"" (Paragraph 5).
Therefore, the passage describes both how the Knights Templar gained great power and wealth, and how those assets eventually motivated rulers in Europe to betray and destroy them.  Consequently, the author's main point is that the Knights Templar possessed great power as an organization, which ironically brought them to ruin.
  (Choice A)  grew to possess power far beyond what might be expected from their humble beginnings.  Paragraph 1 mentions ""the order's poverty at its inception in 1119"" and notes that, despite these humble beginnings, the Templars ""would eventually become one of the wealthiest and most powerful organizations in the medieval world.""  However, the author goes beyond this point to discuss the further effects of that accumulating power and wealth.  Specifically, the passage stresses that the Templars would ultimately meet their end because their ""growing influence became perceived as a threat to European rulers.""
(Choice B)  were actually a more powerful force in Europe than they were in the Holy Land.  According to the passage, the Templars' ""wealth, holdings, and numbers swelled both in the Holy Land and throughout Europe, especially in France and England"" (Paragraph 2).  However, the author's main point also includes the idea that the Templars' assets in Europe led to their downfall, as ""the impoverished Philip the Fair of France joined forces with Pope Clement V to…seize the order's wealth"" (Paragraph 4).
(Choice D)  possessed sufficient power to challenge the rule of monarchs.  According to the passage, the Knights Templar became so strong that their power rivaled that of established authorities.  For instance, Paragraph 3 describes the Templars resisting the will of England's King Henry III, who had ""proposed to curb the order's strength by reclaiming some of its possessions.""  However, although the Templars' defiance of Henry shows that they possessed enough power to challenge monarchs, this is one example in the author's larger point that such conflict with rulers would eventually lead to the Templars' destruction."
"56","Passage information indicates that bells are prone to cracking unless foundries achieve:

the correct proportions between the bell's soundbow and its other parts.
a consistent chemical composition in the bell's alloy.","C","11","The study further explains that ""[t]he optimum composition for bell metal was considered to be about 77% copper and 23% tin.  Alloys containing higher amounts of tin are brittle and thus unsuitable for large bells.""  Therefore, it would have seemed plausible at the time that either party could potentially have been responsible for the bell's damage. (Paragraph 2)
In 1960, drillings taken from the Liberty Bell were found to contain about 73% copper and 24% tin, with small amounts of lead and other elements composing the rest of the alloy.  A 1975 analysis using fluorescent X-rays further revealed that the bell's chemical composition varies at different points along its surface, shedding additional light on the reasons for the bell's structural failure. (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 2 cites a study explaining that bells can suffer structural failure based on the proportions of metals used in their construction.  Specifically, ""'[t]he optimum composition for bell metal was considered to be about 77% copper and 23% tin.  Alloys containing higher amounts of tin are brittle and thus unsuitable for large bells.'""  Therefore, the passage indicates that unless foundries achieve the proper ratio between metals used to cast the bell, the bell may be too brittle and thus run the risk of cracking (Number I).
According to Paragraph 6, in 1975 an ""analysis using fluorescent X-rays"" was conducted on the Liberty Bell.  This analysis ""revealed that the bell's chemical composition varies at different points along its surface,"" indicating that the distribution of metals was inconsistent throughout the bell's alloy.  The author states that this fact ""shed[s] additional light on the reasons for the bell's structural failure.""  Therefore, passage information indicates that a consistent chemical composition in the bell's alloy is important to prevent a bell from cracking (Number III).
 (Number II)  the correct proportions between the bell's soundbow and its other parts.  According to the passage, successful bell-making involves both structural integrity and sound quality.  For instance, Paragraph 3 states: ""In addition to these durability requirements, medieval bell-makers had also identified the correct ratios between the components of a bell to produce the desired tone, based on the thickness of its soundbow.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that these ratios help to create the right kind of sound when the bell is rung, and that this is a separate matter from a bell's ""durability requirements.""  Accordingly, the passage never suggests that a bell would be prone to cracking if those proportions were not achieved, only that it would have an inferior tone."
"57","Which of the following conclusions can most reasonably be drawn from the information presented in the passage?","C","11","In fact, the Whitechapel Foundry of London created the original bell in 1751, at the request of the State House of colonial Philadelphia.  When the bell finally arrived several months later, the assembled onlookers' anticipation turned to horror as it was rung and immediately cracked. (Paragraph 1)
According to Hanson et al. in a metallurgical study, ""Despite the massive appearance of large bells, they are quite fragile, and cracking may result from inferior casting techniques and vibrational stresses produced by improper ringing.""  The study further explains that ""[t]he optimum composition for bell metal was considered to be about 77% copper and 23% tin.  Alloys containing higher amounts of tin are brittle and thus unsuitable for large bells."" (Paragraph 2)
Philadelphia brass workers Pass and Stow were commissioned to recast the cracked contribution from Whitechapel in 1753.  Melting the original bell down, the men added several pounds of copper to strengthen the alloy and prevent another crack. (Paragraph 5)
In 1960, drillings taken from the Liberty Bell were found to contain about 73% copper and 24% tin, with small amounts of lead and other elements composing the rest of the alloy. (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 1, Whitechapel Foundry created a bell for colonial Philadelphia that ""immediately cracked"" when it was rung for the first time.  Paragraph 2 then cites a metallurgical study conveying that ""'cracking may result from inferior casting techniques.'""  The study further explains that for a bell to be structurally strong, it should be composed of ""'about 77% copper and 23% tin.  Alloys containing higher amounts of tin are brittle and thus unsuitable for large bells.'""  Therefore, the passage indicates that if Whitechapel Foundry did not use the correct ratio of copper to tin, the original bell would have been brittle and likely to crack (as in fact it did).
Paragraph 5 later describes how the brass workers ""Pass and Stow…recast the cracked contribution from Whitechapel,"" stating that they ""added several pounds of copper to strengthen the alloy and prevent another crack.""  According to Paragraph 6, this infusion of copper resulted in a bell composed of ""73% copper and 24% tin, with small amounts of lead and other elements composing the rest of the alloy.""
Therefore, the passage indicates that the final bell still contained too low a ratio of copper to tin, even after more copper had been added by Pass and Stow.  Consequently, it is clear that the original Whitechapel bell must have had an even lower ratio of copper to tin, rendering that bell brittle.  Based on that information, it is most reasonable to conclude that the original bell's cracking was probably the fault of Whitechapel Foundry.
 (Choice A)  The original bell's cracking should have been predictable in advance.  Paragraph 2 states that when the original bell cracked, ""it would have seemed plausible at the time that either party [Whitechapel Foundry or the Philadelphians] could potentially have been responsible for the bell's damage.""  However, this assertion refers to explaining the bell's cracking after it had already occurred.  The passage never suggests that there were prior reasons to expect or predict that the bell would crack.
(Choices B and D)  Pass and Stow were misguided in adding copper to prevent the new bell from cracking; and The original bell's cracking was probably not the fault of Whitechapel Foundry.  According to Paragraph 2, ""'[t]he optimum composition for bell metal was considered to be about 77% copper and 23% tin.  Alloys containing higher amounts of tin are brittle and thus unsuitable for large bells.'""  However, this ratio between copper and tin was never achieved in either the original bell or the new one.  For instance, even after ""Pass and Stow…added several pounds of copper"" (Paragraph 5) to the original bell metal, the resulting alloy ""contain[ed] about 73% copper and 24% tin"" (Paragraph 6).  Therefore, it is clear that Whitechapel Foundry used too little copper in proportion to tin.  Consequently, the foundry was likely to blame for the bell's original crack, and Pass and Stow were correct to add more copper."
"58","Which of the following statements would most challenge the information given in the passage?","A","11","In the case of the Liberty Bell, Philadelphia brass workers Pass and Stow were commissioned to recast the cracked contribution from Whitechapel in 1753.  Melting the original bell down, the men added several pounds of copper to strengthen the alloy and prevent another crack.  This process was successful but the bell's tone was subpar, so they recast the bell again before it was entered into service.  Its most famous ringing was on July 8, 1776, when its peals announced the signing of the Declaration of Independence.  It was also rung on other significant occasions, including the funeral of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1835, when it cracked once again. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, a new version of the bell was created when ""Philadelphia brass workers Pass and Stow…recast the cracked contribution from Whitechapel in 1753.  Melting the original bell down, the men added several pounds of copper to strengthen the alloy and prevent another crack.""  The passage goes on to indicate that although this recasting process seemed to have gone well, ""the bell's tone was subpar, so they recast the bell again before it was entered into service.""  For several decades afterward, the new bell was ""rung on…significant occasions, including the funeral of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1835, when it cracked once again.""
Therefore, the passage conveys that although there were issues with the bell's tone after its initial recasting by Pass and Stow, the bell did not crack again until 1835.  Consequently, the information in the passage would be most challenged if the later Pass and Stow version of the Liberty Bell cracked during tests performed just after its first recasting.
 By contrast, none of the following statements would challenge passage information:
The later Pass and Stow version of the Liberty Bell included an inscription on its shoulder about proclaiming liberty (Choice B).  Paragraph 1 conveys that ""[w]hat would later be known as the Liberty Bell initially had no specific connection to American freedom.  In fact, the Whitechapel Foundry of London created the original bell in 1751.""  However, Paragraph 5 explains that this original bell was later melted down to create a new one, as ""Philadelphia brass workers Pass and Stow were commissioned to recast the cracked contribution from Whitechapel in 1753.""  Accordingly, if this later version of the Liberty Bell included an inscription about proclaiming freedom, that would not challenge passage information about the original version of the bell.
The original Whitechapel version of the Liberty Bell had a similar copper-to-tin ratio as other defective bells (Choice C).  Paragraph 2 indicates that a bell's structural integrity depends on its ratio of copper to tin: ""'[t]he optimum composition for bell metal was considered to be about 77% copper and 23% tin.  Alloys containing higher amounts of tin are brittle and thus unsuitable for large bells.'""  Accordingly, if the original Whitechapel version of the Liberty Bell had a similar ratio to other defective bells, this fact would be consistent with passage information.
The original Whitechapel version of the Liberty Bell remained undamaged throughout its journey from London to Philadelphia (Choice D).  After the original bell cracked, ""[t]he Philadelphians accused the Whitechapel Foundry of poor workmanship, while Foundry workers countered that the Philadelphians caused the crack by ringing the bell incorrectly"" (Paragraph 1).  However, the passage never suggests an additional possibility that the bell was damaged during its trip from London to Philadelphia."
"59","The description of medieval bell-making in Paragraph 3 most supports the passage claim that:","A","11","According to Hanson et al. in a metallurgical study….  ""[t]he optimum composition for bell metal was considered to be about 77% copper and 23% tin. (Paragraph 2)
The above ratio of metals comports fairly closely with knowledge from hundreds of years prior, as a twelfth-century set of instructions specifies that bells should be composed of four parts copper and one part tin to possess sufficient structural integrity.  In addition to these durability requirements, medieval bell-makers had also identified the correct ratios between the components of a bell to produce the desired tone, based on the thickness of its soundbow, the area struck by the bell's clapper.  The diameter of the bell's mouth should be fifteen times the thickness of the soundbow, and its upper portion or shoulder seven and a half times that thickness. (Paragraph 3)
Thus, aside from minor refinements, the process of casting large bells has remained relatively unchanged for centuries. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 2 explains that when the Liberty Bell was made, ""'[t]he optimum composition for bell metal was considered to be about 77% copper and 23% tin.'""  According to Paragraph 3, that ratio of copper to tin ""comports fairly closely with knowledge from hundreds of years prior, as a twelfth-century set of instructions specifies that bells should be composed of four parts copper and one part tin to possess sufficient structural integrity.""  Therefore, the proper composition of bell metal had been basically understood for centuries.
Paragraph 3 then describes another aspect of bell-making that had long been known: ""medieval bell-makers had also identified the correct ratios between the components of a bell to produce the desired tone, based on the thickness of its soundbow.""  Thus, both of these crucial aspects of bell-making had been largely understood since the middle ages.  Accordingly, the author asserts that ""the process of casting large bells has remained relatively unchanged for centuries"" (Paragraph 4).
Therefore, the description of medieval bell-making in Paragraph 3 most supports the passage claim that the process of casting large bells had long been a well-established craft.
 (Choice B)  The bell from Whitechapel Foundry may have been cast using inferior techniques.  Paragraph 1 states that ""[t]he Philadelphians accused the Whitechapel Foundry of poor workmanship"" after the bell cracked.  Paragraph 2 then explains that ""large bells…are quite fragile, and cracking may result from inferior casting techniques.""  Based on this information alone, one might speculate that Whitechapel Foundry used inferior casting techniques when producing the bell for Philadelphia.  However, such a conclusion is neither supported nor challenged by the description of medieval bell-making in Paragraph 3, which provides no information about the quality of work performed by Whitechapel Foundry.
(Choice C)  The bell-making process results in bells that are massive but surprisingly fragile.  Paragraph 2 explains that ""'[d]espite the massive appearance of large bells, they are quite fragile.'""  However, although the description of medieval bell-making in Paragraph 3 discusses some aspects of the craft, it does not mention the fragility of large bells.
(Choice D)  77% copper and 23% tin constitutes the ideal ratio for bell metal.  According to Paragraph 3, this proportion ""comports fairly closely"" with medieval instructions that ""bells should be composed of four parts copper and one part tin.""  Therefore, these instructions recommend approximately, but not exactly, the 77% to 23% ratio described in Paragraph 2.  Moreover, Paragraph 3 goes on to discuss how ""medieval bell-makers had also identified the correct ratios between the components of a bell to produce the desired tone,"" illustrating another facet of bell-making that had been understood for centuries.  Accordingly, although Paragraph 3 provides some support for a specific 77% to 23% ratio being ideal, it more strongly supports the general claim that the process of casting large bells had long been a well-established craft."
"60","Which of the following questions about making the Liberty Bell is NOT addressed by the passage author?","D","11","What would later be known as the Liberty Bell initially had no specific connection to American freedom.

The Philadelphians accused the Whitechapel Foundry of poor workmanship, while Foundry workers countered that the Philadelphians caused the crack by ringing the bell incorrectly. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 discusses ""[w]hat would later be known as the Liberty Bell"" and notes that ""the Whitechapel Foundry of London created the original bell in 1751, at the request of the State House of colonial Philadelphia.""  However, the author never explains why the Philadelphians asked Whitechapel Foundry to produce the bell, nor why they did not select an American foundry.
 By contrast, the passage author provides additional information addressing all of the following questions:
Why did the final bell crack, despite the steps Pass and Stow took to strengthen its alloy? (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 6, an analysis conducted in 1975 ""revealed that the bell's chemical composition varies at different points along its surface, shedding additional light on the reasons for the bell's structural failure.""  Therefore, the author indicates that the uneven distribution of metals in the final bell's alloy contributed to causing the bell to crack.
Why did the bell come to represent American freedom, when it had originally been made in England? (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 5, the bell became connected to American freedom ""on July 8, 1776, when its peals announced the signing of the Declaration of Independence.""  In addition, Paragraph 6 explains that ""[i]n the years before the Civil War, abolitionists (opponents of slavery) adopted the 'Liberty Bell' as a symbol representing liberation (i.e., freedom) from slavery.""
Why would the bell's core and cope have been made as separate pieces, instead of as a single mould? (Choice C).  Paragraph 4 describes ""the process of casting large bells,"" stating that ""[a]n inner mould or core is constructed of brick, then covered with clay, animal hair, and manure.  The core is wound with rope, which, when later removed, creates the space for the metal.  The cope or outer mould is shaped around the core.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that the core and cope are made separately to allow the rope to be removed (creating space to pour the metal) once the correct shapes for the moulds have been produced."
"61","According to the author, Shang oracle bone inscriptions were used for which of the following purposes?
I. Invoking spiritual powers
II. Guiding behavior
III. Determining the next king","C","12","These inscriptions reveal several aspects of Shang spiritual practice, which was dominated by attempts to divine the future and to secure the aid of various natural and supernatural powers. (Paragraph 1)
The term ""oracle bone inscriptions"" derives from the method the Shang used to seek guidance from the spiritual world.  An animal bone, most commonly a tortoise shell or cow scapula, would be inscribed with a statement, such as ""on the tenth day, there will be rain"" or ""we should go to battle.""  The shell or bone was then exposed to a heated piece of metal, and the king would interpret the resulting cracks as either affirming or denying the inscription. (Paragraph 2)
Because of this seeming ambivalence, the Shang instead sought to incur Di's favor through the intercession of their deceased kings.  While these kings were not as powerful as Di, they could bestow some measure of blessing (or bane) upon the living ruler and his subjects. (Paragraph 5)
A third group of powers comprised natural spirits, such as the Yellow River Power or the Great Winds.  These forces lacked the direct control over events that Di possessed; however, they did have some influence over natural phenomena.  Hence, both for such powers and for the ancestor kings, some oracle bone inscriptions described a wish and an attempt to gain an entity's favor; for example, ""to the Mountain we pray for rain and offer a burnt sacrifice."" (Paragraph 6)
In Paragraph 1, the author describes ""Shang spiritual practice, which was dominated by attempts to…secure the aid of various natural and supernatural powers.""  The passage later provides more details about those spiritual powers, such as the Shang's ""deceased kings,"" who ""could bestow some measure of blessing (or bane) upon the living ruler and his subjects"" (Paragraph 5).  Likewise, Paragraph 6 identifies ""natural spirits"" that possessed ""influence over natural phenomena.""  The author then notes that with both groups, ""some oracle bone inscriptions described a wish and an attempt to gain an entity's favor.""  Therefore, those inscriptions were used for invoking spiritual powers (Number I).
Paragraph 2 discusses how the Shang used oracle bone inscriptions ""to seek guidance from the spiritual world.""  As the author explains, ""An animal bone, most commonly a tortoise shell or cow scapula, would be inscribed with a statement, such as…'we should go to battle.'""  Then, after exposing the bones to heat, ""the king would interpret the resulting cracks as either affirming or denying the inscription.""  Therefore, the Shang used oracle bone inscriptions to help determine whether a particular action should be taken, thus guiding behavior (Number II).
 (Number III)  Determining the next king.  According to Paragraph 3, one function of the oracle bone inscriptions was to ""legitimize the king's authority.""  When a king was believed to have correctly interpreted the bones and predicted future events, his ""role as an intermediary between the divine and physical realms was therefore reinforced.""  However, this process relates to how the current king was perceived, not to how the next king was selected.  Moreover, the passage does not discuss how the Shang selected new kings.  Accordingly, the author never suggests that oracle bone inscriptions were used for determining the next king."
"62","Which of the following conclusions about the Shang dynasty can be drawn from the information in the passage?","B","12","The earliest documentation of Chinese religious belief comes from the oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang dynasty, which, intriguingly, the newest archaeological evidence has now dated to approximately 1554–1040 B.C.E.  These inscriptions reveal several aspects of Shang spiritual practice, which was dominated by attempts to divine the future and to secure the aid of various natural and supernatural powers. (Paragraph 1)
When the author first mentions the Shang dynasty in Paragraph 1, he or she states that ""intriguingly, the newest archaeological evidence has now dated [it] to approximately 1554–1040 B.C.E.""  By specifying that this time period is based on ""the newest archaeological evidence"" and how that evidence ""has now dated"" the dynasty, the author implies that prior evidence had suggested a different time span.  Accordingly, it can be concluded from passage information that the Shang dynasty was originally believed to have spanned a different time period in China's history.
 (Choice A)  It was extremely reverential toward certain animals.  Paragraph 2 describes how the Shang practiced divination using oracle bone inscriptions, ""most commonly [using] a tortoise shell or cow scapula.""  However, the passage never explains why the bones of tortoises and cows were most commonly used, nor suggests that those animals (or any others) were revered by the Shang.  For instance, those bones could have simply been the most widely available and convenient.  Therefore, it cannot be concluded from passage information that the Shang were reverential toward any animals.
(Choice C)  It was an era of greater spiritual concern than any other period in Chinese history.  According to Paragraph 7, ""The frequency and prominence of oracle bone inscriptions, as well as their emphasis on the role of divine forces, evince (make evident) a high degree of spiritual concern in the time of the Shang dynasty.""  Thus, the passage indicates that the Shang dynasty was an era of great spiritual concern.  However, the author never discusses the level of spiritual concern in other periods of Chinese history, nor draws a comparison between such periods and the Shang.  Accordingly, it cannot be concluded from the passage that spiritual concern was greater during the Shang dynasty than at any other time in China's history.
(Choice D)  It was the first time in Chinese history in which any religious practices occurred.  According to Paragraph 1, ""The earliest documentation of Chinese religious belief comes from the oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang dynasty.""  However, the fact that the earliest documentation of Chinese religion comes from the Shang dynasty means only that there are no earlier historical records of Chinese religious practices.  Such practices could still have occurred in earlier times even if no records of them exist."
"63","In some scholars' studies of oracle bones, the inscriptions are viewed as statements to be confirmed, but in other scholars' studies of oracle bones, the inscriptions are viewed as questions to be answered.  This information:","C","12","The earliest documentation of Chinese religious belief comes from the oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang dynasty, which, intriguingly, the newest archaeological evidence has now dated to approximately 1554–1040 B.C.E.

An animal bone, most commonly a tortoise shell or cow scapula, would be inscribed with a statement, such as ""on the tenth day, there will be rain"" or ""we should go to battle."" (Paragraph 2)
Four days later, the pronouncement was viewed as confirmed when a messenger reported attacks on two settlements.  The king's important role as an intermediary between the divine and physical realms was therefore reinforced. (Paragraph 3)
A third group of powers comprised natural spirits, such as the Yellow River Power or the Great Winds.  These forces lacked the direct control over events that Di possessed; however, they did have some influence over natural phenomena.  Hence, both for such powers and for the ancestor kings, some oracle bone inscriptions described a wish and an attempt to gain an entity's favor; for example, ""to the Mountain we pray for rain and offer a burnt sacrifice."" (Paragraph 6)
The passage author's main point concerns the connection between oracle bone inscriptions and the spiritual life of the Shang dynasty.  According to Paragraph 1, the inscriptions ""reveal several aspects of Shang spiritual practice, which was dominated by attempts to divine the future and to secure the aid of various natural and supernatural powers.""  This claim serves as a thesis for the passage, which describes these different aspects of Shang religion.
For instance, the Shang used the inscriptions ""to seek guidance from the spiritual world"" (Paragraph 2), and to reinforce ""[t]he king's important role as an intermediary between the divine and physical realms"" (Paragraph 3).  In addition, the Shang sought the aid of powers such as ""natural spirits"" and ""ancestor kings,"" which were believed capable of influencing events in beneficial or detrimental ways (Paragraph 6).
However, none of these descriptions would be affected by whether the oracle bone inscriptions are statements or questions.  For example, there is no real difference between affirming or denying the statement ""'on the tenth day, there will be rain'"" (Paragraph 2) versus receiving an answer to the question ""on the tenth day, will there be rain?""  In either case, the inscription is being used to seek guidance in order to predict the future and determine the best course of action.  Similarly, in either case the spiritual powers would bear the same relationship to China's welfare.
Therefore, the fact that scholars disagree on whether the inscriptions represent statements or questions does not significantly affect the passage author's main point.
 (Choices A and D)  undermines the passage author's main point; and strengthens the passage author's main point.  Whether the inscriptions represent questions to be answered or statements to be affirmed or denied, the function of the oracle bone inscriptions and the role ascribed to the spiritual powers would still be the same.  Therefore, this possibility would neither undermine nor strengthen the passage author's main point.
(Choice B)  shows the passage author made an oversight in presenting his or her main point.  Even if some scholars believe the inscriptions were questions, the failure to acknowledge that fact is not necessarily an oversight.  For instance, if the passage author believes the evidence favors viewing the inscriptions as statements, he or she may have intentionally ignored the alternative view."
"64","The author does NOT provide any information to help explain:","A","12","The term ""oracle bone inscriptions"" derives from the method the Shang used to seek guidance from the spiritual world.

The shell or bone was then exposed to a heated piece of metal, and the king would interpret the resulting cracks as either affirming or denying the inscription.  Usually, the king's pronouncement would then be recorded. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 discusses how the Shang used oracle bone inscriptions to seek spiritual guidance.  According to the author, ""An animal bone…would be inscribed with a statement, such as 'on the tenth day, there will be rain' or 'we should go to battle.'  The shell or bone was then exposed to a heated piece of metal, and the king would interpret the resulting cracks as either affirming or denying the inscription.""
However, although the passage states that the king would interpret the cracks in the bones, the author never explains any details or methods behind this interpretation.  For instance, he or she does not discuss how a particular crack would be seen as affirming or denying the inscribed statement.  Accordingly, the author does not provide any information to help explain the criteria the Shang used to interpret oracle bones.
 (Choice B)  the role played by natural spirits in Shang religious belief.  Paragraph 6 describes the Shang's conception of ""natural spirits, such as the Yellow River Power or the Great Winds.  These forces… [had] some influence over natural phenomena.""  Accordingly, the author indicates that in Shang religious belief, such spirits played a role in influencing the course of natural events.
(Choice C)  the methods the Shang employed to gain favor from spiritual powers.  In Paragraph 6, the author conveys that the Shang would seek blessings from natural spirits and deceased former kings.  As a result, ""some oracle bone inscriptions described a wish and an attempt to gain an entity's favor; for example, 'to the Mountain we pray for rain and offer a burnt sacrifice.'""  Therefore, the author indicates that the Shang would make sacrifices as a method of gaining favor from spiritual powers.
(Choice D)  the reasons why the Shang viewed Di as ambivalent.  According to Paragraph 5, although Di was ""the high god of the Shang,"" he did not reliably act to benefit the Shang people and sometimes acted against them.  For instance, both positive and negative occurrences were attributed to Di, who might ""send or withhold rain and wind, bring fortune or misfortune upon the land, grant military assistance, or even induce other peoples to attack China.""  As such, ""Di was viewed as distant from the people and willing to harm as well as aid them throughout various times.""  Hence, this conception of Di as sometimes aiding the Shang but sometimes increasing their hardships explains his ""seeming ambivalence."""
"65","Which of the following discoveries would most weaken the author's central point?","B","12","These inscriptions reveal several aspects of Shang spiritual practice, which was dominated by attempts to divine the future and to secure the aid of various natural and supernatural powers. (Paragraph 1)
The term ""oracle bone inscriptions"" derives from the method the Shang used to seek guidance from the spiritual world.  An animal bone…would be inscribed with a statement, such as ""on the tenth day, there will be rain"" or ""we should go to battle.""  The shell or bone was then exposed to a heated piece of metal, and the king would interpret the resulting cracks as either affirming or denying the inscription.  Usually, the king's pronouncement would then be recorded. (Paragraph 2)
However, legitimation of royal authority could not have been the only function of the divination process, as there are a limited number of records in which a king failed to predict the future accurately. (Paragraph 4)
Throughout the passage, the author emphasizes the importance the Shang placed on predicting future events.  According to Paragraph 1, the oracle bone inscriptions ""reveal several aspects of Shang spiritual practice, which was dominated by attempts to divine the future.""  Similarly, the author conveys that the Shang used these inscriptions to ""seek guidance from the spiritual world"" (Paragraph 2) in an effort to ""predict the future accurately"" (Paragraph 4).
However, if it were discovered that the oracle bone inscriptions were records of past decisions rather than prospective actions of Shang kings, the inscriptions would not be part of divining the future or seeking spiritual guidance as the author claims.  Instead, they would merely be descriptions of past events, contradicting much of the information in the passage.  In that case, the author's central point would be severely weakened.
 (Choice A)  The Shang kings sometimes disagreed with their scribes about whether a prediction's results should be recorded.  According to Paragraph 3, ""the outcome of the king's forecast was also inscribed—however, these cases were almost always when the king had been correct in his divination.""  Paragraph 4 later states that correct predictions served as ""legitimation of royal authority"" but adds that ""there are a limited number of records in which a king failed to predict the future accurately.""  Hence, based on the passage, one can easily imagine that the king might not have wanted scribes to record incorrect predictions, as these would have weakened rather than reinforced his ""important role as an intermediary between the divine and physical realms"" (Paragraph 3).
(Choice C)  The oracle bone inscriptions were more prominent in other Chinese dynasties.  Paragraph 7 mentions ""[t]he frequency and prominence of oracle bone inscriptions…in the time of the Shang dynasty.""  However, the author never discusses whether oracle bone inscriptions might have been more prominent in other dynasties.  Moreover, the author states that the Shang's ""practices and beliefs would guide the course of Chinese thought through successive centuries.""  Accordingly, if it were discovered that oracle bones played an even greater role in other dynasties, that could stem from the Shang's influence as described by the author.
(Choice D)  The term ""Di"" referred not to a Shang high god but to any spiritual powers mentioned in the oracle bone inscriptions.  Although such a discovery would undermine the author's claims about a ""high god of the Shang"" (Paragraph 5), it would not significantly weaken his or her central point about how the Shang would ""seek guidance from the spiritual world"" (Paragraph 2).  For instance, even if ""Di"" refers to spiritual powers in general rather than a high god, the oracle bone inscriptions would still be part of a ""divination process…to predict the future"" (Paragraph 4).  Similarly, the Shang would still have made appeals to ""their deceased kings"" (Paragraph 5) and to ""natural spirits, such as the Yellow River Power or the Great Winds"" (Paragraph 6).  Hence, while this discovery would challenge one part of the passage, the author's central point would still be preserved."
"66","The author most likely recounts the dream described on the stele to show that:","C","13","Notably, the forepaws of the Sphinx enclose an open temple containing a stele or stone slab.  Dating from circa 1400 BC, the inscription on the stele relates how the god Re appeared in a dream to the young Egyptian prince Thutmose IV, promising that if he dug the Sphinx out of the sand, he would be crowned Pharaoh of Upper and Lower Egypt.  Archaeological evidence confirms that Thutmose not only freed the Sphinx but, having discovered that some of the stones of its body had fallen off, restored them to their proper place and filled in damaged areas.  Lastly, Thutmose had a wall built around the area of the Sphinx, its mudbricks inscribed with his name. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, ""the inscription on the stele relates how the god Re appeared in a dream to the young Egyptian prince Thutmose IV, promising that if he dug the Sphinx out of the sand, he would be crowned Pharaoh of Upper and Lower Egypt.""  Paragraph 4 further states that ""[a]rchaeological evidence confirms that Thutmose not only freed the Sphinx but, having discovered that some of the stones of its body had fallen off, restored them to their proper place and filled in damaged areas.""
This account of Thutmose's restoration efforts shows that the stele's inscription interweaves the historical facts with a dream narrative that includes elements of the supernatural.  Therefore, the author most likely recounts the dream described on the stele to show that a legend (a traditional story loosely based on history) was formed to explain how the Sphinx was restored.
 (Choice A)  ancient inscriptions were fanciful in nature.  Although the stele's inscription of the dream narrative in which ""the god Re appeared in a dream to the young Egyptian prince"" could be considered fanciful or imaginative in nature, the passage does not discuss any other ancient inscriptions.  Therefore, in recounting the dream described on the stele, the author does not show that ancient inscriptions were necessarily fanciful in nature.
(Choice B)  archaeological efforts were generally intended to influence politics.  Paragraph 4 states that ""the inscription on the stele relates how the god Re appeared in a dream to the young Egyptian prince Thutmose IV, promising that if he dug the Sphinx out of the sand, he would be crowned Pharaoh of Upper and Lower Egypt.""  This passage information suggests that Thutmose may have been politically motivated in his excavation efforts, but in recounting the dream described on the stele, the author does not show that archaeological efforts were generally intended to influence politics.
(Choice D)  a supernatural intervention was necessary to save the Sphinx.  Although ""the inscription on the stele relates how the god Re appeared in a dream to the young Egyptian prince Thutmose IV"" (Paragraph 4), the author does not present the supernatural elements of the dream as factual.  Instead, the inscription is part of the ""[a]rchaeological evidence"" confirming that Thutmose freed the Sphinx.  Therefore, in recounting the dream described on the stele, the author does not show that supernatural intervention was necessary to save the Sphinx."
"67","According to the passage, the body of the Sphinx was dug out of the sand on at least 6 different occasions throughout its history.  The passage author would most likely agree that those numerous excavations:","D","13","In 1817, Italian Egyptologist Giovanni Battista Caviglia led the first modern archaeological dig to rescue the monument from the desert sands….  Artifacts from various time periods show that the statue had been dug out no fewer than 6 previous times, the last at the order of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius in AD 160.  However, the Sphinx's body would not be completely freed until French Egyptologist Emile Baraize conducted extensive excavations of the monument and surrounding area in 1926. (Paragraph 1)
Reconstructive efforts on the statue were accelerated and continue to this day, guided by advances in science and technology.  Despite the increased attention, the Sphinx has not yet revealed all its secrets but remains an archaeological riddle. (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 1 relates that ""[a]rtifacts from various time periods show that the statue had been dug out no fewer than 6 previous times, the last at the order of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius in AD 160.""  In Paragraph 6, the author conveys that even today, ""[d]espite the increased attention, the Sphinx has not yet revealed all its secrets but remains an archaeological riddle.""
As this passage evidence indicates, the excavations of the Sphinx at various time periods have left behind artifacts from diverse historical contexts, as well as secrets yet to be revealed.  Consequently, the passage author would most likely conclude that those numerous excavations are a factor that makes research on the Sphinx an interesting undertaking.
 (Choice A)  have had their historical significance diminished by advances in archaeological methods.  Paragraph 6 mentions that ""[r]econstructive efforts on the statue…continue to this day, guided by advances in science and technology.""  However, the passage never implies that these advances in archaeological methods have diminished the historical significance of the earlier excavations of the Sphinx.
(Choice B)  have impeded some of the archaeological research on the Sphinx.  Paragraph 1 mentions that ""[a]rtifacts from various time periods show that the statue had been dug out no fewer than 6 previous times, the last at the order of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius in AD 160.""  Moreover, Paragraph 4 indicates that the ""stele or stone slab"" was an important archaeological artifact for dating the first restoration of the Sphinx by Thutmose to about 1400 BC.  Accordingly, given the success of prior archaeological endeavors in establishing dates and historical facts about the monument, the author would likely conclude that the numerous excavations have not impeded (hindered) but rather facilitated some of the archaeological research on the Sphinx.
(Choice C)  suggest a commonality between the ancient and modern archaeologist.  Paragraph 1 conveys how in 1817, ""Caviglia led the first modern archaeological dig to rescue the monument from the desert sands.…  Artifacts from various time periods show that the statue had been dug out no fewer than 6 previous times, the last at the order of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius in AD 160.""  Paragraph 1 further cites the ""extensive excavations of the monument and surrounding area"" by Emile Baraize in 1926, and Paragraph 4 relates how Thutmose IV restored the Sphinx in 1400 BC.  However, although the passage discusses both modern and ancient archaeological endeavors, it never compares ancient and modern archaeologists.  Therefore, the author would not necessarily conclude that those numerous excavations suggest a commonality between the ancient and modern archaeologist."
"68","For which of the following claims about Egyptology does the author provide the LEAST support in the passage?","C","13","Interestingly, these prodigious stone structures were built not by slaves, as commonly assumed, but by Egyptian civil servants who held a privileged position in society. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 states that ""these prodigious stone structures were built not by slaves, as commonly assumed, but by Egyptian civil servants who held a privileged position in society.""  However, the passage provides no additional evidence or support for the claim that the major monuments of the Giza Plateau were built by civil servants.
 By comparison, the author provides more support for the following claims about Egyptology:
New archaeological theories bred controversy among established researchers (Choice A).  Paragraph 5 describes a controversy about the statue's age, noting that ""[a]n alternative theory dates the original construction of the Sphinx back to 7000 BC or earlier.""  The author then clarifies that ""[s]ome experts claim that wind and sand would not have caused the pattern of erosion seen on the Sphinx's lower body; more likely it was the effect of heavy and repeated rainfalls on the limestone.  While many scholars dispute this theory, geological studies have revealed that the Giza Plateau…was once a rich and fertile plain subject to frequent precipitation.""
The restoration of the Sphinx had increased in urgency and sophistication by the 1990s (Choice B).  Paragraph 6 provides the supporting information that ""in 1988, a piece of the Sphinx's shoulder collapsed onto the ground.  Reconstructive efforts on the statue were accelerated and continue to this day, guided by advances in science and technology.""
Excavations of the Sphinx were planned and carried out prior to the 1800s (Choice D).  Paragraph 1 states that ""[a]rtifacts from various time periods show that the statue had been dug out no fewer than 6 previous times, the last at the order of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius in AD 160.""  Paragraph 4 also cites the stele's inscription ""[d]ating from circa 1400 BC,"" which describes how ""Thutmose…freed (ie, excavated) the Sphinx."""
"69","Which of the following statements most accurately characterizes how the passage depicts Thutmose IV's efforts to preserve the Sphinx?","A","13","Dating from circa 1400 BC, the inscription on the stele relates how the god Re appeared in a dream to the young Egyptian prince Thutmose IV, promising that if he dug the Sphinx out of the sand, he would be crowned Pharaoh of Upper and Lower Egypt.  Archaeological evidence confirms that Thutmose not only freed the Sphinx but, having discovered that some of the stones of its body had fallen off, restored them to their proper place and filled in damaged areas.  Lastly, Thutmose had a wall built around the area of the Sphinx, its mudbricks inscribed with his name. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, ""the inscription on the stele relates how the god Re appeared in a dream to…Thutmose IV, promising that if he dug the Sphinx out of the sand, he would be crowned Pharaoh of Upper and Lower Egypt.  Archaeological evidence confirms that Thutmose not only freed the Sphinx but, having discovered that some of the stones of its body had fallen off, restored them to their proper place and filled in damaged areas.""
Based on this evidence, the statement that most accurately characterizes how the passage depicts Thutmose IV's efforts to preserve the Sphinx is that after the dream, he committed to freeing the Sphinx but also desired to restore it.
 By contrast, none of the following statements accurately characterize how the passage depicts Thutmose's efforts:
On hearing the sun god speak through the Sphinx, he planned to obey the dream (Choice B).  Paragraph 4 states that ""[a]rchaeological evidence confirms that Thutmose…freed the Sphinx.""  However, the passage does not mention whether, on hearing the sun god speak through the Sphinx, Thutmose planned (ie, originally intended) to obey the dream or only later decided to free the monument from the sand.
Once he had ruled Egypt for a while, he decided to restore the body of the Sphinx (Choice C).  Paragraph 4 states that ""[a]rchaeological evidence confirms that Thutmose not only freed the Sphinx but, having discovered that some of the stones of its body had fallen off, restored them to their proper place and filled in damaged areas.""  However, the passage does not make it clear exactly when Thutmose's restoration took place.  Furthermore, the passage depicts Thutmose as not only restoring the Sphinx but having to dig it out of the sand first.
As a result of his devotion to the sun god, Upper and Lower Egypt became unified (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 4, ""the inscription on the stele relates how the god Re appeared in a dream to the young Egyptian prince Thutmose IV, promising that if he dug the Sphinx out of the sand, he would be crowned Pharaoh of Upper and Lower Egypt.""  However, the passage never indicates whether Upper and Lower Egypt actually did become unified as a result of Thutmose's efforts to preserve the Sphinx."
"70","According to the passage, what evidence has led some experts to argue that the erosion on the Sphinx was caused by rainfall?","B","13","An alternative theory dates the original construction of the Sphinx back to 7000 BC or earlier.  Some experts claim that wind and sand would not have caused the pattern of erosion seen on the Sphinx's lower body; more likely, it was the effect of heavy and repeated rainfalls on the limestone.  While many scholars dispute this theory, geological studies have revealed that the Giza Plateau, which sits on the edge of the Sahara Desert, had a few millennia before been a rich and fertile plain subject to frequent precipitation. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, ""[s]ome experts claim that wind and sand would not have caused the pattern of erosion seen on the Sphinx's lower body; more likely, it was the effect of heavy and repeated rainfalls on the limestone.""  This passage statement shows that the type of erosion seen on the Sphinx's surface was more consistent with that caused by rainfall than by wind and sand.  Therefore, that the Sphinx's appearance is less consistent with erosion from wind and sand constitutes evidence that has led some experts to argue that the erosion on the Sphinx was caused by rainfall.
 By contrast, none of the following represents evidence that has led some experts to argue that the erosion on the Sphinx was caused by rainfall:
Rainfall caused damage to the surrounding monuments (Choice A).  Paragraph 3 identifies ""the Great Pyramid, the Causeway, the Sphinx Temple, and the Valley Temple"" as the monuments surrounding the Sphinx on the Giza plateau.  However, the passage does not discuss damage to these surrounding monuments.
The Sphinx is significantly older than the surrounding monuments (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 5, ""[a]n alternative theory dates the original construction of the Sphinx back to 7000 BC,"" which would make it far older than the surrounding monuments.  This theory claims ""wind and sand would not have caused the pattern of erosion seen on the Sphinx's lower body; more likely, it was the effect of heavy and repeated rainfalls on the limestone.""  In addition, ""geological studies have revealed that the Giza Plateau…had a few millennia before been a rich and fertile plain subject to frequent precipitation.""  Therefore, the statement that the Sphinx is older than the surrounding monuments is a hypothesis formulated from information about the erosion on the Sphinx's surface and the geological history of the region; it is not the reason why some believe that the erosion was caused by rainfall.
The region around the Sphinx at one time had abundant rainfall (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 5, ""geological studies have revealed that the Giza Plateau…had a few millennia before been a rich and fertile plain subject to frequent precipitation"" (ie, abundant rainfall).  However, this information merely provides support for the primary evidence of the Sphinx's appearance being more consistent with the effects of rainfall and less consistent with erosion from wind and sand."
"71","According to the passage, Heidegger believed that both the revered triumvirate and Descartes:","C","14","In this tortured and intimidating tome, Heidegger…dared to target the lofty towers of traditional Western metaphysical thought.  Above all, he believed that the revered triumvirate of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle had diverted the course of philosophy by turning away from ontology, or the study of Being, toward a metaphysics that merely pondered the nature of individual entities.  Furthermore, Heidegger thought that Descartes, as the first modern philosopher, had exacerbated this misguided focus. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, Heidegger ""believed that the revered triumvirate…had diverted the course of philosophy by turning away from ontology, or the study of Being, toward a metaphysics that merely pondered the nature of individual entities.""  Furthermore, Heidegger believed that ""Descartes…had exacerbated (made worse) this misguided focus.""
This information shows that, in Heidegger's view, the revered triumvirate (Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle) and, later, Descartes were concerned with certain metaphysical issues but neglected issues of Being or ontology—the very issues Heidegger considered most fundamental.  Therefore, according to the passage, Heidegger believed that both the revered triumvirate and Descartes disregarded the relevance of ontological issues to metaphysical studies.
 (Choices A and D) diverged from the approaches to metaphysics that prevailed; and developed theories that were long suppressed.  According to Paragraph 2, ""Heidegger…dared to target the lofty towers of traditional Western metaphysical thought.""  In particular, he ""believed that the revered triumvirate…had diverted the course of philosophy by turning away from ontology…toward a metaphysics that merely pondered the nature of individual entities.""  Moreover, in Heidegger's view, ""Descartes, as the first modern philosopher had exacerbated this misguided focus.""  Accordingly, the evidence shows that the revered triumvirate and Descartes exemplified—and in fact, instituted—the metaphysical approaches that became traditional or prevailed in the West.  Likewise, this information indicates that the theories of these thinkers were not suppressed but became mainstream.
(Choice B) adapted their philosophical principles to embrace everyday issues.  Paragraph 2 states that ""Heidegger believed that the revered triumvirate…had diverted…from ontology…toward a metaphysics that merely pondered the nature of individual entities.""  Furthermore, Descartes ""had exacerbated this misguided focus.""  By contrast, Heidegger diverged from the approach of his predecessors and deliberately focused on ""ordinary, everyday experience"" (Paragraph 2).  Accordingly, the passage never indicates that either the revered triumvirate or Descartes adapted philosophical principles to embrace everyday issues."
"72","Based on the passage, Heidegger's main purpose in Being and Time is to:
show the everyday world and metaphysical concerns as essentially irreconcilable.
use extraordinary as opposed to ordinary language to express his ideas more accurately.
try to derive knowledge of Being through its fundamentally human dimension.","C","14","Heidegger tackled such questions in Being and Time….  He also began his quest for the meaning of Being with ordinary, everyday experience, with what it means to dwell within the world as a human being—the only being sufficiently aware of its own existence to question it. (Paragraph 2)
Accordingly, Heidegger sought to gain an understanding of Being by analyzing the inherent structures of our basic ontological condition, the reality of our distinctively human existence or mode of Being, which he referred to as Dasein—a term roughly translated as ""being there."" (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 2, Heidegger ""began his quest for the meaning of Being with ordinary, everyday experience, with what it means to dwell within the world as a human being.""  Paragraph 3 then describes Heidegger's approach to this quest: he ""sought to gain an understanding of Being by analyzing the inherent structures of our basic ontological condition, the reality of our distinctively human existence or mode of Being, which he referred to as Dasein…'being there.'""  Therefore, based on the passage, Heidegger's main purpose in Being and Time is to try to derive knowledge of Being through its fundamentally human dimension, or what he referred to as Dasein (Number III).
 (Number I) show the everyday world and metaphysical concerns as essentially irreconcilable.  As Paragraph 2 indicates, ""Heidegger began his quest for the meaning of Being with ordinary, everyday experience"" in order to direct Western metaphysical thought back to issues of Being.  Paragraph 5 later reveals that ""in trying to 'call us back to the remembrance of Being'…Heidegger pitched ordinary experience into the ontological register, grounding metaphysics in everyday reality.""  Accordingly, this information indicates that Heidegger viewed the everyday world and metaphysical concerns as reconcilable (compatible) rather than irreconcilable.
(Number II) use extraordinary as opposed to ordinary language to express his ideas more accurately.  According to Paragraph 2, ""In this tortured and intimidating tome, Heidegger strung words into hyphenated chains to build terms better befitting his dense ideas and dared to target the lofty towers of traditional Western metaphysical thought.""  Consequently, Heidegger used extraordinary as opposed to ordinary language to try to articulate his ideas in Being and Time more precisely.  However, rather than being Heidegger's main purpose, this use of language is merely a means of expressing the ideas involved in his primary task of deriving knowledge of Being."
"73","The passage does NOT imply which of the following claims about Heidegger's concept of Dasein?","A","14","Heidegger saw Dasein's primary structure as ""thrownness"": we are summarily tossed into the world and into a particular configuration of circumstances that impose limitations but also provide possibilities.  Overall, we belong to a world that is exquisitely attuned to us and toward which we, in turn, are uniquely disposed.  This existential condition of ""being-in-the-world"" implies complete engagement with our environment: we are inextricably entangled and deeply invested in its intricate web of people and things. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, ""Heidegger saw Dasein's primary structure as 'thrownness': we are summarily tossed into the world and into a particular configuration of circumstances that impose limitations but also provide possibilities.""  As Paragraph 3 explains, ""[W]e belong to a world that is exquisitely attuned to us and toward which we…are uniquely disposed.""  Furthermore, ""[t]his existential condition of 'being-in-the-world' implies…[that] we are inextricably entangled and deeply invested in its intricate web of people and things.""
This evidence indicates that, for Heidegger, our condition of ""thrownness"" offers us some choice and is fundamentally in tune with our needs.  Nevertheless, ""thrownness"" is ultimately an unchangeable and inescapable, condition.  Therefore, the passage does not imply that Dasein represents a process of overcoming ""thrownness.""
 By contrast, the passage does imply each of the following claims about the concept of Dasein:
Dasein is shaped through overlapping subcontexts of meaning (Choice B).  Paragraph 3 states that ""[i]n the day-to-day business of living, we play shifting roles within countless contexts and subcontexts that form an interactive, seamlessly integrated totality of which we are the co-creators.""  For instance, a boat ""functions primarily as a piece of equipment within a nexus (connected group) of related such items""; furthermore, it ""operates within many possible domains…and might be utilized…by diverse individuals"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, through daily encounters, Dasein interacts with different entities and participates in different activities within various, ever-larger contexts of meaning.
Dasein is uniquely characterized by existential introspection (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 2, Heidegger considered the human being ""the only being sufficiently aware of its own existence to question it.""  Accordingly, this information indicates that humans (who, enmeshed with the world, constitute Dasein) alone among all beings have a natural capacity to think or introspect about their own existence.
Dasein is informed by a nondualistic perspective of reality (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 2, ""While this Cartesian paradigm (model) effectively severed self from world and subject from object, Heidegger adopted a nondualistic, phenomenological approach wherein perceiver and perceived are interdependent.""  Furthermore, ""Heidegger sought to gain an understanding of Being by analyzing…the reality of our distinctively human existence or mode of Being, which he referred to as Dasein…'being there'"" (Paragraph 3).  Consequently, in exploring the concept of Dasein, Heidegger would have adopted a nondualistic approach."
"74","Given the information in the passage, it can be concluded that Heidegger views objects like hammers and boats as:","B","14","Consequently, we are interconnected not only socially but ""equipmentally.""  The world is filled with objects we can manipulate for a variety of purposes.  For example, a hammer is typically not an object we stop and analyze but a tool we pick up and use, experiencing it more as an extension of our hand than an ontologically distinct entity.  Therefore, the hammer's common mode of Being is usefulness—in Heideggerian terminology, it is ""ready-to-hand"" rather than merely ""present-at-hand.""  Likewise, a boat on the water is only secondarily an object for observation and interpretation.  It functions primarily as a piece of equipment within a nexus of related such items that might include oars, fishing tackle, and life preservers.  Furthermore, the vessel operates within many possible domains—boatbuilding, fish markets, travel—and might be utilized in sundry activities by diverse individuals. (Paragraph 4)
In Heidegger's view, ""[t]he world is filled with objects we can manipulate for a variety of purposes"" (Paragraph 4).  He notes that ""a hammer is typically not an object we stop and analyze but a tool we pick up and use.""  Furthermore, like the hammer, ""a boat…is only secondarily an object for observation and interpretation...[and] functions primarily as a piece of equipment within a nexus (connected group) of related such items.""  The boat also ""operates within many possible domains…and might be utilized…by diverse individuals.""
This evidence reveals that, for Heidegger, an item's specific function depends on the context in which it is encountered, the purpose for which it is used, and those who use it.  Accordingly, the object's function is modified based on the role it plays in the various shifting and interconnected contexts of Dasein's totality.  Consequently, it can be concluded that Heidegger views objects like hammers and boats as assuming different functions within a fluid system.
 (Choice A) having a mode of Being that is not immediately apparent.  Paragraph 4 conveys Heidegger's perspective: ""a hammer is typically not an object we stop and analyze but a tool we pick up and use....  Therefore, the hammer's common mode of Being is usefulness…it is 'ready-to-hand' rather than merely 'present-at-hand.'""  Similarly, a boat is ""only secondarily an object for observation and interpretation"" and ""primarily…a piece of equipment within a nexus of related such items…within many possible domains…utilized…by diverse individuals.""  Accordingly, objects like hammers and boats are items of equipment with ""a common mode of Being"" that is immediately apparent as useful or ""ready-to-hand.""
(Choice C) items laden with meaning apart from their contexts.  For Heidegger, Dasein means ""we are interconnected not only socially but 'equipmentally.'""  Hence, ""[t]he world is filled with objects we can manipulate for a variety of purposes.""  As Heidegger sees it, ""a hammer is…a tool we pick up and use, experiencing it more as an extension of our hand than an ontologically distinct entity.""  Like the hammer, ""a boat…functions primarily as a piece of equipment within a nexus of related such items"" and ""operates within many possible domains"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, items like hammers and boats are always embedded within various contexts that largely determine their meaning.
(Choice D) symbolizing the basic ingenuity of human beings.  Paragraph 4 describes both the hammer and the boat as primarily ""ready-to-hand' or having a ""common mode of Being that is usefulness.""  However, Heidegger never discusses these objects as symbolizing human ingenuity (creative resourcefulness); instead, he sees them as serving different functions within the ever-shifting networks of Dasein's totality."
"75","Which of the following best represents the main theme of the passage?","D","14","When twentieth-century German thinker Martin Heidegger contemplated the history of philosophy in the West, he noticed something astonishing: it seemed to have forgotten about the most fundamental of all philosophical questions, the question of Being. (Paragraph 1)
In this tortured and intimidating tome, Heidegger…dared to target the lofty towers of traditional Western metaphysical thought….  Above all, he believed that the revered triumvirate of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle had diverted the course of philosophy by turning away from ontology, or the study of Being, toward a metaphysics that merely pondered the nature of individual entities.  Furthermore, Heidegger thought that Descartes, as the first modern philosopher, had exacerbated this misguided focus….  [Heidegger] also began his quest for the meaning of Being with ordinary, everyday experience, with what it means to dwell within the world as a human being. (Paragraph 2)
Accordingly, Heidegger sought to gain an understanding of Being by analyzing the inherent structures of our basic ontological condition, the reality of our distinctively human existence or mode of Being, which he referred to as Dasein—a term roughly translated as ""being there."" (Paragraph 3)
Thus, in trying to ""call us back to the remembrance of Being,"" so long consigned to oblivion, and to overturn Western philosophy, Heidegger pitched ordinary experience into the ontological register, grounding metaphysics in everyday reality. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 1, Heidegger remarked that ""the history of philosophy in the West…seemed to have forgotten…the question of Being.""  As Paragraph 2 explains, Heidegger ""believed that the revered triumvirate…had diverted the course of philosophy…toward a metaphysics that merely pondered the nature of individual entities.""  Furthermore, ""Descartes…had exacerbated (made worse) this misguided focus.""  Consequently, Heidegger ""began his quest for the meaning of Being with ordinary, everyday experience.""
Paragraph 3 then outlines Heidegger's quest ""to gain an understanding of Being by analyzing…the reality of our distinctively human existence or mode of Being.""  Finally, Paragraph 5 conveys that ""in trying to 'call us back to the remembrance of Being'…and to overturn Western metaphysics, Heidegger pitched ordinary experience into the ontological register, grounding metaphysics in the everyday world.""
This evidence shows that the passage focuses on Heidegger's quest to restore the more basic question of Being to Western metaphysics.  Therefore, the statement that Heidegger strove to address the issue of Being through reincorporating more fundamental aspects of metaphysical study represents the main theme of the passage.
 By contrast, each of the following statements represents only a supporting passage idea:
In Heidegger's view, a dualistic approach to ontology cannot grasp the inherent structures of Being (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 2, ""the Cartesian paradigm (model) effectively severed self from world and subject from object.""  To counter this orientation, ""Heidegger adopted a nondualistic, phenomenological approach wherein perceiver and perceived are interdependent.""  Heidegger would then have used this approach to conduct his study of Being through an analysis of Dasein's inherent structures.  Accordingly, Heidegger's stated view of Descartes' approach serves only to highlight his own nondualistic approach in trying to analyze Dasein and reincorporate ontology into metaphysics.
Heidegger thought his predecessors had neglected the most essential philosophical question (Choice B).  Heidegger believed that his predecessors (the revered triumvirate and Descartes) ""seemed to have forgotten…the question of Being"" (Paragraph 1) and ""had diverted the course of philosophy by turning away from ontology"" (Paragraph 2).  However, this perceived neglect merely provides the context for Heidegger's quest to reincorporate Being.
According to Heidegger, we play a role along with other entities in co-creating the totality of Dasein (Choice C).  Paragraph 3 describes Heidegger's view: ""this existential condition of 'being-in-the-world' implies…we are…deeply invested in its intricate web of people and things.""  As Paragraph 3 specifies, ""[i]n the day-to-day business of living, we play shifting roles within countless contexts and subcontexts that form an interactive, seamlessly integrated totality of which we are the co-creators.""  Consequently, this statement pertains only to the concept of Dasein, which Heidegger analyzes in his quest to reincorporate Being."
"76","Which of the following actions by a candidate in an election best exemplifies an ""unwavering purity of principle"" as it is described in Paragraph 5?","B","15","A virtuous speaker thus faces a choice: (1) to present his case logically and without appeal to emotions or chicanery, trusting that the truth will prevail; or (2) to use every means at his disposal, noble or base, to achieve victory.  If Aristotle had observed enough instances of legal injustice, he may well have concluded that unwavering purity of principle simply risks too much. (Paragraph 5)
On this line of thought, Aristotle came to believe that ensuring the right outcomes justified whatever techniques were needed to secure them. (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 5 describes a choice that must be made by any ""virtuous speaker"" while arguing in court.  Such a speaker must choose whether: ""(1) to present his case logically and without appeal to emotions or chicanery (trickery or underhandedness)…or (2) to use every means at his disposal, noble or base, to achieve victory.""  Accordingly, a speaker who cares about justice has to decide whether to depend solely on legitimate reasoning or to engage in dirty tricks and deception to increase the chance of winning.
The author argues that ""[i]f Aristotle had observed enough instances of legal injustice, he may well have concluded that unwavering purity of principle simply risks too much"" (Paragraph 5).  In other words, Aristotle may have decided that while choice 1 might be more noble, that wasn't as important as whether the courts actually reached a just verdict.  Thus, the author suggests that ""Aristotle came to believe that ensuring the right outcomes justified whatever techniques were needed to secure them"" (Paragraph 6).  Accordingly, ""unwavering purity of principle"" (Paragraph 5) would mean refusing to resort to underhanded tactics.
Similarly, a political candidate must choose whether to run her campaign based only on honest reasoning and relevant issues, or to use tricks and deception to increase her chances of winning.  Consequently, an ""unwavering purity of principle"" would be best displayed by a candidate who discovers embarrassing personal information about her opponent's spouse but does not release it to the public.  Releasing such information might cause a negative perception of the opponent, but it would do so by attacking his or her loved one rather than addressing the opponent's experience, positions, or record.
  By contrast, none of the following decisions represents a refusal to use underhanded tactics:
The candidate refuses to deviate from her planned campaign strategy, even when her approval rating fluctuates (Choice A).  Although such a candidate would display unwavering commitment to a strategy, the scenario does not specify whether that strategy is based on honest reasoning or involves trickery.
The candidate continues to stress the platform on which she initially decided to run, even when polling shows that voters are more concerned with other issues (Choice C).  While this candidate would show commitment to her original platform, there is nothing to indicate that she refuses underhandedness by sticking to it.
The candidate compares records only for times in which she and her opponent both served in government, not stressing her own additional years of service (Choice D).  Although such a decision could be seen as a way of leveling the playing field, stressing the candidate's additional years of service would represent honest discussion about relevant facts, not deception or trickery."
"77","The author dismisses the idea that Aristotle was merely acknowledging emotional appeals as a common practice in the Rhetoric, because:
Aristotle seems to advocate other tactics of a similar nature
Aristotle would have been more thorough in addressing his topics
Aristotle's other works never enumerate practices without evaluating them","A","15","At the beginning of Book 1, the philosopher admonishes his students toward conscientious public speaking, denouncing the sophistical practices of arguing for false or unjust positions and making emotional appeals to the judges in court.  Rather, he instructs, one must argue only for what is true and good, and do so by appealing to proper reasoning and facts.  In light of Aristotle's other works, none of this is surprising.  What is puzzling, however, is that as soon as the second chapter he seems to suggest the opposite. (Paragraph 1)
For example, one of the modes of persuasion discussed there entails putting the audience into ""a certain frame of mind"" which ""stirs their emotions.""  One might suppose that Aristotle is not advocating this technique but merely acknowledging it as a common practice.  However, that explanation is undercut by the subsequent recommendation about written and unwritten law: ""If the written law tells against our case, clearly we must appeal to the universal law, and insist on its greater equity and justice….  If however the written law supports our case, we must urge that…not to use the laws is as bad as to have no laws at all."" (Paragraph 2)
In Paragraph 1, the author describes how Aristotle's Rhetoric appears to give conflicting instructions about how persuasive speaking should be conducted.  First, ""the philosopher admonishes his students toward conscientious public speaking, denouncing the sophistical practices of arguing for false or unjust positions and making emotional appeals to the judges in court.""  The author then remarks: ""What is puzzling, however, is that as soon as the second chapter he seems to suggest the opposite.""  Therefore, although Aristotle begins by denouncing the practices of making emotional appeals and arguing for false or unjust positions, he then appears to advocate both strategies.
Paragraph 2 considers the possibility that Aristotle does not actually endorse the technique of ""putting the audience into 'a certain frame of mind' which 'stirs their emotions,'"" but instead is ""merely acknowledging it as a common practice.""  However, the author rejects this idea because ""that explanation is undercut by the subsequent recommendation about written and unwritten law.""  Specifically, Aristotle writes that ""'If the written law tells against our case, clearly we must appeal to the universal law, and insist on its greater equity and justice….  If however the written law supports our case, we must urge that…not to use the laws is as bad as to have no laws at all.'""
This instruction implies that one would not care about which position on the law is more just, only about which helps one win.  Accordingly, Aristotle implicitly recommends ""arguing for false or unjust positions"" (Paragraph 1), which he had previously opposed.  Therefore, the author's reason for dismissing the idea that Aristotle was merely acknowledging emotional appeals as a common practice in the Rhetoric is that Aristotle seems to advocate other tactics of a similar nature (Number I).
  (Number II)  Aristotle would have been more thorough in addressing his topics.  Paragraph 1 conveys that Aristotle ""admonishes his students toward conscientious public speaking.""  Paragraph 2 then considers the suggestion that Aristotle was ""not advocating this technique [of making emotional appeals] but merely acknowledging it as a common practice.""  However, the author never suggests that Aristotle would have displayed a lack of thoroughness by acknowledging a common practice in this way.
(Number III)  Aristotle's other works never enumerate practices without evaluating them.  Paragraph 3 discusses ""the Aristotelian corpus,"" noting that ""the Metaphysics bases all reasoning on the law of non-contradiction, and the Nicomachean Ethics associates injustice with taking more than one's deserved share.  Both are a far cry from the Rhetoric's call to affirm or dispute the legality of contracts depending on 'whichever way suits us.'""  However, the author never mentions whether Aristotle's works ever enumerate practices without evaluating them."
"78","Which of the following best describes the central concern of the passage?","C","15","On first reading, there appears to be significant tension between what Aristotle initially claims in the Rhetoric and what he later proceeds to argue.  At the beginning of Book 1, the philosopher admonishes his students toward conscientious public speaking, denouncing the sophistical practices….  What is puzzling, however, is that as soon as the second chapter he seems to suggest the opposite. (Paragraph 1)
For example, one of the modes of persuasion discussed there entails putting the audience into ""a certain frame of mind"" which ""stirs their emotions.""  One might suppose that Aristotle is not advocating this technique but merely acknowledging it as a common practice.  However, that explanation is undercut by the subsequent recommendation about written and unwritten law. (Paragraph 2)
Another suggestion might be that Aristotle's view evolved, and that extant copies of the Rhetoric's first chapter are from an earlier version of the work.  However, this position would conflict with most of the Aristotelian corpus. (Paragraph 3)
A more fruitful resolution to this conundrum lies in drawing an important distinction.  While the Rhetoric does contain two conflicting implications about public speaking, the change in Aristotle's position may affect the method rather than the goal of rhetoric. (Paragraph 4)
This interpretation alleviates the tension within the Rhetoric by making the aim of achieving justice a precondition of those modes of argumentation. (Paragraph 6)
The passage is structured in a way that first presents a puzzle about one of Aristotle's works, then explores possible solutions to resolve it.  Paragraph 1 states that ""there appears to be significant tension between what Aristotle initially claims in the Rhetoric and what he later proceeds to argue.""  The author points out that ""[a]t the beginning of Book 1, the philosopher admonishes his students toward conscientious public speaking, denouncing…sophistical practices.""  Accordingly, it is ""puzzling"" that ""as soon as the second chapter he seems to suggest the opposite.""
The rest of the passage considers possible explanations for this tension.  For example, Paragraph 2 suggests that perhaps ""Aristotle is not advocating this [sophistical] technique but merely acknowledging it as a common practice.""  However, the author dismisses that idea because it ""is undercut by the subsequent recommendation about written and unwritten law.""  Similarly, Paragraph 3 mentions ""[a]nother suggestion…that Aristotle's view evolved,"" but notes that ""this position would conflict with most of the Aristotelian corpus.""
Paragraph 4 introduces the ""more fruitful resolution"" that ""[w]hile the Rhetoric does contain two conflicting implications about public speaking, the change in Aristotle's position may affect the method rather than the goal of rhetoric.""  Paragraph 6 endorses this view, concluding that ""[t]his interpretation alleviates the tension within the Rhetoric.""  Therefore, the central concern of the passage is best described as resolutions to a discrepancy between certain sections in Aristotle's Rhetoric.
  (Choice A)  problems inherent to the role of judges as described in Aristotle's Rhetoric.  The author argues that ""[w]hile the Rhetoric does contain two conflicting implications about public speaking, the change in Aristotle's position may affect the method rather than the goal of rhetoric"" (Paragraph 4).  He or she then states: ""One point in favor of this interpretation is Aristotle's view of judges as a necessary but regrettable feature of the courts.""  Therefore, this view of judges is supporting evidence for the author's overall position.
(Choice B)  the relative importance of written versus unwritten law as advocated in Aristotle's Rhetoric.  The author considers the possibility that ""Aristotle is not advocating this [sophistical] technique but merely acknowledging it as a common practice.""  However, ""that explanation is undercut by the subsequent recommendation about written and unwritten law"" (Paragraph 2).  Accordingly, the author cites this possibility as a supporting idea in the broader passage discussion.
(Choice D)  effects of Athenian injustice on the instruction offered in Aristotle's Rhetoric.  Paragraph 5 suggests: ""If Aristotle had observed enough instances of legal injustice, he may well have concluded that unwavering purity of principle simply risks too much.""  Although this is an important point in the author's argument, the passage as a whole also concerns other potential resolutions to the discrepancy in the Rhetoric.  Therefore, the effects of Athenian injustice on the instruction offered in Aristotle's Rhetoric forms only one part of the passage's central concern."
"79","According to the author, the Rhetoric makes divergent claims about oratory because Aristotle came to believe achieving justice outweighed his principles about methods.  Based on passage information, which of the following statements represents a competing hypothesis that might account for the differing claims instead?","C","15","Another suggestion might be that Aristotle's view evolved, and that extant copies of the Rhetoric's first chapter are from an earlier version of the work.  However, this position would conflict with most of the Aristotelian corpus.  Notably, the Metaphysics bases all reasoning on the law of non-contradiction, and the Nicomachean Ethics associates injustice with taking more than one's deserved share.  Both are a far cry from the Rhetoric's call to affirm or dispute the legality of contracts depending on ""whichever way suits us.""  This apparent shift toward sophism thus seems strangely anomalous. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 considers the possibility that ""Aristotle's view evolved, and that extant copies of the Rhetoric's first chapter are from an earlier version of the work.""  The author dismisses that idea because ""this position would conflict with most of the Aristotelian corpus.""  Hence, he or she notes that Book 1 of the Rhetoric reflects Aristotle's typical view while the later ""apparent shift toward sophism thus seems strangely anomalous (ie, a deviation from general tendencies).""  Accordingly, the passage implies it is unlikely that Aristotle's position had shifted toward sophism.
However, a shift in the opposite direction would be consistent with what the passage says about Aristotle's works.  If the position expressed in ""most of the Aristotelian corpus"" is considered his mature view, then Book 1 of the Rhetoric would reflect any evolution that had taken place in Aristotle's thinking.  Therefore, based on passage information, a competing hypothesis that might account for the differing claims in the Rhetoric instead would be that extant copies of the Rhetoric's first chapter are the beginning of a revision reflecting Aristotle's mature view.
  (Choice A)  Aristotle was not especially concerned with consistency in his writings.  Paragraph 1 describes what Book 1 of the Rhetoric states about public speaking, and notes that ""[i]n light of Aristotle's other works, none of this is surprising.""  Paragraph 3 likewise implies that these views are consistent with ""most of the Aristotelian corpus.""  Accordingly, the passage suggests that Aristotle generally did exhibit consistency in his writings.
(Choice B)  Aristotle saw it as more important to follow the universal law than the written law.  According to Paragraph 2, the Rhetoric states: ""'If the written law tells against our case, clearly we must appeal to the universal law….  If however the written law supports our case, we must urge that…not to use the laws is as bad as to have no laws at all.'""  Hence, Aristotle advocates arguing for either type of law depending on circumstance.  Therefore, passage information implies that Aristotle did not see it as more important to follow the universal law than the written law.
(Choice D)  Aristotle had concluded that it was necessary to use dishonest orators' own tactics against them.  Paragraph 4 discusses Aristotle's concern about ""dishonest orators, who may use emotional appeals and deceptive reasoning to confuse the judges into inadvertently rendering an unjust decision.""  The author suggests that Aristotle decided ""disreputable oratorical methods would then be permissible in service of a righteous cause, especially if one must counter similar tactics from an opponent.""  Hence, the author's argument includes the idea that Aristotle thought it was necessary to use dishonest orators' own tactics against them; thus, that would not represent a competing hypothesis."
"80","Based on Paragraphs 5 and 6, a modern lawyer would be most like Aristotle's ""virtuous speaker"" if she:","A","15","A virtuous speaker thus faces a choice: (1) to present his case logically and without appeal to emotions or chicanery, trusting that the truth will prevail; or (2) to use every means at his disposal, noble or base, to achieve victory.  If Aristotle had observed enough instances of legal injustice, he may well have concluded that unwavering purity of principle simply risks too much.  Perhaps he even had Socrates in mind, who famously upheld (1) at his own trial yet was convicted and executed through corruption in the Athenian courts. (Paragraph 5)
His instruction would therefore presuppose that a virtuous speaker always argues for the correct side.  Otherwise disreputable oratorical methods would then be permissible in service of a righteous cause, especially if one must counter similar tactics from an opponent.  This interpretation alleviates the tension within the Rhetoric by making the aim of achieving justice a precondition of those modes of argumentation. (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 5, ""[a] virtuous speaker thus faces a choice: (1) to present his case logically and without appeal to emotions or chicanery, trusting that the truth will prevail; or (2) to use every means at his disposal, noble or base, to achieve victory.""  The author suggests that Aristotle eventually advocated option 2, because he decided that achieving justice was more important than refusing to engage in trickery: ""[i]f Aristotle had observed enough instances of legal injustice, he may well have concluded that unwavering purity of principle simply risks too much.""  On this view, using deceptive reasoning would be justified if it helped to ensure a just outcome.
Paragraph 6 elaborates on this point, stating that Aristotle's instruction ""would therefore presuppose that a virtuous speaker always argues for the correct side.""  Given that assumption, ""[o]therwise disreputable oratorical methods would then be permissible in service of a righteous cause...making the aim of achieving justice a precondition of those modes of argumentation.""  Based on this description, Aristotle's idea of a virtuous speaker is someone who is entirely committed to ensuring that justice is done.
Consequently, a modern lawyer would be most like Aristotle's virtuous speaker if she accepts only clients whose cases she believes to be just.  By limiting her clients to those she believes are in the right, the lawyer would commit herself to the aim of achieving justice and always arguing for the correct side.
  (Choice B)  refuses to use emotional appeals in her arguments.  Paragraph 5 states that ""[a] virtuous speaker thus faces a choice"" of whether to argue ""logically and without appeal to emotions"" or to ""use every means at his disposal, noble or base, to achieve victory.""  Paragraph 6 then suggests that ""Aristotle came to believe that ensuring the right outcomes justified whatever techniques were needed to secure them,"" indicating that even a virtuous speaker would engage in emotional appeals if necessary.  Therefore, refusing to use emotional appeals would not most exemplify Aristotle's idea of a virtuous speaker as described in Paragraphs 5 and 6.
(Choices C and D)  promises not to charge clients if they lose the case; and uses whatever tactics are necessary to win.  According to Paragraph 6, ""Aristotle came to believe that ensuring the right outcomes justified whatever techniques were needed to secure them.  His instruction would therefore presuppose that a virtuous speaker always argues for the correct side.""  In each of these scenarios, the modern lawyer is described as committed to winning on behalf of her clients.  However, there is nothing which specifies that this lawyer only represents clients ""in service of a righteous cause"" or that she shares the virtuous speaker's ""aim of achieving justice"" in all her cases."
"81","Assume research reveals that human beings have a tendency to make specific types of logical errors.  How would this information affect the author's argument about the conflicting instructions in Aristotle's Rhetoric?","A","15","One point in favor of this interpretation is Aristotle's view of judges as a necessary but regrettable feature of the courts.  Because laws cannot cover every conceivable situation or contingency, judges are needed to decide whether a man has acted lawfully in a particular circumstance.  Unfortunately, this makes the justice system subject to potential bias or corruption, or simply the errors of fallible judgment.  The latter concern is considerably heightened due to dishonest orators, who may use emotional appeals and deceptive reasoning to confuse the judges into inadvertently rendering an unjust decision. (Paragraph 4)
On this line of thought, Aristotle came to believe that ensuring the right outcomes justified whatever techniques were needed to secure them.  His instruction would therefore presuppose that a virtuous speaker always argues for the correct side.  Otherwise disreputable oratorical methods would then be permissible in service of a righteous cause, especially if one must counter similar tactics from an opponent. (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 4, Aristotle viewed judges as ""a necessary but regrettable feature of the courts"" because they could potentially be tricked into promoting injustice.  Thus, although judges' roles were crucial, the dependence on them ""makes the justice system subject to potential bias or corruption, or simply the errors of fallible judgment.""  This concern about fallible (imperfect) judgment is ""heightened due to dishonest orators, who may use emotional appeals and deceptive reasoning to confuse the judges into inadvertently rendering an unjust decision.""
Paragraph 6 argues that as a result of this possibility, ""Aristotle came to believe that ensuring the right outcomes justified whatever techniques were needed to secure them.""  In particular, ""[o]therwise disreputable oratorical methods would then be permissible in service of a righteous cause, especially if one must counter similar tactics from an opponent.""  Therefore, the author attributes some of Aristotle's claims in the Rhetoric to the idea that judges were susceptible to making mistakes in their reasoning.
If research revealed that human beings have a tendency to make specific types of logical errors, this finding would apply to the Athenian judges as well, supporting the idea that they could be tricked into making unjust decisions.  Consequently, the research would support the idea that Athenian judges were vulnerable to being deceived.
  (Choice B)  the research would challenge the idea that Aristotle's view changed in regard to method rather than goal.  The author states that ""the change in Aristotle's position may affect the method rather than the goal of rhetoric.  One point in favor of this interpretation is Aristotle's view of judges as…subject to potential bias or corruption, or simply the errors of fallible judgment"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, research revealing that human beings have a tendency to make logical errors would not challenge the author's argument; it would be consistent with his or her suggestion about Aristotle's motivations.
(Choices C and D)  the research would support the idea that orators mistakenly argued for false or unjust positions; and the research would challenge the idea that dishonest orators were responsible for causing injustice.  Paragraph 4 refers to ""dishonest orators, who may use emotional appeals and deceptive reasoning to confuse the judges into inadvertently rendering an unjust decision.""  Accordingly, the author does not suggest that orators mistakenly argued for false or unjust positions, but that they did so intentionally in order to deceive the judges.  Furthermore, a natural tendency for humans to make specific types of logical errors would facilitate the orators' ability to confuse and deceive the judges.  Therefore, research that revealed such a tendency would not challenge the idea that dishonest orators were responsible for causing injustice."
"82","According to the passage, Poe believed that a machine could never play chess due to:","C","16","At one time, the prospect of machines playing chess was widely deemed absurd.  Writer Edgar Allan Poe declared in 1836 that its impossibility could be established a priori because, unlike the steps of a mathematical demonstration, ""[n]o one move in chess necessarily follows upon any one other.""  In the early 19th century, a human-shaped, turban-wearing machine called ""The Turk"" toured the United States as a supposed chess-playing automaton.  Although its owner claimed and seemed to prove that it was purely mechanical, Poe correctly concluded that the device was actually operated by a real person hidden inside its cabinet.  Despite this subterfuge, however, machine chess was not fundamentally impossible as Poe believed. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, Poe believed that the ""impossibility"" of a machine playing chess ""could be established a priori (purely through reason) because, unlike the steps of a mathematical demonstration, '[n]o one move in chess necessarily follows upon any one other.'""  This indicates Poe's belief that machines are capable of performing only tasks that proceed in a determinate, step-by-step fashion, like those in a mathematical demonstration.
Because playing chess is not an example of such a task, Poe believed that it was ""fundamentally impossible"" for a machine to play chess (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, according to the passage, Poe believed that a machine could never play chess because of a personal belief that machines are limited to certain types of functions.
  (Choice A)  the example of ""The Turk"" that had proved to be a fraud.  According to Paragraph 4, ""Poe correctly concluded that [The Turk] was actually operated by a real person hidden inside its cabinet.""  However, Poe's belief that The Turk could not play chess was based on his more general belief that it was ""fundamentally impossible"" for any machine to play chess.  In other words, his belief that machines cannot play chess was not based on discovering that the Turk was a fraud.  Rather, the reverse is true; he concluded that the Turk must be a fraud because of his belief that it was impossible for a machine to play chess.
(Choice B)  a mathematical proof that seemed to show machine chess to be impossible.  Poe argued that a game of chess was ""unlike the steps of a mathematical demonstration"" because ""[n]o one move in chess necessarily follows upon any one other"" (Paragraph 4).  However, the passage never states that Poe was influenced by a mathematical proof that seemed to show machine chess to be impossible.
(Choice D)  a prevailing opinion that the idea of machine chess was absurd.  Paragraph 4 states that ""[a]t one time, the prospect of machines playing chess was widely deemed absurd.""  Although the passage mentions Poe as an example of someone who shared that opinion, it describes him as arriving at that belief through a process of reasoning, not because it was widely held.  Specifically, Poe argued that no machine could play chess because they were limited to processes with fixed steps, whereas ""[n]o one move in chess necessarily follows upon any one other."""
"83","For which of the following items of passage information does the author provide the LEAST explanation or evidence?","C","16","The early chess computers of the 1960s possessed only limited abilities, but by 1997 IBM's ""Deep Blue"" had defeated world champion Garry Kasparov.  Today, the strongest chess computers are unbeatable in fair contests by even the most skilled human grandmasters. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 mentions Deep Blue, the IBM chess computer that ""defeated world champion Garry Kasparov"" in 1997.  However, the passage never discusses the reason for the computer's name.  Therefore, the author provides no explanation or evidence for the reason behind the name ""Deep Blue.""
  (Choice A)  What it means to win ""by flag.""  Paragraph 2 states that in addition to checkmate or the opponent's resignation, ""[o]ne may also win 'by flag' if the opponent runs out of time.""  Therefore, although the specific reference to a flag is not explained, the author makes clear that winning ""by flag"" means that the opponent has run out of time.
(Choice B)  What it means for a game to end ""by stalemate.""  According to Paragraph 2, ""not all games of chess result in a win for either side.  A draw may ensue by agreement of the players, by stalemate, or under certain other conditions.""  Therefore, the author indicates that ""by stalemate"" refers to one of the ways in which a game of chess may end in a draw (tie).
(Choice D)  The reason behind the name ""The Turk.""  Paragraph 4 states that ""[i]n the early 19th century, a human-shaped, turban-wearing machine called 'The Turk' toured the United States as a supposed chess-playing automaton.""  By describing the supposed automaton's appearance as ""human-shaped"" and mentioning a part of its clothing, the author conveys that it was meant to look like a mechanical human being.  Hence, the passage suggests that the machine was depicted as a person from Turkey (ie, a Turk) as part of its human-like persona."
"84","Based on passage information, one should expect:
experienced chess players to be unsurprised by a loss.
novice chess players to rarely achieve checkmate.
human chess players to lose to a strong computer.","B","16","Similarly, a common scenario in fiction is for a player to defeat an opponent by sudden surprise…In real chess such abrupt triumph occurs rarely or never, as the inevitability of checkmate will have been readily apparent to both sides. (Paragraph 1)
Indeed, at higher levels of play checkmate is uncommon, because the losing side typically resigns rather than prolong an unavoidable defeat by playing until checkmate has occurred. (Paragraph 2)
The early chess computers of the 1960s possessed only limited abilities, but by 1997 IBM's ""Deep Blue"" had defeated world champion Garry Kasparov.  Today, the strongest chess computers are unbeatable in fair contests by even the most skilled human grandmasters. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 1 indicates that in chess games between experienced players, an ""abrupt triumph occurs rarely or never, as the inevitability of checkmate will have been readily apparent to both sides.""  Therefore, based on passage information, one should expect experienced chess players to be unsurprised by a loss (Number I) as the impending loss would already be obvious.
Paragraph 4 discusses the strength of chess computers compared to humans, and notes that ""the strongest chess computers are unbeatable in fair contests by even the most skilled human grandmasters.""  Therefore, based on passage information, one should expect human chess players to lose to a strong computer (Number III).
  (Number II)  novice chess players to rarely achieve checkmate.  Paragraph 2 states that ""at higher levels of play checkmate is uncommon.""  However, the passage never suggests that checkmate is uncommon among novice players (ie, at lower levels of play).  Accordingly, the passage does not suggest that one should expect novice chess players to rarely achieve checkmate."
"85","Based on the passage, which of the following most accurately represents the author's view regarding the Frank Marshall chess game of 1912?","D","16","Public discourse about chess can occasionally veer into the ridiculous.  In 1912, it was reported that a move made by chess champion Frank Marshall elicited such admiration from onlookers that they showered gold pieces onto the board.  While the move may indeed be considered a brilliancy (thought by some to be the most beautiful chess move ever played), the story must otherwise be spurious.  Even supposing that the viewers were so impressed as to engage in such specific and effusive praise, precisely how much gold were they supposed to have had? (Paragraph 3)
The author states that Marshall's move in 1912 ""may indeed be considered a brilliancy"" and elaborates that it is ""thought by some to be the most beautiful chess move ever played"" (Paragraph 3).  He or she further states that it was such an amazing move that, supposedly, onlookers ""showered gold pieces onto the board"" in response.
The author then asks rhetorically: ""Even supposing that the viewers were so impressed as to engage in such specific and effusive praise, precisely how much gold were they supposed to have had?"" (Paragraph 3).  This remark expresses the author's skepticism that those spectators would have ""showered gold pieces onto the board,"" regardless of how brilliant or beautiful Marshall's move may have been.  Therefore, the author's view regarding the Frank Marshall chess game of 1912 is that the reports about the game were exaggerated.
  (Choices A and C)  Marshall's move was not as impressive as the story suggests; and The supposed game may not have really occurred.  Paragraph 3 states that Marshall's move ""may indeed be considered a brilliancy (thought by some to be the most beautiful chess move ever played),"" but asserts that ""the story must otherwise be spurious"" (ie, aside from Marshall's brilliancy, other claims regarding the story were likely false).  Therefore, although the author doubts some of the details of the story, he or she views Marshall's move as impressive and believes that the game in which it occurred did take place.
(Choice B)  ""Beauty"" in chess is highly subjective.  By calling Marshall's move ""a brilliancy,"" the author supports the view that Marshall's move should be considered beautiful.  However, the author never suggests that beauty in chess is highly subjective."
"86","The passage discussion about machines and chess implies that:","A","16","For instance, a non-player might wonder about the maximum number of moves that can be planned in advance, but an experienced player would find that question naïve.  The unsatisfying but accurate answer is that it depends on the position, because the opponent's potential moves will at some points require calculating numerous possibilities but at other points will be an entirely forced sequence. (Paragraph 1)
Today, the strongest chess computers are unbeatable in fair contests by even the most skilled human grandmasters. (Paragraph 4)
Nevertheless, however unassailable in the realm of calculation, computers will always lack the most valuable trait of any chess player. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 1, planning moves in advance can be difficult ""because the opponent's potential moves will at some points require calculating numerous possibilities.""  This indicates that human chess players are limited in their ability to calculate all the possible moves that could arise from a particular point in a game.
On the other hand, ""the strongest chess computers are unbeatable in fair contests by even the most skilled human grandmasters"" (Paragraph 4), as computers are ""unassailable in the realm of calculation"" (Paragraph 5), meaning that they are able to calculate a multitude of future moves.  Therefore, the passage discussion of machines and chess implies that a computer's advantage over humans lies in its greater ability to calculate possible moves.
  (Choice B)  The Turk was a forerunner of modern chess computers.  Although The Turk was claimed to be a mechanical ""chess-playing automaton,"" it was actually a fraud ""operated by a real person hidden inside its cabinet"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, The Turk was not a forerunner of modern chess computers, which are genuine chess-playing machines.
(Choice C)  Poe's reasoning about machine chess was flawed due to the technology of his time.  According to Paragraph 4, Poe declared in 1836 that the impossibility of machine chess ""could be established a priori (purely through reason) because, unlike the steps of a mathematical demonstration, '[n]o one move in chess necessarily follows upon any one other.'""  The author later mentions ""[t]he early chess computers of the 1960s,"" indicating that the first chess-playing machines were not invented until more than a century after Poe's claim.  Therefore, although Poe was wrong that machine chess is impossible, his reasoning was based on facts about mathematics and the nature of chess; the passage never suggests that Poe's reasoning was based on the technology of his time.
(Choice D)  when humans play chess against computers, the humans always lose.  Paragraph 4 states that ""the strongest chess computers are unbeatable in fair contests by even the most skilled human grandmasters.""  This statement implies that there are weaker chess computers that a human player may be able to defeat.  Hence, the passage does not necessarily suggest that when humans play chess against (any) computers, the humans always lose."
"87","Which of the following is an assumption in the passage?","B","16","Although most people have some idea of what chess entails, there are many misconceptions about its practice.  For instance, a non-player might wonder about the maximum number of moves that can be planned in advance, but an experienced player would find that question naïve.  The unsatisfying but accurate answer is that it depends on the position, because the opponent's potential moves will at some points require calculating numerous possibilities but at other points will be an entirely forced sequence.  Similarly, a common scenario in fiction is for a player to defeat an opponent by sudden surprise—the rival's look of confidence morphing into complete disbelief as the winner unexpectedly proclaims ""Checkmate.""  In real chess such abrupt triumph occurs rarely or never, as the inevitability of checkmate will have been readily apparent to both sides. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 discusses some of the ""many misconceptions"" that non-players imagine about chess, such as the ""unsatisfying but accurate answer"" regarding the ""number of moves that can be planned in advance,"" which ""depends on the position"" rather than solely on a player's mental skills.  Similarly, although a dramatic surprise checkmate granting sudden victory over a rival may be ""a common scenario in fiction,"" in actual chess it ""occurs rarely or never.""  Accordingly, the passage makes the assumption that some aspects of chess are less dramatic than people imagine.
  (Choice A)  The strongest computers make human chess obsolete.  Paragraph 4 states that ""the strongest chess computers are unbeatable in fair contests by even the most skilled human grandmasters.""  However, the passage goes on to state that ""computers will always lack the most valuable trait of any chess player"" because, unlike humans, ""they can never experience their victory"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, the passage suggests that human chess still has value that is absent in computer chess, and does not assume that the strongest computers make human chess obsolete.
(Choice C)  Even people who do not play chess usually know a lot about it.  Paragraph 1 states that ""[a]lthough most people have some idea of what chess entails, there are many misconceptions about its practice.""  The passage then goes on to describe some of the mistaken impressions that ""a non-player"" may have, such as the ""naïve"" idea that experts can plot a certain number of moves in advance regardless of the position.  Therefore, the passage assumes that people who do not play or are unfamiliar with chess often know only a little about it.
(Choice D)  It is relatively rare for a game of chess to end in a draw.  Paragraph 2 states that ""not all games of chess result in a win for either side.  A draw may ensue by agreement of the players, by stalemate, or under certain other conditions.""  However, the passage never discusses how frequently or infrequently draws occur.  Therefore, the passage does not include the assumption that it is relatively rare for a game of chess to end in a draw."
"88","Suppose that a chess expert intentionally continues playing until his opponent has achieved checkmate, instead of just resigning.  Based on passage information, the most reasonable explanation for this fact would be that:","A","16","Similarly, a common scenario in fiction is for a player to defeat an opponent by sudden surprise—the rival's look of confidence morphing into complete disbelief as the winner unexpectedly proclaims ""Checkmate.""  In real chess such abrupt triumph occurs rarely or never, as the inevitability of checkmate will have been readily apparent to both sides. (Paragraph 1)
Indeed, at higher levels of play checkmate is uncommon, because the losing side typically resigns rather than prolong an unavoidable defeat by playing until checkmate has occurred. (Paragraph 2)
…a move made by chess champion Frank Marshall…may indeed be considered a brilliancy (thought by some to be the most beautiful chess move ever played)… (Paragraph 3)
The artistry of a move like Marshall's will forever be lost on them, while a human being can view and partake in its beauty, making the enjoyment of chess a distinctly human pleasure. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 1 states that ""a common scenario in fiction is for a player to defeat an opponent by sudden surprise.""  However, ""[i]n real chess such abrupt triumph occurs rarely or never, as the inevitability of checkmate will have been readily apparent to both sides.""  Thus, the passage indicates that a chess expert who continued playing until his opponent achieved checkmate would know that his opponent was about to win the game.
Similarly, Paragraph 2 asserts that ""at higher levels of play checkmate is uncommon, because the losing side typically resigns rather than prolong an unavoidable defeat by playing until checkmate has occurred.""  Accordingly, the passage conveys that if a chess expert were going to be checkmated, he would be aware of that fact in advance, and would typically resign prior to checkmate actually happening.  Thus, if an expert did not resign in that situation, there must be a reason why he was motivated to keep playing until his opponent achieved checkmate.
One potential reason is suggested later in the passage, as certain moves in chess are described as beautiful and artistic.  For example, Paragraph 3 calls a particular move ""a brilliancy,"" and notes that it is ""thought by some to be the most beautiful chess move ever played.""  Likewise, Paragraph 5 describes the ""artistry"" of such a move, stating that ""a human being can view and partake in its beauty, making the enjoyment of chess a distinctly human pleasure.""
Therefore, a chess expert might intentionally continue to play until his opponent had achieved checkmate (rather than just resigning) if the sequence of moves leading to checkmate was so beautiful that the expert let it play out.
  (Choice B)  The opponent's choice of moves demonstrated that he was an even stronger player than the expert.  Although being a stronger player would make it more likely for the opponent to win, that would not mean that the expert would fail to recognize ""the inevitability of checkmate"" (Paragraph 1), or have a reason not to resign.
(Choice C)  Throughout the game, the moves made by the opponent were extremely unusual.  This scenario suggests that because the opponent's moves were unusual, the chess expert was caught off guard and did not realize that he was about to be checkmated.  However, the passage explicitly rules out this idea as one of ""many misconceptions"" about chess, stating that although it represents ""a common scenario in fiction,"" it ""occurs rarely or never"" in real chess (Paragraph 1).
(Choice D)  The expert believed that the opponent's attack was bound to eventually succeed.  Paragraph 2 states that ""at higher levels of play checkmate is uncommon, because the losing side typically resigns rather than prolong an unavoidable defeat by playing until checkmate has occurred.""  Accordingly, believing the opponent's attack would succeed is a reason for the expert to resign; it is not a reason for him to keep playing."
"89","The passage discussion of stage acting is unusual in that the author gives attention to:","B","17","Most scholarly attention, however, has traditionally been directed toward one-way theatrical practices by which performers engage, transform, and heighten the bodily state of the audience through a framework of communal 'felt-experience,' and not vice versa.  (Paragraph 1)
The actors on stage are ostensibly the central object of attention, yet their communication with those in attendance is not solely a one-way discourse.  (Paragraph 2)
The audience serves an integral function in the performance: it activates, intensifies, and amplifies the circulation of emotional affect in a communal social space.  Individually and collectively, each spectator is able to participate in the intrinsically variable theatrical plot….  In this way, the performer dutifully influences the audience, and the audience, in essence, ""re-affects"" the stage.  (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 1, ""most scholarly attention…has traditionally been directed toward one-way theatrical practices by which performers engage, transform, and heighten the bodily state of the audience...and not vice versa.""  In other words, theater historians have generally focused their ""scholarly attention"" on how the performer affects the audience.
However, the author diverges from this trend by highlighting the idea that an audience can also affect performers.  For example, Paragraph 2 states that the actors' ""communication with those in attendance is not solely a one-way discourse.""  Similarly, Paragraph 6 describes a two-way emotional exchange or ""mutual 'transmission of affect'"" between performers and audience: ""the performer dutifully influences the audience, and the audience, in essence, 're-affects' the stage.""  Therefore, the passage discussion of stage acting is unusual in that the author gives attention to the impact of the audience on performers.
 (Choices A and C)  the effect of performers on audiences; and the transformative nature of theater for audiences.  According to Paragraph 1, ""Most scholarly attention…has traditionally been directed toward one-way theatrical practices by which performers engage, transform, and heighten the bodily state of the audience.""  Therefore, the passage implies that it is typical to discuss a transformative effect that theater performers have on audiences.
(Choice D)  the ability of some performers to capture an audience.  Paragraph 5 presents a general view of theater that ""[b]ecause the audience is the proclaimed foundation of a theatrical event, a staged play aims to affect the audience, usually by 'capturing' the viewers in some poignant manner.""  However, the passage never suggests that it is unusual for discussions of stage acting to give attention to this idea."
"90","Based on the passage, audience members must do which of the following to have an emotional connection with performers and impact them on stage?","C","17","Nevertheless, performers are ultimately the vessels responsible for detecting and absorbing the moods, attitudes, and emotions of individuals, and these aspects are vital to the apparent success or failure of the performative process.  (Paragraph 3)
According to this paradigm, there can be no performance without an audience.  Despite this, the presence of spectators does not guarantee that a meaningful emotional, or affective, exchange will transpire.  Such collective encounters in a shared space and time present only the possibility—for connection or disconnection; and, accordingly, an audience member must be physically present and willing to be affectively influenced.  (Paragraph 5)
The audience serves an integral function in the performance: it activates, intensifies, and amplifies the circulation of emotional affect in a communal social space…In this way, the performer dutifully influences the audience, and the audience, in essence, ""re-affects"" the stage.  (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 3, ""performers are…responsible for detecting and absorbing the moods, attitudes, and emotions of individuals, and these aspects are vital to the apparent success or failure of the performative process.""  However, the author argues that this process of emotional exchange requires the active participation of the audience.  For instance, Paragraph 5 conveys that the mere ""presence of spectators does not guarantee that a meaningful emotional, or affective, exchange will transpire….  [A]n audience member must be physically present and willing to be affectively influenced.""
Paragraph 6 further stresses the audience's role, which ""serves an integral function in the performance: it activates, intensifies, and amplifies the circulation of emotional affect in a communal social space.""  In other words, by engaging with the performance and reacting to it emotionally, the audience takes part in a mutual exchange: ""the performer dutifully influences the audience, and the audience, in essence, 're-affects' the stage.""  Implicitly, then, for audience members to have an emotional connection with performers and impact them on stage, they must be attentive and expressive during the performance.
 (Choice A)  Be willing to engage in theatrical experiments.  Paragraph 1 conveys that ""[c]ontextual Futurists, nonsensical Dadaists, and the surreal avant-garde theatrical experiments upended the conventional notion of passive spectatorship.""  Therefore, the author indicates that theatrical experiments represented one method by which audiences played a more active role in influencing performers on stage, but not that it was the only such method.  Moreover, the passage does not suggest that theatrical experiments were required for the process of performers ""detecting and absorbing the moods, attitudes, and emotions"" of the audience (Paragraph 3).
(Choice B)  Feel excited about the prospect of viewing the performance.  According to Paragraph 5, ""the presence of spectators does not guarantee that a meaningful emotional, or affective, exchange will transpire.""  Rather, in order for such an exchange to occur, ""an audience member must be physically present and willing to be affectively influenced.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that to have an emotional connection with performers and impact them on stage, an audience member must be willing to take part in such a connection during the performance.  However, the passage never indicates that such a connection requires audience members to feel excited in advance of viewing the performance (ie, excited about the prospect of viewing it).
(Choice D)  Actively participate in parts of the live performance.  In Paragraph 4, the author quotes an actor's description that ""for the audience to be 'with' the performer, it must embrace a state of tension and immerse itself in the profundity of the performance.""  Accordingly, the passage indicates that to have an emotional connection with performers and impact them on stage, an audience member must be willing to take part in a shared emotional experience.  However, the passage never suggests that this emotional connection requires audience members to actively participate in parts of the live performance itself."
"91","Which of the following scenarios would be the best example of a ""transmission of affect"" as it is described in the passage?","B","17","The audience serves an integral function in the performance: it activates, intensifies, and amplifies the circulation of emotional affect in a communal social space.  Individually and collectively, each spectator is able to participate in the intrinsically variable theatrical plot.  Affect is thereby experienced simultaneously through action, thought, and perception by both the artist and the audience.  This mutual ""transmission of affect"" induces a corporeal sentiment that ultimately resonates as a palpably emotional atmosphere...In this way, the performer dutifully influences the audience, and the audience, in essence, ""re-affects"" the stage.  (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 6, the ""transmission of affect"" is an experience in which performers and audiences impact each other in a mutual exchange of emotion: ""the performer…influences the audience, and the audience, in essence, 're-affects' the stage.""  In other words, the audience receives and reflects the emotion of the performers, which in turn emotionally influences the performers themselves.  The author describes this phenomenon more generally as a ""circulation of emotional affect in a communal social space.""  Therefore, the transmission of affect is like an emotional loop in which two parties influence, and are influenced by, each other.
Consequently, such an exchange would be best exemplified by cheering fans at a basketball game who encourage their team to score the winning points.  The fans collectively raise their voices to encourage their team; the team, influenced by the fans' cheering, is further motivated to score (which in turn encourages further cheering).  In this way, the fans and the team mutually amplify the emotional atmosphere, producing a transmission of affect.
 By contrast, each of the following scenarios describes an emotional influence on a single party, not a mutual exchange of emotion:
A child is given a hearing aid and feels joy upon hearing sound for the first time (Choice A).  Although the child has been impacted emotionally by the experience of hearing, no mention is made of the child's joy impacting another person.
The memory of a childhood coach motivates an Olympic diver before her toughest dive (Choice C).  In this situation, the diver is emotionally influenced by the memory of her coach.  However, the motivation she feels as a result of this memory does not in turn influence her coach or another party.
A surgeon promises a patient's spouse that a surgical procedure will be successful (Choice D).  The surgeon's promise might provide emotional relief to the spouse by reassuring him or her of a positive outcome to the surgery.  However, no suggestion is made that the spouse also emotionally influences the surgeon."
"92","The author's attitude toward the comments of the ""well-known stage actor"" (Paragraph 3) can be best described as:","C","17","Their predilection for tactile idiomatic expressions when describing the performer-audience connection is perfectly captured in these remarks from a well-known stage actor…  (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 states that when performers describe the experience of connecting with the audience, they have a ""predilection"" (preference or liking) to use ""tactile idiomatic expressions"" (ie, language relating to the perception of physical touch).  The author then asserts that this feature of the performer-audience connection is ""perfectly captured"" by the remarks of a well-known stage actor, implying that they constitute an extremely representative example of such tactile idiomatic expressions.  Therefore, the author has an assenting attitude toward those remarks.
 (Choice A)  affectionate.  The author indicates that he or she agrees with the actor's remarks by stating that they have ""perfectly captured"" performers' ""predilection for tactile idiomatic expressions"" (Paragraph 3).  However, agreement is not the same as displaying an attitude of affection (ie, fondness or tenderness).
(Choices B and D)  impartial; and adverse.  By stating that performers' ""predilection for tactile idiomatic expressions…is perfectly captured in these remarks from a well-known stage actor"" (Paragraph 3), the author implies that he or she agrees with those remarks.  Accordingly, the author's attitude toward those remarks would not be impartial or adverse."
"93","Suppose that the plays ""Shogun"" and ""The King and I"" are being performed at a Broadway theater in New York City.  Based on the passage, which of the following is least likely to be true?","C","17","Nevertheless, performers are ultimately the vessels responsible for detecting and absorbing the moods, attitudes, and emotions of individuals, and these aspects are vital to the apparent success or failure of the performative process.  One day, actors might find the audience energetic, welcoming, and appreciative; the next day, they may find a stiff, critical, and disconnected crowd, even when performing in the same production with unchanged levels of enthusiasm.  In some instances, a single audience may be unmoved, regardless of how well a show is performed.  (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, there may be significant variation in how different audiences react to a performance: ""One day, actors might find the audience energetic, welcoming, and appreciative; the next day, they may find a stiff, critical, and disconnected crowd, even when performing in the same production with unchanged enthusiasm.""  Therefore, the passage implies that performers cannot predict how a given audience will respond to a show, even in light of their experience with previous audiences.  Consequently, it would be least likely that performers can predict the audience response to the upcoming production of ""Shogun.""
 By contrast, the passage suggests that all of the following scenarios would be more likely:
Performers are able to clearly gauge the audience's reaction during ""Shogun"" (Choice A).  Paragraph 3 states that ""performers are ultimately the vessels responsible for detecting and absorbing the moods, attitudes, and emotions of individuals….  One day, actors might find the audience energetic, welcoming, and appreciative; the next day, they may find a stiff, critical, and disconnected crowd.""  Accordingly, the passage conveys that performers can and do gauge how an audience reacts to a performance.
Performers are capable of describing the audience's reaction to ""The King and I"" (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 2, ""it is common to hear professional performers commentate on audience reaction.""  For instance, ""sometimes the spectators were 'attuned'; at other times they seemed 'aloof.'  Occasionally, performers feel as if they 'captured' the audience; at other times, they perceive that they 'lost touch' with the viewers entirely.""  Therefore, the passage provides examples of how performers describe an audience's reaction to a show.
(Choice D)  The audience members hold the actors responsible for the success of ""The King and I.""  In Paragraph 3, the author states that ""performers are ultimately…responsible for detecting and absorbing the moods, attitudes, and emotions"" of the audience.  Furthermore, the performance skills of the actors are ""vital to the apparent success or failure of the performative process.""  Therefore, passage information suggests it is likely that audience members would hold the actors responsible for the success of a performance of ""The King and I"" (or any show)."
"94","Suppose that a new actor is scheduled to appear in the musical ""Oklahoma.""  Based on the passage, the author would most likely argue it is important for the actor to:","C","17","Nevertheless, performers are ultimately the vessels responsible for detecting and absorbing the moods, attitudes, and emotions of individuals, and these aspects are vital to the apparent success or failure of the performative process.  (Paragraph 3)
The audience serves an integral function in the performance: it activates, intensifies, and amplifies the circulation of emotional affect in a communal social space….  Entertainers can only know if the audience is 'present' to the degree that they also embrace the mutual tension of the experience.  In this way, the performer dutifully influences the audience, and the audience, in essence, ""re-affects"" the stage.  (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 3, ""performers are…responsible for detecting and absorbing the moods, attitudes, and emotions of individuals,"" factors that the author asserts are ""vital to the apparent success or failure of the performative process.""  Paragraph 6 further emphasizes the effect of an audience's emotional response, asserting that ""[t]he audience serves an integral function in the performance: it activates, intensifies, and amplifies the circulation of emotional affect in a communal social space.""
Thus, the passage conveys that the emotional interaction between audience and performer is a crucial aspect of theatrical success: ""the performer dutifully influences the audience, and the audience, in essence, 're-affects' the stage"" (Paragraph 6).  Consequently, the author would most likely argue that it is important for an actor to perceive the heightened feelings of the audience during a powerful scene.
 By contrast, the author would not most likely argue it is important for the actor to:
discuss audience engagement with fellow actors after the first performance (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 2, ""After the curtain falls at the end of a performance, it is common to hear professional performers commentate on audience reaction.""  However, the author would most likely view discussing audience engagement after a show as less important than perceiving audience engagement during a show, which is ""vital to the apparent success or failure of the performative process"" (Paragraph 3).
comprehend theater and the role of the audience from a historical perspective (Choice B).  The passage focuses largely on how performers and audiences influence each other through ""the circulation of emotional affect in a communal social space"" (Paragraph 6).  However, the author never suggests that an actor must comprehend theater and the role of the audience from a historical perspective in order to engage in that process.
become accustomed to a derisive audience after making a blunder on stage (Choice D).  Paragraph 2 states that ""[i]n some instances, a single audience may be unmoved, regardless of how well a show is performed.""  However, the author never discusses actors making blunders (mistakes) on stage or how an audience might react to such blunders."
"95","Based on information contained in the passage, which of the following would one LEAST expect to have observed in the theater throughout the twentieth century?","C","17","Throughout the twentieth century, the performer-spectator dynamic has been challenged both in artistic practice and from a theoretical perspective.  Contextual Futurists, nonsensical Dadaists, and the surreal avant-garde theatrical experiments upended the conventional notion of passive spectatorship, paving the way for performers to disrupt the invisible wall between artist and audience altogether.  (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 begins by describing innovations to the theater in which ""[t]hroughout the twentieth century, the performer-spectator dynamic has been challenged.""  In particular, performances included ""theatrical experiments"" that ""upended the conventional notion of passive spectatorship, paving the way for performers to disrupt the invisible wall between the artist and audience altogether.""  Accordingly, the passage indicates that performers and audiences had traditionally been viewed as completely separate, divided by an ""invisible wall"" that could not be crossed.
However, because this ""conventional notion"" was challenged in the twentieth century, one could no longer assume that the distance between performers and audiences was absolute or uncrossable.  Consequently, one would least expect to find impenetrable boundaries between the performers on stage and the spectators throughout the twentieth century.  Instead, the separation between the two groups would be blurred, suggesting that such boundaries might be ignored or eliminated during a performance.
 By contrast, any of the following would be more expected in twentieth century theater, as they represent a challenge to the separation of audience and performers:
Unique methods of incorporating audience members into the first act of a play (Choice A).  Incorporating audience members into the play would exemplify how ""the performer-spectator dynamic has been challenged…in artistic practice"" (Paragraph 1).
Audience members joining cast members on stage during the curtain call (Choice B).  By placing audience members literally on stage with the actors, this situation would ""disrupt the invisible wall between the artist and audience altogether"" (Paragraph 1).
Live theatrical experiments involving spectators and performers (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 1, ""surreal avant-garde theatrical experiments upended the conventional notion of passive spectatorship."""
"96","Which of the following supposed features of ancient Jericho best explains why Braidwood stated that the radiocarbon dates must be wrong?","B","18","Initial radiocarbon dating indicated that Jericho's original walls were built in around 6900 to 6800 B.C.  As Emmanuel Anati noted in a 1962 publication, that would not just make Jericho ""the only place in the world where a walled town has been found to date back to nine thousand years ago,"" but also make it ""four thousand years older than any similar settlement known at present.""  Moreover, the city would have been politically unique for its time and region, as constructing the fortifications—including a defensive ditch and tower in addition to the walls—must have required extensive coordination of labor by a strong, centralized leadership.  Other contemporaneous groups were generally much smaller and more loosely organized, often semi-nomadic confederations largely dependent on hunting. (Paragraph 2)
These and other considerations have divided the archaeological community, with scholars such as Robert Braidwood stating that the supposed radiocarbon dates are too early and must be wrong.  Others, like British School of Archaeology director Kathleen Kenyon, accept the accuracy of the dates but seek to explain why Jericho appears to represent such an anomaly. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 2, if the initial radiocarbon dates of ""around 6900 to 6800 B.C."" are correct, then many features of ancient Jericho would have been extremely unusual for its time.  For example, Jericho would be not just ""'the only place in the world where a walled town has been found to date back to nine thousand years ago,' but also…'four thousand years older than any similar settlement known at present.'""  In addition, Jericho ""would have been politically unique"" in possessing ""a strong, centralized leadership"" at a time when ""[o]ther contemporaneous groups were generally much smaller and more loosely organized.""
Paragraph 3 then asserts: ""These and other considerations have divided the archaeological community, with scholars such as Robert Braidwood stating that the supposed radiocarbon dates are too early and must be wrong.""  Therefore, Jericho's radical difference from other settlements (if the radiocarbon dates are correct) best explains why Braidwood stated that those dates must be wrong.
  (Choice A)  Jericho's mysterious abandonment.  Paragraph 3 states that ""[a]nother puzzle"" surrounding Jericho's sustenance is ""why Jericho, if it was particularly conducive to cultivating crops, seems to have been abandoned at certain points in its history while nearby settlements flourished.""  However, the passage does not connect the fact that Jericho ""seems to have been abandoned at certain points"" to Braidwood's objection to the initial radiocarbon dates.  Moreover, such a puzzle would require explanation regardless of when Jericho was built.
(Choice C)  Jericho's agricultural similarity to other settlements.  According to Paragraph 3, scholars such as Kathleen Kenyon ""accept the accuracy of the dates but seek to explain why Jericho appears to represent such an anomaly (departure from the norm).""  Part of Kenyon's proposed explanation for Jericho's uniqueness was that Jericho was sustained by ""successful agriculture.""  However, Braidwood ""disputes this conclusion, arguing that Jericho's land was no more suitable for agriculture than were neighboring areas.""  Therefore, the passage connects the initial radiocarbon dates to the idea that Jericho was agriculturally distinct from other settlements, not agriculturally similar.  In other words, agricultural similarity is part of Braidwood's view, not one of the ""supposed features"" of ancient Jericho that he argues against.
(Choice D)  Jericho's dependence on the Dead Sea.  Paragraph 4 describes Emmanuel Anati's view that ""the Dead Sea indeed played a critical role in Jericho's sustenance…by providing valuable economic resources.""  However, the passage does not suggest that Braidwood objects to the idea that Jericho depended on the Dead Sea.  Rather, he disputes the initial radiocarbon dates because of how historically unusual Jericho would be if those dates were accurate.  For instance, Jericho would be ""'four thousand years older than any similar settlement known at present'"" (Paragraph 2)."
"97","According to the passage, given the city's fortifications, which of the following features did Jericho probably possess that made it atypical among settlements of its time?","D","18","Moreover, the city would have been politically unique for its time and region, as constructing the fortifications—including a defensive ditch and tower in addition to the walls—must have required extensive coordination of labor by a strong, centralized leadership.  Other contemporaneous groups were generally much smaller and more loosely organized, often semi-nomadic confederations largely dependent on hunting. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 states that Jericho ""would have been politically unique for its time and region, as constructing the fortifications…must have required extensive coordination of labor by a strong, centralized leadership.""  The author then adds that ""[o]ther contemporaneous groups were generally much smaller and more loosely organized, often semi-nomadic confederations.""  Consequently, the passage indicates that, given Jericho's fortifications, it was most likely atypical among settlements of its time in possessing an unusually centralized government.
  (Choice A) An unusually trade-based economy.  According to Paragraph 4, Emmanuel Anati concluded that ""'Only trade comes seriously into consideration as a major means of accumulating the surplus necessary to maintain such a wealthy town in the seventh millennium B.C.'""  Therefore, a trade-based economy is suggested as an explanation for Jericho's wealth; however, it is not specifically mentioned as a requirement for constructing the city's fortifications.  In addition, the passage never discusses the extent to which other settlements engaged in trade.  By contrast, the presumed ""strong, centralized leadership"" of Jericho is treated as highly atypical compared to ""[o]ther contemporaneous groups,"" which ""were generally much smaller and more loosely organized"" (Paragraph 2).
(Choices B and C) An unusually plentiful food supply for its population; and An unusually fertile farmland.  Kathleen Kenyon has attributed Jericho's sustenance in part to ""'the spring by which the settlement is situated, assuring the productivity of the fields.'""  However, this idea is meant to explain how food could be provided for such ""a large, permanent city"" (Paragraph 3), a question that would arise even if the city were not surrounded by fortifications.  The fortifications themselves are instead presented as evidence of ""extensive coordination of labor by a strong, centralized leadership"" (Paragraph 2)."
"98","According to the author, scholars agree that hunting would have been insufficient to provide for Jericho's sustenance.  However, flint arrowheads have been discovered in the excavations of Jericho.  Does this information challenge the scholars' view as it is described in the passage?","C","18","One issue relates to Jericho's food supply, which must have been substantial to maintain a large, permanent city.  In 1954, Kenyon concluded that ""the basis of the settlement must be successful agriculture,"" further noting ""the spring by which the settlement is situated, assuring the productivity of the fields.""  But Braidwood disputes this conclusion, arguing that Jericho's land was no more suitable for agriculture than were neighboring areas.  Another puzzle is why Jericho, if it was particularly conducive to cultivating crops, seems to have been abandoned at certain points in its history while nearby settlements flourished.  All sides in the debate agree that hunting would have been insufficient to sustain a population of Jericho's size.  Fishing has been suggested as an alternative possibility, but this too is widely deemed unlikely to have provided adequate support for Jericho's growth. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, archaeologists have debated factors related to ""Jericho's food supply, which must have been substantial to maintain a large, permanent city.""  Some, like Kathleen Kenyon, proposed that Jericho was sustained primarily through ""'successful agriculture,'"" while others such as Robert Braidwood argued that ""Jericho's land was no more suitable for agriculture than were neighboring areas.""  Despite disagreeing about agriculture, however, ""[a]ll sides in the debate agree that hunting would have been insufficient to sustain a population of Jericho's size.""  Similarly, ""[f]ishing…is widely deemed unlikely to have provided adequate support for Jericho's growth.""
However, arguing that a particular method of food acquisition would have been inadequate is not the same as arguing that it was absent altogether.  For example, even if ""hunting would have been insufficient to sustain a population of Jericho's size"" (Paragraph 3), that does not mean that the people of Jericho did not obtain some portion of their food through hunting.  Therefore, the discovery of flint arrowheads at Jericho does not challenge the scholars' view, because the scholars suggest only that hunting would have been inadequate to sustain Jericho's population on its own.
  (Choices A and B)  Yes, because it is more consistent with the information that contemporaneous groups were largely dependent on hunting; and Yes, because it constitutes material evidence that the inhabitants of Jericho fashioned implements for hunting.  According to Paragraph 2, ""Other contemporaneous groups were generally much smaller and more loosely organized, often semi-nomadic confederations largely dependent on hunting.""  Therefore, the passage suggests that Jericho was atypical in comparison to contemporaneous groups that were largely hunting-based.  However, even if other settlements were more dependent on hunting than Jericho was, the population of Jericho may still have obtained some of its food through hunting.  Consequently, the discovery of flint arrowheads would not challenge scholars' view that ""hunting would have been insufficient to sustain a population of Jericho's size"" (Paragraph 3).
(Choice D)  No, because the arrowheads could have been acquired from other settlements through Jericho's trade economy.  Paragraph 4 describes the view that Jericho relied on a trade-based economy, and that ""the profit obtained from exporting…goods could plausibly account for how and why Jericho occupied its unique position in the ancient Near East.""  However, whether the arrowheads were produced in Jericho or acquired through trade, their discovery would not challenge the claim that ""hunting would have been insufficient to sustain a population of Jericho's size"" (Paragraph 3).  Rather, the arrowheads are evidence that hunting did take place in Jericho, even if that activity was not the primary method by which the city's food was procured."
"99","Which of the following discoveries would most challenge Anati's argument about Jericho's sustenance?","C","18","Anati argues that the Dead Sea indeed played a critical role in Jericho's sustenance, but in a different way, namely, by providing valuable economic resources….  As he points out, tools and ornamental items originating from Anatolia, Sinai, and the Mediterranean coast have been found at ancient Jericho.  More importantly, in surrounding regions ""the Dead Sea has always been the principal source of salt,"" which was ""becoming an indispensable substance [for preparing and preserving food] at exactly the time when Jericho was becoming a walled town.""  The sea would also have yielded large amounts of bitumen, important for fashioning tools and waterproofing containers, as well as sulphur, which even today is ""still used by Bedouin to prepare medicines and to light fires.""  Hence, the profit obtained from exporting these and other goods could plausibly account for how and why Jericho occupied its unique position in the ancient Near East. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 presents Emmanuel Anati's argument that ""the Dead Sea indeed played a critical role in Jericho's sustenance…by providing valuable economic resources"" that facilitated a trade-based economy.  Some evidence of this trade comes from foreign artifacts, such as ""tools and ornamental items originating from Anatolia, Sinai, and the Mediterranean coast...found at ancient Jericho.""  However, Anati treats Jericho's valuable natural resources, especially salt, as even stronger evidence: ""More importantly, in surrounding regions 'the Dead Sea has always been the principal source of salt,' which was 'becoming an indispensable substance [for preparing and preserving food] at exactly the time when Jericho was becoming a walled town.'""
Accordingly, Anati argues that the trade of salt and, to a lesser extent, other resources such as bitumen and sulphur, enabled Jericho to sustain itself as a large, permanent city.  As the author explains, ""[T]he profit obtained from exporting these and other goods could plausibly account for how and why Jericho occupied its unique position in the ancient Near East.""
However, if other settlements had enjoyed easy access to salt, they would have had little need to import it from Jericho, undermining the most important evidence in Anati's argument that Jericho was sustained through a trade-based economy.  Consequently, that argument would be most challenged if salt was a widely available resource throughout many settlements of the ancient Near East.
 By contrast, none of the following discoveries would most challenge Anati's argument:
The importance of sulphur to Bedouin society has increased in modern times compared to what it was in the seventh millennium B.C. (Choice A).  Paragraph 4 notes the value of ""sulphur, which even today is 'still used by Bedouin to prepare medicines and to light fires.'""  However, even if sulphur is more important to Bedouin society today, it could still have also been an important resource in ancient times.
The use of salt was only one method of preparing and preserving food in ancient times (Choice B).  A key point in Anati's argument is the value of salt, ""which was 'becoming an indispensable substance [for preparing and preserving food] at exactly the time when Jericho was becoming a walled town'"" (Paragraph 4).  However, even if there were other methods for preparing and preserving food in ancient times, that fact would not necessarily diminish the importance of salt.  For instance, salt could have represented the simplest or most effective method, which would explain why it was so highly valued.
Items and tools from Sinai and Anatolia are difficult to distinguish from those made in Jericho (Choice D).  This scenario suggests that excavated artifacts believed to be imported ""ornamental items originating from Anatolia, Sinai, and the Mediterranean coast"" (Paragraph 4) could be misidentified objects that were actually produced in Jericho.  However, Anati's argument is primarily based not on the import of such items, but rather on Jericho's access to valuable resources for export, especially salt.  Hence, this discovery would be less challenging to Anati's argument than if salt were widely available throughout the ancient Near East."
"100","Why does the author most likely mention Jericho's defensive ditch and tower?","B","18","Moreover, the city would have been politically unique for its time and region, as constructing the fortifications—including a defensive ditch and tower in addition to the walls—must have required extensive coordination of labor by a strong, centralized leadership.  Other contemporaneous groups were generally much smaller and more loosely organized, often semi-nomadic confederations largely dependent on hunting. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, Jericho ""would have been politically unique for its time and region, as constructing the fortifications—including a defensive ditch and tower in addition to the walls—must have required extensive coordination of labor by a strong, centralized leadership.""  The author also draws the contrast that ""[o]ther contemporaneous groups were generally much smaller and more loosely organized.""
Hence, the passage asserts that Jericho must have had an unusually powerful and centralized political authority because building its fortifications would have been a complex and labor-intensive endeavor.  Therefore, the author most likely mentions Jericho's defensive ditch and tower to emphasize the point that the fortifications represented a significant undertaking.
  By contrast, the author does not most likely mention Jericho's defensive ditch and tower in order:
to emphasize the point that other groups were often semi-nomadic (Choice A).  The author's statement that Jericho's fortifications ""includ[ed] a defensive ditch and tower in addition to the walls"" (Paragraph 2) does not provide any information about other groups.  Moreover, the later information that ""[o]ther contemporaneous groups were…often semi-nomadic confederations largely dependent on hunting"" would be true whether or not Jericho possessed a defensive ditch and tower.  Even if a contrast between Jericho and such nomadic groups is implied, that contrast is based on Jericho's status as a ""large, permanent city"" (Paragraph 3), not specifically on whether fortifications were present.
to emphasize why Jericho's historical record has caused controversy (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 2, if the radiocarbon dates for Jericho are accurate, then Jericho would be ""'the only place in the world where a walled town has been found to date back to nine thousand years ago.'""  Similarly, it would be ""'four thousand years older than any similar settlement known at present.'""  Therefore, the controversy that has ""divided the archaeological community"" (Paragraph 3) is based on the supposed date of Jericho's walls and the difference from other settlements of its time, factors that do not depend on whether Jericho had a defensive ditch and tower.
to emphasize why Jericho's walls have become famous (Choice D).  Although Paragraph 1 states that ""[t]he ancient city of Jericho has long been famous for its walls,"" the passage never suggests that this fame was related to a defensive ditch and tower.  Moreover, the specific mention that such a ditch and tower were included ""in addition to the walls"" (Paragraph 2) suggests that these features of the fortifications are not as widely known as the walls themselves."
"101","Suppose that more advanced methods of radiocarbon dating indicate that Jericho's original walls were constructed around 7400 B.C.  What effect would this discovery have on Robert Braidwood's view as it is described in the passage?","A","18","Initial radiocarbon dating indicated that Jericho's original walls were built in around 6900 to 6800 B.C.  As Emmanuel Anati noted in a 1962 publication, that would not just make Jericho ""the only place in the world where a walled town has been found to date back to nine thousand years ago,"" but also make it ""four thousand years older than any similar settlement known at present."" (Paragraph 2)
These and other considerations have divided the archaeological community, with scholars such as Robert Braidwood stating that the supposed radiocarbon dates are too early and must be wrong. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 2, ""[i]nitial radiocarbon dating indicated that Jericho's original walls were built in around 6900 to 6800 B.C.""  Those dates are historically significant because if they are accurate, then ""that would not just make Jericho 'the only place in the world where a walled town has been found to date back to nine thousand years ago,' but also make it 'four thousand years older than any similar settlement known at present.'""  Paragraph 3 then points out that ""[t]hese and other considerations have divided the archaeological community, with scholars such as Robert Braidwood stating that the supposed radiocarbon dates are too early and must be wrong.""
Therefore, Braidwood's argument that the radiocarbon dates must be wrong is based on the belief that those dates are too early.  In other words, he objects to the conclusion that a walled town had existed millennia before any other known similar settlements.  However, if more advanced methods of radiocarbon dating indicated that Jericho's original walls were constructed around 7400 B.C., then those walls would have existed even earlier than the initial dating indicated.  In that case, Braidwood's view would be challenged; Jericho's walls would be even older than originally supposed.
  (Choice B)  Braidwood's view would be challenged; Jericho's walls would be even stronger evidence of a trade economy.  Although Braidwood argued that ""the supposed radiocarbon dates…must be wrong"" (Paragraph 3), this claim is meant to dispute the idea that Jericho was ""'four thousand years older than any similar settlement known at present'"" (Paragraph 2).  Paragraph 4 presents Emmanuel Anati's view that ""'Only trade comes seriously into consideration'"" as an explanation for Jericho's sustenance, but the passage never suggests that Braidwood's view is concerned with whether Jericho possessed a trade economy.
(Choices C and D)  Braidwood's view would be unaffected; he makes no reference to different methods of radiocarbon dating; and Braidwood's view would be supported; he correctly stated that the original radiocarbon dates must be wrong.  According to Paragraph 3, Braidwood claimed that ""the supposed radiocarbon dates are too early and must be wrong.""  Hence, he argued that Jericho could not be as old as those radiocarbon dates suggested.  Therefore, the discovery that Jericho was even older than originally conjectured would challenge (not support) Braidwood's view.  Furthermore, this conclusion does not depend on whether Braidwood referred to different methods of radiocarbon dating; it is based only on Braidwood's claim that Jericho could not be as old as that dating would suggest."
"102","Which of the following could be considered an inconsistency in Descartes' approach?","C","19","Into this collapsing Weltanschauung was born René Descartes—a thinker seemingly destined to become the symbol of a new totalizing skepticism as well as the progenitor of a rationalism so absolute it promised to unite the sciences and philosophy into a single system of thought.  Less overtly, however, Descartes would embody the irreconcilable differences of an age in which faith and reason, superstition and science, and alchemy and chemistry vied with one another. (Paragraph 1)
The rational thinker was convinced that these overpowering dreams had descended ""from above.""  As reported by his earliest biographer, Adrien Baillet, Descartes ""thought he could perceive through their shadows the signs of a path which God had marked out for him"" because of his commitment to the truth.  Thus, this rising ""Father of Modern Philosophy"" whose instinct was to doubt everything drew the inspiration for his theories from the elusive realm of dreams. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 1, ""Descartes [was] a thinker seemingly destined to become the symbol of a new totalizing skepticism as well as the progenitor (parent) of a rationalism so absolute it promised to unite the sciences and philosophy into a single system of thought.""  Similarly, Paragraph 5 states that Descartes was inclined to ""doubt everything.""  However, as Paragraph 5 also conveys, ""[t]he rational thinker was convinced that these overpowering dreams had descended 'from above.'""
Furthermore, according to his first biographer, Descartes believed he could discern in these dreams ""the signs of a path which God had marked out for him'"" because he was seeking the truth.  Accordingly, this ""rising 'Father of Modern Philosophy' whose instinct was to doubt everything drew the inspiration for his [rational] theories from the elusive realm of dreams.""
Thus, Descartes' position exhibits a marked tension: having assumed a skeptical attitude of doubt and promoted rationality, he nevertheless trusted what he believed to be the message of his dreams, which seems irrational or unscientific.  Consequently, trusting in transient (ie, quickly vanishing) visions while adopting a relentlessly skeptical mindset could be considered an inconsistency in Descartes' approach.
 By contrast, none of the following could be considered an inconsistency in Descartes' approach:
designing a broad philosophical system while witnessing Scholasticism's collapse (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 1, ""Scholasticism—that longstanding but unwieldy edifice (structure) of Catholic dogma buttressed (supported) by Aristotelian reasoning—was now tottering.""  In contrast, Descartes was ""destined to become…the progenitor of a rationalism so absolute it promised to unite the sciences and philosophy into a single system of thought.""  He thus sought to design a broad philosophical system that would be based on an absolute and unifying certainty.  Therefore, Descartes did not object to the broadness of philosophical systems like Scholasticism but to their lack of certainty.
committing to rationalism while fiercely opposing Aristotelian philosophy (Choice B).  Paragraph 1 describes Scholasticism as ""Catholic dogma buttressed (supported) by Aristotelian reasoning.""  By contrast, the passage describes Descartes' goal as ""a rationalism so absolute it promised to unite the sciences and philosophy into a single system"" and states that he scorned the Scholasticism or ""'rehashed Aristotle encrusted with centuries of interpretations'"" he had been taught (Paragraph 2).  Thus, Descartes objected to the interpretations of Aristotelian reasoning (rationality).  However, the passage never suggests that he rejected all rational thinking or opposed Aristotelian philosophy in general.
wavering over philosophy's purpose while harshly judging the work of other philosophers (Choice D).  Paragraph 2 indicates that Descartes ""felt only scorn for the steady diet he had been fed of 'rehashed Aristotle encrusted with centuries of interpretations.'""  Furthermore, ""[b]elieving that mathematics alone afforded certainty, he nimbly circumvented (avoided)…'the morass of metaphysics,'"" or the existing theories about the nature of reality.  Therefore, although Descartes had a negative view of other philosophers' work, he was clear that philosophy's overarching purpose was to achieve certainty."
"103","Based on the passage, which of the following inferences can most reasonably be drawn about Scholasticism?","D","19","By the seventeenth century, the noxious fumes of epistemological doubt were rapidly seeping into the sensibility of the European intelligentsia.  Society had been left reeling from the world-altering discoveries and inventions of the past two centuries.  Additionally, the seismic shifts of the Renaissance and Reformation had set churchmen at odds with other thinkers and ignited devastating religious wars.  Scholasticism—that longstanding but unwieldy edifice of Catholic dogma buttressed by Aristotelian reasoning—was now tottering. (Paragraph 1
According to Paragraph 1, by Descartes' time, traditional ideas were beginning to be challenged: ""[T]he noxious (harmful) fumes of epistemological doubt (ie, doubt about what can truly be known) were rapidly seeping into the sensibility of the European intelligentsia.""  Furthermore, the massive changes brought about by the Renaissance and Reformation ""had set churchmen at odds with other thinkers.""  As a result, ""Scholasticism—that longstanding but unwieldy edifice (structure) of Catholic dogma (authoritative principles or teachings) buttressed (supported) by Aristotelian reasoning—was now tottering.""
Accordingly, the passage indicates that although churchmen may have continued to embrace Scholasticism during these unstable times, other thinkers had already begun to reject its doctrines (teachings).  Therefore, based on the passage, the most reasonable inference that can be drawn about Scholasticism is that it was less likely to appeal to purely philosophical thinkers than to churchmen.
 By contrast, none of the following inferences about Scholasticism can reasonably be drawn:
It was a system of thought meant to liberate the church from secular influences (Choice A).  Paragraph 1 describes Scholasticism as ""Catholic dogma buttressed by Aristotelian reasoning.""  Thus, this system of thought combined church teachings with the secular or nonreligious thinking of the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle.  Consequently, Scholasticism was meant to harmonize nonreligious thinking with church doctrine rather than to free the church from secular influences.
It was revised due to the intense personal visions of thinkers such as Descartes (Choice B).  Paragraph 1 indicates that as a result of the ""world-altering discoveries"" and ""the seismic shifts"" of the preceding centuries, Scholasticism was already ""tottering"" when Descartes expressed his disdain for this ""'rehashed Aristotle'"" (Paragraph 2) and then experienced his visions.  However, the passage never suggests that the intellectual system of Scholasticism was revised due to Descartes' dreams—or the intense personal visions of any thinkers like him.
It was particularly reassuring to a society being rocked by constant upheavals (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 1, the ""longstanding"" intellectual system of Scholasticism was ""unwieldy"" and, by Descartes' time, was ""tottering"" due to the constant social upheavals of the preceding centuries.  Therefore, the passage suggests that Scholasticism was itself crumbling beneath the strain of those upheavals; it never suggests that Scholasticism was seen as a source of reassurance to a society experiencing such shifts."
"104","Given the information presented in Paragraph 2, which of the following assertions most accurately describes Descartes' attitude toward philosophy?","B","19","By the time Descartes had completed his preliminary education and entered law school, he was thoroughly disillusioned.  As Paul Strathern notes, the would-be philosopher felt only scorn for the steady diet he had been fed of ""rehashed Aristotle encrusted with centuries of interpretations.""  Believing that mathematics alone afforded certainty, he nimbly circumvented what Strathern calls ""the morass of metaphysics""….  [I]n the Netherlands, he encountered Dutch mathematician and thinker Isaac Beeckman, who renewed his appetite for original thought.  Descartes began to imagine that by applying the laws of mathematics to philosophy he could achieve the certainty he craved. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, Descartes had become ""thoroughly disillusioned"" with the philosophy that he had learned in school.  In fact, he ""felt only scorn for the steady diet he had been fed of 'rehashed Aristotle encrusted with centuries of interpretations.'""  Moreover, ""[b]elieving that mathematics alone afforded certainty,"" Descartes turned away from ""'the morass of metaphysics,'"" or what seemed to be a confused collection of theories about the nature of reality.  Subsequent interactions with the mathematician Isaac Beeckman led Descartes to think that ""by applying the laws of mathematics to philosophy he could achieve the certainty he craved.""
Accordingly, Descartes viewed the philosophy of his day as lacking originality and certainty; he believed that accepted philosophical ideas needed to be reexamined, particularly in the light of mathematical laws.  Therefore, the assertion that philosophy ought to scrutinize even established ideas most accurately describes Descartes' attitude toward philosophy.


(Choice A)  Philosophy ought to focus on metaphysical ideas.  As Paragraph 2 states, ""Believing that mathematics alone afforded certainty, [Descartes] nimbly circumvented (avoided)…'the morass (bog) of metaphysics, or the confused collection of theories of reality.'""  Accordingly, Descartes believed that philosophy should not focus on metaphysical ideas but turn away from them; it should look instead to the certainty that mathematics can provide.
(Choices C and D)  Philosophy ought to elaborate on previous thinkers' theories; and Philosophy ought to treat established ideas as indispensable.  Paragraph 2 notes that Descartes scorned the ""'rehashed Aristotle encrusted with centuries of interpretations'"" that still prevailed.  Furthermore, he believed ""that mathematics alone afforded certainty"" and so made sure to avoid ""'the morass of metaphysics,'"" which included the currently accepted but confused ideas about the nature of reality.  Thus, Descartes saw previous thinkers' theories as no longer vital and established metaphysical ideas as needing to be dispensed with.  Philosophy, he thought, should be overhauled to achieve the certainty found in mathematics.  Therefore, Descartes did not believe that philosophy ought to reinterpret or elaborate on the theories of the thinkers who came before him, nor that it ought to treat established ideas as indispensable."
"105","Based on the passage, Descartes most likely left school and joined the army in order to:","D","19","By the time Descartes had completed his preliminary education and entered law school, he was thoroughly disillusioned.  As Paul Strathern notes, the would-be philosopher felt only scorn for the steady diet he had been fed of ""rehashed Aristotle encrusted with centuries of interpretations.""  Believing that mathematics alone afforded certainty, he nimbly circumvented what Strathern calls ""the morass of metaphysics.""  Abandoning his studies and seeing the Thirty Years' War raging through Europe, the now aimless youth enlisted as a volunteer in the army.  While garrisoned in the Netherlands, he encountered Dutch mathematician and thinker Isaac Beeckman, who renewed his appetite for original thought.  Descartes began to imagine that by applying the laws of mathematics to philosophy he could achieve the certainty he craved. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, ""By the time Descartes had completed his preliminary education and entered law school, he was thoroughly disillusioned"" and hated ""the steady diet he had been fed of 'rehashed Aristotle encrusted with centuries of interpretations.'""  Furthermore, he sought to avoid ""'the morass of metaphysics'""—or what could be seen as a confused collection of theories about the nature of reality—as he believed it lacked the certainty of mathematics.  Consequently, ""[a]bandoning his studies and seeing the Thirty Years' War raging through Europe, the now aimless youth enlisted as a volunteer in the army.""
This information indicates that when Descartes decided to join the army, he was completely frustrated with both school and the state of philosophy, specifically the unoriginal thinking exemplified by Scholasticism and the established metaphysical ideas he felt lacked certainty.  Therefore, Descartes most likely joined the army in order to escape the current intellectual climate in which he found himself immersed.
 By contrast, Descartes most likely did not leave school and join the army in order to:
pursue his designated mission in life (Choice A).  Paragraph 2 suggests only that Descartes was ""disillusioned"" with the unoriginal thinking exemplified by the ""'rehashed Aristotle encrusted with centuries of interpretations'"" he had been taught.  A ""now aimless youth,"" he volunteered for the army.  Later, through his interactions with Beeckman and subsequent visions, Descartes discovered his personal mission in life, namely, to achieve philosophical certainty.  Accordingly, the passage shows that when he left school and joined the army Descartes was ""aimless""—that is, without a designated mission in life.
use his adventures to reenvision philosophy (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 2, ""By the time Descartes…entered law school, he was thoroughly disillusioned,"" particularly with the ""'rehashed Aristotle encrusted with centuries of interpretations'"" he had been taught.  He also believed ""that mathematics alone afforded certainty"" and that metaphysical ideas should be avoided.  Being a ""now aimless youth,"" he decided to join the army.  While serving, he encountered Beeckman and ""began to imagine that by applying the laws of mathematics to philosophy he could achieve the certainty he craved.""  Therefore, although Descartes would later be intent on reenvisioning philosophy, the passage never suggests that this was his motivation when he left school and joined the army.
support the war effort through its conclusion (Choice C).  Paragraph 2 states that ""the now aimless youth enlisted as a volunteer in the army.""  However, the passage never indicates that the ""aimless"" Descartes planned to serve in the army for the duration of the war or for any specified amount of time."
"106","In the description of Descartes' dreams (Paragraph 4), the author's reference to the title of the Ausonius poem ""Which path in life will I choose?"" can best be viewed as:","D","19","In the first dream, Descartes found himself pursued by apparitions while fierce whirlwinds prevented him from retreating inside a church.  He awoke, only to be terrorized by a second vision in which a lightning bolt flooded his room with countless sparks.  Finally, in a third dream, a dictionary and a poetry anthology materialized on a table next to him.  He opened the anthology to a verse by the late Latin poet Ausonius entitled, ""Which path in life will I choose?""  The shadowy figure of a man appeared and recommended another poem beginning with the Pythagorean phrase ""Yes and No."" (Paragraph 4)
While still slumbering, Descartes began to decipher this last dream: the dictionary represented the sciences, whereas the poetry anthology symbolized the union between wisdom and philosophy,"" and ""Yes and No"" alluded to the accuracy or error of human understanding.  Upon waking, he interpreted the winds from the first dream as forces directing him away from Scholasticism and the lightning bolt of the second as ""the signal of the Spirit of Truth.  The rational thinker was convinced that these overpowering dreams had descended ""from above.""  As reported by his earliest biographer, Adrien Baillet, Descartes ""thought he could perceive through their shadows the signs of a path which God had marked out for him"" because of his commitment to the truth. (Paragraph 5)
As Paragraph 4 details, Descartes experienced a series of three dreams or visions.  In the first, he was prevented from entering a church; in the second, his room was filled with lightning sparks; in the third, ""a dictionary and a poetry anthology materialized on a table next to him.  He opened the anthology to a verse by the late Latin poet Ausonius entitled, 'Which path in life will I choose?'""
Paragraph 5 conveys Descartes' interpretation of some of the content of these dreams.  In the third dream, according to Descartes, ""the dictionary represented the sciences, whereas the poetry anthology symbolized the union between wisdom and philosophy.""  Furthermore, he ""interpreted the winds from the first dream as forces directing him away from Scholasticism and the lightning bolt of the second as 'the signal of the Spirit of Truth.""'
These interpretations are consistent with Descartes' disillusionment, as related in Paragraph 2, with the ""rehashed Aristotle"" he had been taught, his avoidance of current metaphysical ideas as confused, and his desire for the certainty only mathematics seemed to provide.  Thus, as an ""aimless youth,"" Descartes left school, abandoning philosophical pursuits to join the army.  When it came to these dreams, the budding philosopher ""'thought he could perceive through their shadows the signs of a path which God had marked out for him'"" (Paragraph 5) because he was dedicated to the truth.
Consequently, the contents of the dreams, including the title of the poem, reflect aspects of Descartes' situation at the time and his desire to achieve certainty and truth in philosophy.  Therefore, in the description of Descartes' dreams (Paragraph 4), the author's reference to the title of the Ausonius poem ""Which path in life will I choose?"" can best be viewed as symbolically meaningful.
 (Choice A)  rhetorically unnecessary.  In Paragraph 4, the author supplies the details of Descartes' dream, including the title of the Ausonius poem ""Which path in life will I choose?""  Those details are symbolic of Descartes' philosophical situation and the role of his dreams in motivating his mission.  Therefore, the author's reference to the title of the poem is relevant to connecting Descartes' dreams with his mission.  Consequently, the title's inclusion is best viewed as a significant detail rather than an unnecessary bit of rhetoric.
(Choices B and C)  purposely misleading; and likely embellished.  Paragraph 2 portrays Descartes as an ""aimless youth"" who, ""disillusioned"" with his education and the state of philosophy, was uncertain about his life's direction.  Later, Descartes experienced dreams that he purportedly believed conveyed '''the signs of a path which God had marked out for him' because of his commitment to the truth"" (Paragraph 5).  Accordingly, the poem's title, ""Which path in life will I choose?"" reflects Descartes' lack of direction at the time.  Therefore, the reference to the title is best viewed as meaningful and relevant; the passage does not suggest that it is deliberately misleading, nor that it is embellished or exaggerated for emphasis."
"107","Based on the final paragraph, which of the following best describes how the passage author portrays Descartes' philosophical position?  Descartes' position is:","A","19","Into this collapsing Weltanschauung was born René Descartes—a thinker seemingly destined to become the symbol of a new totalizing skepticism as well as the progenitor of a rationalism so absolute it promised to unite the sciences and philosophy into a single system of thought.  Less overtly, however, Descartes would embody the irreconcilable differences of an age in which faith and reason, superstition and science, and alchemy and chemistry vied with one another. (Paragraph 1)
The rational thinker was convinced that these overpowering dreams had descended ""from above.""  As reported by his earliest biographer, Adrien Baillet, Descartes ""thought he could perceive through their shadows the signs of a path which God had marked out for him"" because of his commitment to the truth.  Thus, this rising ""Father of Modern Philosophy"" whose instinct was to doubt everything drew the inspiration for his theories from the elusive realm of dreams. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 1, Descartes would come to symbolize ""a new totalizing skepticism"" and was ""the progenitor (parent) of a rationalism so absolute it promised to unite the sciences and philosophy into a single system of thought.""  However, Descartes also ""would embody the irreconcilable differences of an age in which faith and reason, superstition and science, and alchemy and chemistry vied with one another.""
Paragraph 5 reveals how Descartes exemplified this tension between opposites.  Descartes ""was convinced"" that the dreams he experienced ""'had descended 'from above.'""  Indeed, he thought that these visions had been sent to indicate his personal philosophical mission in life, that they were ""'the signs of a path which God had marked out for him'"" because he was seeking the truth.  However, the last sentence highlights an apparent inconsistency, namely, that ""this rising 'Father of Modern Philosophy' whose instinct was to doubt everything drew the inspiration for his theories from the elusive realm of dreams.""
Accordingly, Descartes' apparent conviction that the content of his dreams was meaningful is not consistent with the firmly rational and radically skeptical position the author ascribes to him.  Therefore, the author portrays Descartes' philosophical position as ironic, or the opposite of what one would expect.
 By contrast, the author does not portray Descartes' position as being:
predictable (Choice B).  Paragraph 5 describes Descartes as someone ""whose instinct was to doubt everything.""  However, Descartes also ""drew the inspiration for his theories from the elusive realm of dreams.""  Given the descriptions of Descartes as a thinker inclined toward skepticism and doubt, one would not expect or predict that he would trust information readily—particularly information communicated through dream phenomena.
unvarying (Choice C).  The author emphasizes that Descartes ""[l]ess overtly…embod[ied] the irreconcilable differences"" of his times (Paragraph 1) and that ""this rising 'Father of Modern Philosophy' whose instinct was to doubt everything drew the inspiration for his theories from the elusive realm of dreams"" (Paragraph 5).  Accordingly, the author portrays the philosophical position of this purportedly rational and skeptical thinker as being inconsistent or varying rather than unvarying.
frivolous (Choice D).  The author conveys that Descartes' position is inconsistent because although he embraced rationality and his ""instinct was to doubt everything,"" he nevertheless ""drew the inspiration for his theories from the elusive world of dreams"" (Paragraph 5).  However, while the author describes Descartes' position as inconsistent, he or she never suggests that this inconsistency makes his philosophical position frivolous (ie, trivial or silly)."
"108","Why does the author most likely mention Isaac Beeckman (Paragraph 2)?","C","19","By the time Descartes had completed his preliminary education and entered law school, he was thoroughly disillusioned.  As Paul Strathern notes, the would-be philosopher felt only scorn for the steady diet he had been fed of ""rehashed Aristotle encrusted with centuries of interpretations.""  Believing that mathematics alone afforded certainty, he nimbly circumvented what Strathern calls ""the morass of metaphysics.""  Abandoning his studies and seeing the Thirty Years' War raging through Europe, the now aimless youth enlisted as a volunteer in the army.  While garrisoned in the Netherlands, he encountered Dutch mathematician and thinker Isaac Beeckman, who renewed his appetite for original thought.  Descartes began to imagine that by applying the laws of mathematics to philosophy he could achieve the certainty he craved. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 describes Descartes as ""thoroughly disillusioned"" by the '""rehashed Aristotle encrusted with centuries of interpretations'"" that he had been taught in school.  In Descartes' view, ""mathematics alone afforded certainty.""  Having left school and joined the army, he met Isaac Beeckman, a Dutch mathematician and thinker.  Through interactions with Beeckman, Descartes' ""appetite for original thought"" was revived; specifically, he ""began to imagine that by applying the laws of mathematics to philosophy he could achieve the certainty he craved.""
Accordingly, the author mentions Isaac Beeckman as part of the narrative of Descartes' life and of the context of that time.  The passage then continues its discussion of Descartes and his philosophical breakthrough without further reference to Beeckman.  Therefore, the most likely reason that the author mentions Isaac Beeckman (Paragraph 2) is to supply historical facts.
 By contrast, the author does not most likely mention Isaac Beeckman:
to challenge Descartes' originality (Choice A).  The author mentions Isaac Beeckman as someone instrumental in renewing Descartes' ""appetite for original thought"" (Paragraph 2).  Accordingly, the author suggests that Beeckman inspired Descartes to pursue his own original thoughts and ideas; however, he or she never suggests that Beeckman's influence made Descartes' thinking any less original.
to highlight another important thinker (Choice B).  In Paragraph 2, the author mentions ""Dutch mathematician and thinker Isaac Beeckman"" as someone who was able to renew Descartes' ""appetite for original thought.""  However, the passage continues to focus on Descartes without further reference to Beeckman.  Accordingly, the author's purpose is most likely not to highlight Beeckman's importance as a thinker, but simply to cite his influence on Descartes.
to suggest the superiority of mathematics (Choice D).  In Paragraph 2, the author mentions ""Dutch mathematician and thinker Isaac Beeckman"" as someone who inspired Descartes' ""appetite for original thought.""  As the author explains, interacting with Beeckman led Descartes ""to imagine that by applying the laws of mathematics to philosophy he could achieve the certainty he craved.""  However, although the mention of Beeckman relates to Descartes' view that mathematics was superior to other disciplines, the author never expresses that view as his or her own."
"109","Based on the author's description, the behavior of the prosecutor in Paragraph 1 is most like that of:","C","20","Suppose a prosecutor is considering whether to bring a case to trial.  He is not sure that the suspect is guilty—in fact, based on the evidence, it's more likely that the suspect is not guilty.  Nevertheless, he feels confident he can secure a guilty verdict.  His powers of persuasion are considerable, and there's a good chance he could trick a jury into believing the evidence is strong instead of weak.  In addition, the case is high profile and could be very lucrative; winning would likely lead to a substantial raise or promotion.  He decides to charge the suspect, and ultimately succeeds in persuading the jury to convict. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 describes a hypothetical situation in which a prosecutor brings a case to trial purely for personal gain.  Even though ""it's more likely that the suspect is not guilty,"" the prosecutor ""feels confident he can secure a guilty verdict.""  Accordingly, since winning the case ""would likely lead to a substantial raise or promotion,"" he tricks a jury into convicting a suspect who is probably innocent.
Based on that description, the prosecutor treats the suspect unjustly in order to personally profit.  Therefore, this prosecutor's behavior is most like that of a casting director who sabotages a more talented actor's audition so she can take the part herself.  If that actor is more talented, then they deserve to have the part.  Consequently, by sabotaging the actor's audition to give the part to herself, the casting director treats the actor unjustly for the sake of her own profit.
 (Choice A)  a college admissions officer who ignores a student's personal essay so she can focus on judging academic performance.  In this situation, there is no indication that the admissions officer is motivated by personal gain.  Furthermore, it is also not evident that the student suffers due to the officer's decision; for instance, that decision would actually benefit a student who performed well academically but wrote a subpar essay.  Therefore, the admissions officer's behavior is unlike that of the prosecutor, who charges a probably innocent suspect because ""winning [the case] would likely lead to a substantial raise or promotion"" (Paragraph 1).
(Choice B)  a hiring manager who sabotages a more qualified candidate's application so she can give the job to her friend.  The hiring manager does treat the more qualified candidate unjustly in order to achieve a personal goal.  However, this goal is to help her friend rather than to gain financially; by contrast, the prosecutor is motivated by the prospect of his own ""substantial raise or promotion"" (Paragraph 1).  Therefore, although the hiring manager is similar to the prosecutor in some respects, there is also a relevant difference between their actions.
(Choice D)  a restaurant manager who fires her head chef so she can hire a more experienced one to improve her menu.  Although the restaurant manager causes the head chef to suffer, it is not clear that she has treated the chef unjustly.  For example, if the chef's lack of experience led to poor performance on the job, then the manager would be justified in replacing the chef.  By contrast, in the question scenario, the prosecutor is not justified in charging the suspect because ""it's more likely that the suspect is not guilty"" (Paragraph 1).  Therefore, the behavior of the restaurant manager may be very different from that of the prosecutor."
"110","The author argues that it is unethical for defense attorneys to take certain defendants as clients.  However, the Sixth Amendment guarantees every defendant the right to legal representation.  Can the author's argument accommodate this fact?","B","20","Paid handsomely to represent even the vilest of clients, they apply their oratorical prowess to manipulating jury perception, keeping the guilty free and unpunished in exchange for money and status.  To the extent that this behavior takes place, are some defense attorneys as unethical as our hypothetical prosecutor? (Paragraph 2)
With the exception of court-appointed attorneys or public defenders, who are assigned to provide representation to those who would otherwise lack it, an attorney is never required to represent a defendant.  Therefore, meeting one's obligations as a defense attorney does not necessarily make one ethical, because the choice to accept a specific case (and thus to incur those obligations in the first place) may itself be an unethical act. (Paragraph 4)
Moreover, the role of court-appointed attorneys is to help protect the rights of citizens who cannot secure their own representation, usually for financial reasons. (Paragraph 5)
For those who strive to ensure citizens' rights, or who truly believe their clients are innocent, providing a defense is a noble undertaking.  But for those whose overriding motivation is greed, that legally ""zealous defense"" is ethically indefensible. (Paragraph 6)
The author argues that it is unethical for defense attorneys to choose to represent guilty defendants.  For instance, Paragraph 2 denounces defense attorneys who ""represent even the vilest of clients…keeping the guilty free and unpunished in exchange for money and status.""  Likewise, Paragraph 4 states that ""the choice to accept a specific case…may itself be an unethical act.""  Finally, Paragraph 6 calls it ""ethically indefensible"" for a lawyer to defend the guilty out of greed.
However, the author also points out that while some attorneys can choose their clients, others do not have this choice: ""With the exception of court-appointed attorneys or public defenders, who are assigned to provide representation to those who would otherwise lack it, an attorney is never required to represent a defendant"" (Paragraph 4).  In other words, only private attorneys can decide whether or not to accept any particular client.  By contrast, public attorneys must represent anyone to whom they are assigned, ""to help protect the rights of citizens who cannot secure their own representation"" (Paragraph 5).
Therefore, even if every private defense attorney accepted the author's argument, the existence of public attorneys would still ensure the right of all citizens to legal representation.  Accordingly, the author's argument can accommodate the Sixth Amendment's guarantee because the author's ethical claim applies specifically to private attorneys.
 (Choice A)  Yes, because the needed reforms to the legal system could include the Sixth Amendment.  Although the author proposes reforms to the legal system, they assert that these ""needed reforms must come from individual attorneys committing to work for the right reasons.""  In addition, the author never suggests that the right to representation should be altered.  Rather, they affirm this right's importance by stating that ""[f]or those who strive to ensure citizens' rights…providing a defense is a noble undertaking"" (Paragraph 6).
(Choice C)  No, because if all attorneys accepted the author's argument, then some defendants could not get representation.  If all attorneys accepted the author's argument, then certain defendants could not get representation from private defense attorneys.  However, this change would not affect public defense attorneys, such as ""court-appointed attorneys or public defenders, who are assigned to provide representation to those who would otherwise lack it"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, even if all attorneys accepted the author's argument, the defendants in question would still receive representation.
(Choice D)  No, because a collective refusal to represent certain defendants could lead to innocent people being convicted.  The author argues that defense attorneys should not sell their services to people who actually are guilty.  For example, Paragraph 2 refers to lawyers who ""represent even the vilest of clients…keeping the guilty free and unpunished in exchange for money and status.""  However, the author also states that when attorneys ""truly believe their clients are innocent, providing a defense is a noble undertaking"" (Paragraph 6).  Therefore, the collective refusal the author advocates applies only to defendants who are probably guilty.  Accordingly, this refusal would be unlikely to cause more innocent people to be convicted."
"111","A 1993 opinion of the D.C. Bar stated that in certain situations, a defense attorney who discovers their client intends to lie on the stand cannot choose to withdraw from the case.  How is this opinion most relevant to the information in the passage?","B","20","It is worth distinguishing two senses of the word ""ethical"" here.  For there are standards of professional ethics to which any attorney must conform, including standards particular to the defense.  Most relevant to our purposes, a lawyer is obligated to provide their client with a ""zealous defense.""  In other words, once an attorney takes on a client, they are ethically bound to promote that client's rights, interests, or innocence—in fact, not to do so would be unethical.  Thus, one might try to suggest that this obligation undermines the claim that some defense attorneys act unethically. (Paragraph 3)
However, meeting that professional standard is not the same as being ethical in the general sense of the word….  Therefore, meeting one's obligations as a defense attorney does not necessarily make one ethical, because the choice to accept a specific case (and thus to incur those obligations in the first place) may itself be an unethical act. (Paragraph 4)
Part of the author's argument involves distinguishing between two types of ethics: one that is specific to a profession, and one that relates to a general sense of right and wrong.  Paragraph 3 discusses the first type, noting that there are ""standards of professional ethics to which any attorney must conform.""  For example, a defense attorney who represents a client is ""ethically bound to promote that client's rights, interests, or innocence.""
Paragraph 4 contrasts this obligation with the more general type of ethics.  A defense attorney who knows their client is guilty would still have a professional duty to defend that client.  However, it would be wrong overall if that defense was successful because the guilty client would escape justice.  Accordingly, the author asserts that ""meeting that professional standard is not the same as being ethical in the general sense of the word.""
Similarly, the question scenario illustrates this distinction between professional ethics and ethics in general.  In terms of right or wrong, attorneys may want to withdraw from a case when they know their client intends to lie.  However, the D.C. Bar opinion states that in certain situations, those lawyers may not do so—instead, they are obligated as lawyers to continue defending the lying client.  Therefore, this opinion exemplifies a tension between attorneys' professional obligations and ethics in general.
 (Choice A)  It shows that an attorney's motivations may be ethically indefensible.  Paragraph 6 states that it is ""ethically indefensible"" if a lawyer whose ""overriding motivation is greed"" defends a guilty client.  However, in the scenario described, the lawyer wants to withdraw from the case because they know their client plans to lie.  Therefore, the lawyer's motivations are to uphold the truth and not defend a guilty client, which is the opposite of the ""indefensible"" conduct the passage describes.
(Choice C)  It explains why reforms to the system must come from individual attorneys.  In Paragraph 6, the author writes that ""the needed reforms to the system must come from individual attorneys committing to work for the right reasons.""  However, in the D.C. Bar's opinion, a lawyer may not be allowed to withdraw from a case even if they discover their client is lying.  In that situation, an attorney would be attempting to act from the ""right reasons"" the author refers to, but would be prevented from doing so by the system itself.  Therefore, this opinion would not explain why reforms to the system must come from individual attorneys.
(Choice D)  It illustrates the effect of wealth and class disparities on defense attorney ethics.  According to Paragraph 5, ""wealth and class contribute to injustice"" because only the wealthy can afford to hire ""top-level private lawyers.""  However, the scenario described makes no reference to the wealth or class of the lawyer's client, only the fact that the client intends to lie.  Therefore, while the D.C. Bar's opinion does relate to defense attorney ethics, there is no indication that it relates to wealth and class disparities."
"112","The claim that most people would easily view the hypothetical prosecutor as unethical is used to support the assertion that:","D","20","Looking at this situation, most of us would easily judge the prosecutor as extremely unethical.  His conduct is outrageous and wrong—he clearly acted with corrupt intent, perpetrating injustice in order to profit financially.  Why is it not shocking, then, that we tolerate the mirror image of this behavior from defense attorneys?  For they engage in the same outrageous conduct, only on the other side.  Paid handsomely to represent even the vilest of clients, they apply their oratorical prowess to manipulating jury perception, keeping the guilty free and unpunished in exchange for money and status.  To the extent that this behavior takes place, are some defense attorneys as unethical as our hypothetical prosecutor? (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, most people would quickly agree that the hypothetical prosecutor is ""extremely unethical"" and that ""[h]is conduct is outrageous and wrong.""  The author then poses the rhetorical question: ""Why is it not shocking, then, that we tolerate the mirror image of this behavior from defense attorneys?  For they engage in the same outrageous conduct, only on the other side.""
By referencing ""the same outrageous conduct,"" the author implies that people should judge some defense attorneys just as harshly as they would judge the hypothetical prosecutor.  Thus, the author conveys that it is ""shocking"" that people typically do not judge them that way but instead ""tolerate the mirror image of this behavior"" (Paragraph 2).
Consequently, the claim that most people would easily view the hypothetical prosecutor as unethical is used to support the assertion that it is strange that we accept the behavior of defense attorneys.
 (Choices A and C)  defense attorneys represent even the vilest of clients; and defense attorneys are mirror images of the hypothetical prosecutor.  Both of these answer choices get the author's argument backwards.  The author does not suggest that because the hypothetical prosecutor is unethical, some defense attorneys defend vile clients and act like the prosecutor's mirror image.  Rather, the author suggests that because some defense attorneys defend vile clients and act like the prosecutor's mirror image, those defense attorneys are as unethical as the prosecutor.
(Choice B)  prosecutors can be just as unethical as defense attorneys.  The passage describes a hypothetical scenario in which a prosecutor engages in ""extremely unethical"" conduct (Paragraph 2).  However, the author never suggests that any actual prosecutors engage in such conduct; rather, the scenario is designed to show that some real-life defense attorneys behave unethically."
"113","If statistics suggest that the effectiveness of a legal defense correlates positively with the expense of securing it, which of the following conclusions would be reasonable?
The most talented defense attorneys tend to be hired by private firms rather than government agencies.
Increasing the funding available to public defenders would give disadvantaged citizens more effective representation.
Highly paid lawyers face more professional obligations in taking on clients than lesser paid lawyers.","C","20","Moreover, the role of court-appointed attorneys is to help protect the rights of citizens who cannot secure their own representation, usually for financial reasons.  Although preserving those rights is necessary to uphold justice, this situation highlights how wealth and class contribute to injustice.  While some defendants possess the means to hire top-level private lawyers, others must depend on public servants—frequently less experienced lawyers from overloaded, understaffed agencies.  As a result, the rich are more likely to escape conviction even when they are guilty, and the poor are more likely to be convicted even when they are innocent. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, wealthy people can afford ""top-level private lawyers"" while persons of lower income must turn to ""public servants—frequently less experienced lawyers from overloaded, understaffed agencies.""  Therefore, statistics suggesting that the effectiveness of a legal defense correlates positively with the expense of securing it would support the idea that most ""top-level"" lawyers work at private firms.  Consequently, it would be reasonable to conclude that the most talented defense attorneys tend to be hired by private firms rather than government agencies (Number I).
Paragraph 5 conveys that those who are financially disadvantaged ""must depend on public servants"" for legal representation.  However, these public servants are ""frequently less experienced lawyers from overloaded, understaffed agencies.""  Accordingly, the quality of that representation suffers: ""the rich are more likely to escape conviction even when they are guilty, and the poor are more likely to be convicted even when they are innocent.""
Therefore, if statistics suggest that the effectiveness of a legal defense correlates positively with the expense of securing it, that would mean that providing more resources to public servants would help them provide higher quality defenses.  Thus, it would be reasonable to conclude that increasing the funding available to public defenders would give disadvantaged citizens more effective representation (Number II).
 (Number III)  In Paragraph 4, the author notes that private attorneys can choose their clients, but public attorneys cannot: ""With the exception of court-appointed attorneys or public defenders, who are assigned to provide representation to those who would otherwise lack it, an attorney is never required to represent a defendant.""  Paragraph 5 then indicates that private attorneys are more highly paid, as they are hired by the wealthy while those of lesser means ""must depend on public servants.""
Accordingly, it would not be reasonable to conclude that highly paid lawyers face more professional obligations in taking on clients than lesser paid lawyers.  Rather, the opposite would be true: highly paid lawyers face fewer obligations in taking on clients because, unlike public servants, they are ""never required to represent a defendant."""
"114","What does the passage suggest about higher education for women in the nineteenth century?","B","21","There can be little doubt that Margaret Fuller embodied a new paradigm for women.  At a time when women were barred from higher education, she was arguably the best-read individual in New England and would become the first female public intellectual in the US. (Paragraph 1)
However, for Margaret—a child prodigy who was reading before the age of 4 and studying Latin under her father's stern but liberal-minded tutelage by 6—realizing her considerable potential would always come at a price….  From her earliest school days, Fuller's precocity provoked both awe and ridicule.  Later, when she demonstrated her irrepressible love of learning, she was accused of ""flaunting her erudition in gratuitous digressions.""  (Paragraph 2)
She taught at progressive New England schools before managing to support herself by leading discussion groups for women in Boston.  These seminars, or Socratic-style ""Conversations,"" were meant to supplement the paltry educational opportunities for women by allowing them to explore their intellectual interests and stimulating them to think in new ways. (Paragraph 3)
The passage states that ""women were barred from higher education"" (Paragraph 1) during the nineteenth century and emphasizes how even for Fuller, advanced learning or ""realizing her considerable potential would come at a price"" as from early on it ""provoked both awe and ridicule"" from others (Paragraph 2).  However, Paragraph 3 then details the ""seminars, or Socratic-style 'Conversations,'"" led by Fuller and intended ""to supplement the paltry (limited) educational opportunities for women by allowing them to explore their intellectual interests and stimulating them to think in new ways.""
This information strongly suggests that nineteenth-century women who were interested in higher learning could sometimes find alternatives to the formal education from which they were excluded.  Consequently, the passage implies that, in the nineteenth century, some women had alternative opportunities for higher education.
 (Choice A) Few women considered higher education advantageous.  Paragraph 3 conveys how Fuller ""manag[ed] to support herself by leading discussion groups for women in Boston.""  These groups were ""seminars, or Socratic-style 'Conversations'…meant to supplement the paltry educational opportunities for women"" by encouraging them ""to explore their intellectual interests and…think in new ways.""  Because Fuller was able to support herself through these seminars, it is likely they were popular.  Accordingly, the passage suggests that more than a few women in the nineteenth century considered having some sort of higher education advantageous.
(Choice C) Higher education garnered women greater respect.  According to Paragraph 2, ""[f]rom her earliest school days,"" Fuller's mature intellect ""provoked both awe and ridicule.""  Later, because of her impressive knowledge, she ""was accused of 'flaunting her erudition in gratuitous digressions.'""  Accordingly, Fuller's learning sometimes elicited harsh reactions.  Therefore, the example of the extremely learned Margaret Fuller suggests that having higher education would not necessarily garner a nineteenth-century woman greater respect; in fact, it might have caused her to be perceived negatively.
(Choice D) Higher education constituted a realistic option only for upper-class women.  Paragraph 1 states that ""women were barred from higher education"" in Fuller's time.  Paragraph 3 describes Fuller's own seminars as ""meant to supplement the paltry educational opportunities for women.""  Furthermore, the passage never mentions upper-class women nor suggests that the educational restrictions imposed on women allowed for exceptions.  Therefore, the passage never indicates that formal higher education was a realistic option only for upper-class women."
"115","If nineteenth-century society had embraced Fuller's ideas about gender, it would be reasonable to suppose that:","C","21","In Woman, Fuller not only sounded the clarion call of social equality for women but also advocated for the rights of all human beings, regardless of gender or race.  A synthesis of classical mythology and German Romanticism led her to believe that the ideal person was a felicitous integration of male and female elements that perpetually flowed into one another.  Thus, although Fuller bemoaned male dominance, she felt it was incumbent upon women to embrace an Emersonian self-reliance and develop their ""Minerva"" or rational, warrior side rather than merely play the traditional part of supporting muse.  Likewise, she urged men to cultivate their ""Apollo"" or intuitive side.  Indeed, Fuller insisted that the well-being of society hinged on replacing the radically polarized model of the sexes with a more balanced one. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, ""In Woman, Fuller…sounded the clarion call (ie, a clear summons to action) of social equality for women.""  Fuller believed that ""the ideal person was a felicitous (favorable) integration of male and female elements that perpetually flowed into one another.""  She ""bemoaned male dominance"" but also thought women ought ""to embrace an Emersonian self-reliance and develop their 'Minerva' or rational, warrior side.""  In particular, she thought that women should avoid ""merely play[ing] the traditional part of supporting muse.""  Furthermore, Fuller ""insisted that the well-being of society hinged on replacing the radically polarized model of the sexes with a more balanced one.""
Consequently, Fuller believed that women should become more independent and that the polarization of the sexes should be moderated accordingly.  Therefore, if nineteenth-century society had embraced Fuller's ideas about gender, it would be reasonable to suppose that, as females became more independent, women would have sought more autonomy within marriage.
 (Choices A and D) independent women would have more often be considered misfits; and many more women would have moved from nonconformist to traditional roles.  According to Paragraph 2, ""Although nonconformity, freedom, and self-development were the prevailing watchwords of Transcendentalism, Fuller was nevertheless stigmatized for exhibiting what some perceived to be 'the bravado (boldness) of a misfit' and many deemed 'an unwomanly arrogance.'""  However, in Fuller's view, ""the ideal person was a felicitous integration of male and female elements that perpetually flowed into one another"" (Paragraph 5).  Hence, Fuller encouraged women ""to embrace an Emersonian self-reliance and develop their 'Minerva' or rational, warrior side rather than merely play the traditional part of supporting muse.""
Accordingly, if nineteenth-century society had embraced Fuller's ideas about gender, independent women would not have been considered misfits.  Furthermore, it would be reasonable to suppose that instead of just filling traditional roles, many more women might have moved into roles that previously would have been considered nonconformist.
(Choice B) fewer men would have autonomy within marriage.  Paragraph 5 states that ""In Woman, Fuller not only sounded the clarion call of social equality for women but also advocated for the rights of all human beings, regardless of gender or race.""  Accordingly, although ""Fuller bemoaned male dominance,"" she believed that it is up to women themselves to become autonomous ""rather than merely play the traditional part of supporting muse.""  In Fuller's view, ""the well-being of society hinged on replacing the radically polarized model of the sexes with a more balanced one.""  Consequently, embracing Fuller's ideas about gender would not mean that the number of men having autonomy within marriage would decrease, but rather that the number of women having autonomy within marriage would increase."
"116","In the twentieth century, Swiss psychologist Carl Jung maintained that, to become well-balanced individuals, women must develop the masculine aspect in their psyche he called the animus, and men the feminine aspect or anima.  The parallels between Jung's ideas and Fuller's could be due to any of the following EXCEPT:","B","21","Having earned the admiration of the eminent Ralph Waldo Emerson, Fuller penetrated the inner circle of the highly influential but short-lived sociophilosophical movement known as Transcendentalism, where her talents found an outlet.  An integral part of both nineteenth-century social reforms and the literary renaissance that bred Hawthorne and Dickinson, Fuller became deeply woven into the fabric of American history. (Paragraph 1)
Her emancipatory tract Woman in the Nineteenth Century was an instant bestseller in 1845. (Paragraph 4)
…[S]he perished in a shipwreck off the New York coast on returning from Italy in 1850. (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 1, Fuller was ""[a]n integral part of both nineteenth-century social reforms and the literary renaissance"" of the time and would become ""deeply woven into the fabric of American history.""  Paragraph 4 notes that Fuller's treatise Woman in the Nineteenth Century ""was an instant bestseller in 1845,"" while Paragraph 6 conveys that Fuller ""perished in a shipwreck…in 1850.""
These dates situate Fuller firmly in the first half of the nineteenth century.  Because Carl Jung is described as maintaining his theories about gender in the twentieth century, his ideas could not have influenced Fuller's.  Therefore, the parallels between Jung's ideas and Fuller's could not have been due to Jung's impact on Fuller.
 (Choice A) Fuller's impact on Jung.  Paragraph 4 describes Fuller's Woman in the Nineteenth Century as ""an instant bestseller in 1845.""  Furthermore, as noted in Paragraph 1, Fuller was an active member of both ""the inner circle of the highly influential…sociophilosophical movement known as Transcendentalism"" and the ""literary renaissance"" in America, so her ideas could have been transmitted through transcendentalist texts.  Accordingly, Fuller's theories were well known prior to the twentieth century in which Jung was writing.  Therefore, the parallels between Jung's and Fuller's ideas about gender could have been due to Fuller's impact on Jung.
(Choices C and D) Fuller's impact on Transcendentalism; and Transcendentalism's impact on Jung.  According to Paragraph 1, Fuller won ""the admiration of the eminent Ralph Waldo Emerson"" and ""penetrated the inner circle of the highly influential but short-lived sociophilosophical movement known as Transcendentalism, where her talents found an outlet.""  Fuller is also described as ""[a]n integral part of…the literary renaissance.""  Later, as noted in Paragraph 3, ""Emerson made Fuller the inaugural (first) editor of the transcendentalist magazine The Dial.""  Thus, Fuller clearly contributed to the nineteenth-century phenomenon of Transcendentalism and its textual output.  Therefore, any similarity between Jung's and Fuller's ideas could have been due to Fuller's impact on Transcendentalism or to Transcendentalism's influence on Jung in the twentieth century."
"117","If the passage demonstrates that new paradigms for women in the nineteenth century broke down traditional barriers, then one can reasonably conclude that:","A","21","There can be little doubt that Margaret Fuller embodied a new paradigm for women.  At a time when women were barred from higher education, she was arguably the best-read individual in New England and would become the first female public intellectual in the US. (Paragraph 1)
She taught at progressive…schools before managing to support herself by leading discussion groups for women in Boston.  These seminars, or Socratic-style ""Conversations,"" were meant to supplement the paltry educational opportunities for women by allowing them to explore their intellectual interests and stimulating them to think in new ways.  In 1844, Emerson made Fuller the inaugural editor of the transcendentalist magazine The Dial.  Within 2 years, the caliber of her journalistic contributions spurred an invitation…to work for the New York Tribune as America's first full-time literary critic, and she went on to become the first-ever female foreign correspondent. (Paragraph 3)
Thus, although Fuller bemoaned male dominance, she felt it was incumbent upon women to embrace an Emersonian self-reliance and develop their ""Minerva"" or rational, warrior side rather than merely play the traditional part of supporting muse. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 1 states that Fuller ""embodied a new paradigm for women,"" describing her as ""the first female public intellectual in the US.""  Paragraph 3 conveys that Fuller led ""seminars, or Socratic-style 'Conversations'…meant to supplement the paltry (limited) educational opportunities for women by allowing them to explore their intellectual interests and stimulating them to think in new ways.""  Having served as editor of The Dial, Fuller also became ""America's first full-time literary critic"" and ""the first-ever female foreign correspondent.""
Furthermore, in her feminist tract Woman in the Nineteenth Century, Fuller encouraged women ""to embrace an Emersonian self-reliance and develop their 'Minerva' or rational, warrior side rather than merely play the traditional part of supporting muse"" (Paragraph 5).
Consequently, Fuller broke down gender barriers and opened up to women opportunities that had previously been available only to men.  Therefore, if the passage demonstrates that new paradigms for women in the nineteenth century broke down traditional barriers, one can reasonably conclude that, inherently, new paradigms for women challenge conventions and construct alternatives.
 (Choice B) people are more resistant to change the longer they stick with established norms.  It might be reasonable to assume that people tend to become more resistant to change the longer they stick with established norms.  However, the passage never makes any correlation between people's resistance to change and the duration of norms.  Furthermore, the existence of such a correlation is not tied to the passage demonstration that new paradigms for women in the nineteenth century broke down traditional barriers.
(Choice C) older gender paradigms need not be abandoned as long as other models are available.  In Fuller's view, women ought to ""develop their 'Minerva' or rational, warrior side rather than merely play the traditional part of supporting muse,"" and men ought to ""cultivate their 'Apollo' or intuitive side"" (Paragraph 5).  However, the passage never suggests that following the older gender paradigms would remain a valid option once newer paradigms are established.
(Choice D) new paradigms can take root only in historical contexts that are receptive.  Paragraph 1 states that Fuller ""embodied a new paradigm for women"" and highlights some of the barriers she broke down.  However, the passage also shows that Fuller initially met resistance and was ""stigmatized for exhibiting what some perceived to be 'the bravado (boldness) of a misfit' and many deemed 'an unwomanly arrogance'"" (Paragraph 2).  Later, however, Fuller's ""emancipatory (liberating) tract"" would become ""an instant bestseller"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, although the nineteenth-century historical context was initially unreceptive to new paradigms for women, those paradigms went on to take root.  Therefore, one cannot reasonably conclude that new paradigms can take root only in historical contexts that are receptive."
"118","Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and de Beauvoir's The Second Sex are cited by the author to support the idea that:","D","21","Yet Fuller is probably most celebrated by posterity for the role one biographer has described as ""feminist messiah.""  Her emancipatory tract Woman in the Nineteenth Century was an instant bestseller in 1845 and has since evoked favorable comparisons with perhaps the two greatest manifestos of women's liberation—Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, published a half-century earlier, and Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, published a century later.  Fuller's book also provided much of the impetus for the Seneca Falls women's convention in 1848. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, Fuller's ""emancipatory (liberating) tract Woman in the Nineteenth Century was an instant bestseller in 1845.""  Her work has also ""evoked favorable comparisons with perhaps the two greatest manifestos (public declarations of purpose) of women's liberation—Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, published a half-century earlier, and Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, published a century later.""  Based on this information, there was a 150-year span of time between the two landmark works on women's rights that came before and after Fuller's book.
Accordingly, Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and de Beauvoir's The Second Sex are cited in the passage to support the notion that Fuller's work was a pillar in a movement spanning at least 150 years.
 By contrast, Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman and de Beauvoir's The Second Sex are not cited in the passage to support any of the following notions:
until recently, it was generally thought that feminism pertained solely to women (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 5, ""In Woman, Fuller not only sounded the clarion call (ie, a clear summons to action) of social equality for women but also advocated for the rights of all human beings, regardless of gender or race.""  In Fuller's estimation, ""the ideal person was a felicitous (favorable) integration of male and female elements that perpetually flowed into one another.""  Hence, she believed that ""the well-being of society hinged on replacing the radically polarized model of the sexes with a more balanced one.""  Consequently, Fuller's theories show that the notion of feminist issues' affecting all members of society had already been proposed in the nineteenth century.
feminism was a phenomenon of the nineteenth century (Choice B).  As Paragraph 4 conveys, Fuller's Woman ""was an instant bestseller in 1845 and has since evoked favorable comparisons with…Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, published a half-century earlier, and Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, published a century later.""  This information indicates that feminism was an issue from at least 1795 to 1945 and therefore not strictly a phenomenon of the nineteenth century.
Fuller's Woman is the preeminent tract advocating for women's rights (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 4, Fuller's ""emancipatory tract Woman in the Nineteenth Century was an instant bestseller…and has since evoked favorable comparisons with perhaps the two greatest manifestos of women's liberation,"" those of Wollstonecraft and de Beauvoir.  This information suggests that Fuller's Woman, although important, cannot be considered superior to the other two feminist texts mentioned.  Consequently, Fuller's Woman cannot claim to be the preeminent (outstanding) text advocating for women's rights."
"119","Given the information in Paragraph 2, with which of the following assertions would the author be most likely to agree?","D","22","In each case, the term was decidedly negative, reflecting the popular portrayal of Thomas as both wrong and confrontational toward his fellows.  Unswayed by their testimony, Thomas declares his unbelief, challenging the faith of the other apostles and, by extension, the basis of Christianity.  'Unless my standards of evidence are met,' he seems boldly to say, 'I will never believe what you tell me.'  Thus Thomas becomes a symbol of stubborn refusal, a negative exemplar to contrast with the belief to which Christians are called.  But as useful as that depiction may appear to countless sermons about faith, it misunderstands the message of the scripture. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, there is a ""popular portrayal of Thomas as both wrong and confrontational toward his fellows.""  In this portrayal, Thomas is ""a symbol of stubborn refusal, a negative exemplar to contrast with the belief to which Christians are called.""  Hence, the author implies that Thomas is commonly seen as someone who wrongly and stubbornly refuses to believe.
However, the author disagrees with this view of Thomas, stating: ""as useful as that depiction may appear to countless sermons about faith, it misunderstands the message of the scripture.""  Accordingly, the author thinks a common Christian lesson about faith is based on misunderstanding the point of the scripture about Thomas.  Consequently, the author would most likely agree with the assertion that many Christians have drawn an erroneous inference from Thomas' story.
 (Choice A)  Christian faith should be viewed as relevant to environmental concerns.  Paragraph 1 states that ""the connotations (associated ideas) attached to these uses [of 'Doubting Thomas'] are largely unjustified.""  Paragraph 2 then provides two examples, including a case in which ""one Christian environmentalist recently rebuked 'Doubting Thomases' who dispute the relevance of religion to ecological justice.""  Accordingly, the author cites this example to illustrate the ""decidedly negative"" use of the term ""Doubting Thomas.""  However, he or she does not take a stance on the relationship between religion and ecological justice.  Therefore, the passage does not indicate whether the author would agree that Christian faith should be seen as relevant to environmental concerns.
(Choice B)  Skepticism has no place in the attitude of a religious believer.  Paragraph 2 mentions how ""a secular article on education criticized the skepticism that a 'Doubting Thomas' had displayed about a teaching method.""  However, the author never expresses an opinion about such skepticism.  Moreover, the author argues against the view that Thomas is a ""negative exemplar to contrast with the belief to which Christians are called,"" asserting that this portrayal of Thomas ""misunderstands the message of the scripture.""  Accordingly, the author implies that Thomas' skepticism has been unfairly criticized, which would suggest that skepticism can have a place in the attitude of a religious believer.
(Choice C)  Thomas' portrayal differs between religious and secular contexts.  According to Paragraph 2, ""one Christian environmentalist recently rebuked 'Doubting Thomases' who dispute the relevance of religion to ecological justice; likewise, a secular (non-religious) article on education criticized the skepticism that a 'Doubting Thomas' had displayed about a teaching method.  In each case, the term was decidedly negative.""  Therefore, the author suggests that Thomas' portrayal is similar in both religious and secular contexts."
"120","The author's assertion that Thomas was not unique in doubting Christ's resurrection (Paragraph 3) is used as evidence for which of the following passage claims?","A","22","The most important point to recognize in this regard is that Thomas does not ask for anything beyond what the other apostles have already received.  They have seen Christ while he has not, having experienced the physical confirmation that Thomas still lacks.  Hence, Thomas is not unique in wanting proof—or, if he is, then his uniqueness is a matter of chance.  We might well have had ""Doubting Peter"" or ""Doubting Bartholomew,"" if either of them had been absent instead.  With this observation in mind, Thomas' words are cast in a new light: ""Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.""  Typically, words in scriptures are not italicized to indicate inflection in this way, but those emphases clearly reflect the intended meaning.  Thomas' remark is far from the defiant challenge to faith it has so often been viewed as.  Instead, it is the mournful, perhaps desperate admission of one who wants to believe but is afraid to hope. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, ""Thomas does not ask for anything beyond what the other apostles have already received.  They have seen Christ while he has not.""  Thus, the author implies that Thomas does not display a greater level of doubt than the other apostles.  Their belief was also based on actually seeing Christ, so ""Thomas is not unique in wanting proof—or, if he is, then his uniqueness is a matter of chance.""
Paragraph 3 then states: ""With this observation in mind, Thomas' words are cast in a new light: 'Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.'""  The author argues that ""those emphases clearly reflect the intended meaning"" of that statement, which shows that Thomas' remark ""is far from the defiant challenge to faith it has so often been viewed as.""  In other words, recognizing that Thomas is not unique in doubting Christ's resurrection affects how his statement of doubt should be interpreted.
Therefore, the author's assertion that Thomas was not unique in doubting Christ's resurrection is used as evidence for the passage claim that correctly interpreting Thomas' declaration of doubt depends on properly emphasizing the way the words in the scripture were probably spoken.
 By contrast, that assertion is not used as evidence for the following passage claims:
The term ""Doubting Thomas"" has expanded beyond its origins to be used in contexts that have little to do with religion(Choice B).  Paragraph 1 states that ""the description 'Doubting Thomas'…has entered the general lexicon and is used in both religious and non-religious contexts.""  However, the author never suggests that this usage is based on the idea that Thomas is not unique in doubting; rather, the use of the term implies that Thomas is being singled out.
Thomas' declaration of doubt has traditionally led to his portrayal as a symbol of stubborn refusal of faith(Choice C).  Paragraph 2 describes ""the popular portrayal of Thomas"" in which he ""declares his unbelief, challenging the faith of the other apostles.""  Accordingly, the idea that ""Thomas becomes a symbol of stubborn refusal"" is based on a perception that he displays doubt in a way that the other apostles do not.  Therefore, the claim that Thomas is not unique in doubting is meant to counter that traditional portrayal; it does not provide evidence to explain how that portrayal became prevalent.
Thomas' declaration of doubt distinguishes him from other believers, who would have faith in the resurrection while lacking the confirmation of sight(Choice D).  According to Paragraph 4, ""Christ… distinguishes between them [Thomas and the other apostles] collectively and anyone who only hears that Christ has risen.""  Therefore, the distinction between Thomas and other such believers depends only on whether their beliefs are based on seeing Christ.  Such a distinction does not depend on whether Thomas was unique in doubting Christ's resurrection."
"121","For which of the following passage claims does the author provide the most supporting evidence?","A","22","The story of so-called ""Doubting Thomas"" is generally familiar to Christians: after the resurrection Christ appears to his followers, but Thomas is absent from the group at the time.  When the other apostles tell him that Christ has risen from the dead, Thomas replies: ""Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe"" (John 20:25, NRSV)….  Hence, the description ""Doubting Thomas"" now refers to a person who refuses to accept a claim unless proof is supplied.  Like other biblically inspired terms such as ""Good Samaritan"" and ""Prodigal Son,"" it has entered the general lexicon and is used in both religious and nonreligious contexts.  However, the connotations attached to these uses are largely unjustified. (Paragraph 1)
In each case, the term was decidedly negative, reflecting the popular portrayal of Thomas as both wrong and confrontational toward his fellows.  Unswayed by their testimony, Thomas declares his unbelief, challenging the faith of the other apostles and, by extension, the basis of Christianity. (Paragraph 2)
The most important point to recognize in this regard is that Thomas does not ask for anything beyond what the other apostles have already received.  They have seen Christ while he has not, having experienced the physical confirmation that Thomas still lacks.  Hence, Thomas is not unique in wanting proof—or, if he is, then his uniqueness is a matter of chance.  We might well have had ""Doubting Peter"" or ""Doubting Bartholomew,"" if either of them had been absent instead. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 1 describes the biblical ""story of so-called 'Doubting Thomas,'"" in which ""after the resurrection Christ appears to his followers, but Thomas is absent from the group at the time.""  Because Thomas has not seen Christ for himself, he does not believe the other apostles when they tell him that Christ has risen: ""'Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.""  As a result of this narrative, ""the description 'Doubting Thomas' now refers to a person who refuses to accept a claim unless proof is supplied.""
However, a central theme of the passage is that ""the connotations (associated ideas) attached to [the term 'Doubting Thomas'] are largely unjustified"" (Paragraph 1).  The author asserts that ""the popular portrayal of Thomas as both wrong and confrontational toward his fellows…misunderstands the message of the scripture"" (Paragraph 2).
Paragraph 3 then directly argues that Thomas did not display any more doubt than the other apostles: ""Thomas does not ask for anything beyond what the other apostles have already received.  They have seen Christ while he has not, having experienced the physical confirmation that Thomas still lacks.""  Accordingly, the author concludes that the other apostles would likely have acted the same way: ""We might well have had 'Doubting Peter' or 'Doubting Bartholomew,' if one of them had been absent instead.""
Consequently, the author provides the most evidence to support the claim that the term ""Doubting Thomas"" could easily have been ""Doubting Peter"" or ""Doubting Bartholomew"" instead.  This claim is a conclusion which follows from ideas that the author develops throughout the passage.
 (Choice B)  In most cases, biblical scriptures do not include text that has been italicized to indicate a speaker's voice inflection.  According to Paragraph 3, ""Typically, words in scriptures are not italicized to indicate inflection (vocal emphasis) in this way.""  However, the author does not provide evidence for this claim (for instance, by citing religious scholars or comparing various biblical translations).
(Choice C)  The term ""Doubting Thomas"" is similar to terms like ""Good Samaritan"" and ""Prodigal Son"" in having entered the general lexicon.  Paragraph 2 describes how ""a secular (non-religious) article on education criticized the skepticism that a 'Doubting Thomas' had displayed about a teaching method.""  Thus, the passage provides an example where the term ""Doubting Thomas"" is used.  However, the passage does not provide examples of the terms ""Good Samaritan"" or ""Prodigal Son"" to show that they too have entered common usage.
(Choice D)  Thomas' portrayal as a symbol of stubborn refusal has been part of countless sermons about faith.  According to Paragraph 2, in his popular portrayal ""Thomas becomes a symbol of stubborn refusal….  But as useful as that depiction may appear to countless sermons about faith, it misunderstands the message of the scripture.""  However, the author provides no examples of such sermons.  Rather, he or she seems to take their existence for granted in the context of the passage, which is dedicated to arguing that this portrayal of Thomas is unjustified."
"122","Which of the following people acts most similarly to Thomas, as he is described in the passage?","B","22","When the other apostles tell him that Christ has risen from the dead, Thomas replies: ""Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe"" (John 20:25, NRSV).  The following week, Thomas is present when the apostles meet, and Christ again appears.  Thomas then proclaims his belief, to which Christ replies: ""Have you believed because you have seen me?  Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe"" (John 20:29, NRSV). (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, ""When the other apostles tell him that Christ has risen from the dead, Thomas replies: 'Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.'""  Thus, Thomas is unwilling to believe the claim about Christ's resurrection based only on other people's testimony.  However, ""[t]he following week, Thomas is present when the apostles meet, and Christ again appears.  Thomas then proclaims his belief.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that Thomas is willing to accept the claim only when he has confirmed it for himself.
Consequently, a journalist who refuses to broadcast a story until he has confirmed its veracity acts most similarly to Thomas, as he is described in the passage.  Like Thomas, the journalist does not accept the story when it is originally presented but insists on verifying it for himself.
 By contrast, none of the following people insist on verifying a claim for themselves:
A scientist refuses to accept a research finding until it is subjected to additional peer review(Choice A).  Although the scientist would be demanding additional evidence before accepting the finding, the description does not specify that the peer review would be conducted by that scientist.  Accordingly, this situation lacks the key feature of Thomas' story.
A politician refuses to endorse legislation despite knowing the public supports it(Choice C).  Paragraph 2 describes Thomas' refusal to believe as ""challenging the faith of the other apostles and, by extension, the basis of Christianity.""  Hence, Thomas could be seen as refusing to endorse something that others support.  However, the key feature of his story involves personally verifying what he has been told, a feature which is not reflected in a politician refusing to pass popular legislation.
A lawyer refuses to represent a client until additional evidence of his innocence is discovered(Choice D).  This description does not specify that the lawyer discovers the evidence for himself or herself.  Therefore, it does not reflect the key feature of Thomas' story."
"123","Which of the following statements, if true, would most challenge the author's argument about the ""Doubting Thomas"" story?","A","22","In each case, the term was decidedly negative, reflecting the popular portrayal of Thomas as both wrong and confrontational toward his fellows.  Unswayed by their testimony, Thomas declares his unbelief, challenging the faith of the other apostles and, by extension, the basis of Christianity….  But as useful as that depiction may appear to countless sermons about faith, it misunderstands the message of the scripture. (Paragraph 2)
The most important point to recognize in this regard is that Thomas does not ask for anything beyond what the other apostles have already received.  They have seen Christ while he has not, having experienced the physical confirmation that Thomas still lacks.  Hence, Thomas is not unique in wanting proof—or, if he is, then his uniqueness is a matter of chance.  We might well have had ""Doubting Peter"" or ""Doubting Bartholomew,"" if one of them had been absent instead.  With this observation in mind, Thomas' words are cast in a new light. (Paragraph 3)
This interpretation also informs how Christ's response to Thomas should be understood.  By referring to ""those who have not seen,"" Christ does not distinguish between Thomas and the other apostles, all of whom believe because they have seen.  He distinguishes between them collectively and anyone who only hears that Christ has risen. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 2 describes ""the popular portrayal of Thomas as both wrong and confrontational toward his fellows,"" in which he ""declares his unbelief, challenging the faith of the other apostles.""  The author argues that this portrayal is flawed, asserting that ""it misunderstands the message of the scripture.""
The author supports that position in Paragraph 3 by stressing the similarity between Thomas and the other apostles: ""Thomas does not ask for anything beyond what the other apostles have already received.  They have seen Christ while he has not….  Hence, Thomas is not unique in wanting proof—or, if he is, then his uniqueness is a matter of chance.""  Accordingly, the author points out that the other apostles would likely have behaved the same way in Thomas' circumstances: ""We might well have had 'Doubting Peter' or 'Doubting Bartholomew,' if one of them had been absent instead.""
Therefore, the author argues that the traditional view of Thomas is mistaken because it erroneously treats him as different from the other apostles.  Consequently, the author's argument would be seriously challenged if most depictions of Thomas have focused on his similarity to Christ's other followers.  If that statement were true, it would undermine the central reason why the author thinks most depictions of Thomas misunderstand the point of his story.
 By contrast, none of the following statements would challenge the author's argument:
The term ""Doubting Thomas"" does not actually appear in the Bible (Choice B).  Paragraph 1 compares the term ""Doubting Thomas"" to ""other biblically inspired terms such as 'Good Samaritan' and 'Prodigal Son.'""  However, although the author calls these terms ""biblically inspired,"" he or she never claims that they actually appear in the Bible.  Moreover, the author's interpretation of Thomas' story does not depend on whether the term ""Doubting Thomas"" appears in the Bible or is only inspired by it.
None of Christ's other followers have come to be known for their doubt as Thomas has (Choice C).  Paragraph 3 states that ""Thomas is not unique in wanting proof—or, if he is, then his uniqueness is a matter of chance.  We might well have had 'Doubting Peter' or 'Doubting Bartholomew,' if one of them had been absent instead.""  Therefore, the author's argument includes the idea that none of Christ's other followers have come to be known for their doubt.
Most non-Christians are unfamiliar with the story behind the term ""Doubting Thomas"" (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 1, ""the story of so-called 'Doubting Thomas' is generally familiar to Christians.""  However, although the author states that the term ""has entered the general lexicon and is used in…non-religious contexts,"" he or she never claims that non-Christians are also familiar with the story from which it originates."
"124","Which of the following statements can be considered the central thesis of the passage?","D","23","Rhetorical questions with an end purpose can be propositioned with the intention of challenging curricular stratagem, particularly in the name of educational progress.  ""Should we teach literature in our college classrooms?"" or ""Do we have an ethical obligation to teach humanities to the next generation of scholars?"" (Paragraph 1)
So why study literature?  First, research has shown that studying the likes of Shakespeare, Wordsworth, and Dickens can generate feelings of human connectedness, an essential component for fulfilled living, social stimulation, and a long and healthy existence. (Paragraph 2)
Lastly, there is much to be gained from pedagogical models of studying literature:... (Paragraph 5)
Without literary study to instill in us the value of the human experience, we may willingly sacrifice more than just coursework:  we may be on the verge of surrendering our human spirit. (Paragraph 6)
The central thesis of a passage can be inferred by identifying a series of supporting arguments that build on one another as a reader progresses through the text.  In this case, the passage makes multiple arguments in Paragraphs 1, 2, 5, and 6 to support the idea that studying literature in higher education is priceless.  First, the author claims in Paragraph 1 that in order for education to progress, rhetorical questions must be asked (eg, ""Should we teach literature in our college classrooms?"").
As another example, Paragraph 5 states, ""Lastly, there is much to be gained from pedagogical models of studying literature.""  Finally, in Paragraph 6, the following assertion is made: ""Without literary study to instill in us the value of the human experience, we may willingly sacrifice more than just coursework:  we may be on the verge of surrendering our human spirit.""  As a result, it can be concluded that the central thesis of the passage is that the study of literature in higher education is indispensable.
(Choice A)  According to Paragraph 1, rhetorical questions are important to ask in educational circles.  However, this idea of using rhetorical questions was proposed only as an introductory sentence, not as the central thesis, and is accordingly not well supported in the remainder of the passage.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 4 discusses the ""joy"" and other emotions that reading literature invokes, but this discussion appears in this paragraph only, indicating that it is not the central thesis of the passage.
(Choice C)  Although Paragraph 2 iterates that ""human beings need social stimuli to live long healthy lives,"" this is neither pervasive nor supported throughout the passage and is therefore not the central thesis.  For instance, Paragraph 3 introduces the new idea that humans can find value in remembering our literary past, which is a separate concept from human connectedness."
"125","For which of these passage assertions does the author provide the LEAST evidence?","C","23","[C]ultural studies intrinsically teaches less ethnocentrism and more tolerance, and the reader-response theory teaches that each individual response has value based on unique human experiences, to name a few. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 mentions in passing that ""cultural studies intrinsically teaches less ethnocentrism and more tolerance,"" but it does not elaborate on the terms ""less ethnocentrism and more tolerance.""  Instead, the passage introduces a new concept: the reader-response theory.  Because this is the only option with no direct support or examples, it can be considered to have the least evidence provided.
(Choice A)  According to Paragraph 2, ""it can be surmised that 'deep readers' may have a superior ability to understand and empathize socially by viewing the world through the differing perspectives of others, enhancing the potential for human connectivity.""  Given this textual support, this option does not represent the choice with the least evidence.
(Choice B)  The quotation from The Mill on the Floss, Paragraph 4, gives a specific example to support the claim that ""the written text is prized due to its ability to incite…a myriad of emotions that make us inherently human.""
(Choice D)  According to Paragraph 3, it is important to remember our literary past in ""its truest form"" (ie, ""the written word"" rather than ""technological presentations"").  In addition, this claim is supported by the statement that ""the writings hold the intended 'environmental literary print' up to the light, allowing readers to gain a valuable snapshot of history that cannot be replaced."""
"126","In the context of the passage, it can be assumed that the term ""pedagogical models"" is introduced to show:","B","23","Lastly, there is much to be gained from pedagogical models of studying literature:  women's studies teaches the value of gender equality, cultural studies intrinsically teaches less ethnocentrism and more tolerance, and the reader-response theory teaches that each individual response has value based on unique human experiences, to name a few. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 outlines three ""pedagogical models"" of studying literature:  women's studies (which teaches gender equality values), cultural studies (which teaches less ethnocentrism and more tolerance), and the reader-response theory (which states that individual responses have value based on human experiences).  Each model and its teachings are introduced to show the existence of valuable methods that can be used to teach literature.
(Choice A)  The ""pedagogical models"" are presented in the context of literary teaching methods.  There is no connection to art or an explanation of how art interacts with other disciplines.
(Choice C)  Women's studies, cultural studies, and the reader-response theory are not introduced to warn of the consequences of not accounting for human learning capabilities.  Instead, these ""models"" were defined to mention the many ways in which humans can study and learn useful lessons from literature.
(Choice D)  The three literary ideologies discussed in Paragraph 5, although valuable, are not dependent on one another for meaning.  There is no mention of a relationship among the three; rather, they are listed as examples, as indicated by ""to name a few."""
"127","Which of the following statements, if true, would most directly challenge the author's claims regarding the literary past?","C","23","[I]t may be beneficial to remember our literary past in its truest form, the written word, over the superfluity of technological presentations of ancient texts.  For instance, Shakespeare's body of work has been reduced to two-minute self-produced video clips found on the Internet, a valuable teaching tool for younger students with ever-shortening attention spans but one that lamentably excludes the essential beauty of the original prose. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 explains the benefits of remembering the literary past and hints that technology is a hindrance: ""Shakespeare's body of work has been reduced to two-minute…video clips,"" which ""lamentably excludes the essential beauty of the original prose.""  Therefore, if technological advances were to lead to an increase in students' interest in literary history, this would challenge the author's assertion that our literary past can be best studied and remembered in its truest form:  ""the written word.""
(Choice A)  If Shakespearean prose were described to be ""more beautiful"" than modern English, this would strengthen (not challenge) the author's assertion that modern video clips on Shakespeare's work are a teaching tool that ""lamentably excludes the essential beauty of the original prose.""
(Choice B)  Paragraph 3 states that ""it may be beneficial to recall our literary past in its truest form, the written word, over the superfluity of technological representations of ancient texts.""  An overabundance of video clips on ancient literature compared to written books would not challenge the author's claim that the written word, rather than technology, is the ""truest form"" of the literary past.
(Choice D)  The author claims that short teaching videos are useful for younger students with ""ever-shortening attention spans.""  However, if an even further reduction in the attention span of younger students were revealed, it would be impossible to determine if this were due to students' watching more video clips about literature."
"128","Based on the content of the passage, the author would most likely advocate for which type of college class?
A lecture-based course that requires students to visit a local museum monthly
A text-based course in which students read a classic literary piece weekly
A cross-discipline course in which students adapt book summaries into theatrical pieces","B","23","[I]t may be beneficial to remember our literary past in its truest form, the written word, over the superfluity of technological presentations of ancient texts. (Paragraph 3)
[W]e could move from an extrinsic value of literature to an intrinsic one; that is, the written text is valuable in its capability to produce…a myriad of emotions that make us inherently human. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 3 iterates that humans should ""remember our literary past in its truest form, the written word,"" and Paragraph 4 elaborates on the values of the ""written text.""  The author is a proponent of studying literature in the form of its original writing and would therefore be most likely to advocate for a text-based course that relies on the reading of classic literary pieces weekly (Number II).
(Number I)  A lecture-based class that requires students to visit a local museum focuses on lecturing and providing students with a hands-on experience rather than reading the actual literary text.  There is no evidence in the passage that the author would advocate this type of class.
(Number III)  A cross-discipline course in which students adapt book summaries into theatrical pieces does not use the original written text, as the author favors.  Book summaries are simply brief outlines of a much longer original text; therefore, the students would not be using the original book but adapting another version (summary) into a theatrical performance.  Such a course would not focus on the original literary text."
"129","Why does the author quote the following from George Eliot's novel:  ""We can never give up longing and wishing while we are thoroughly alive.  There are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good, and we must hunger after them"" (Paragraph 4)?","B","23","Third, if we could measure the amount of joy that comes from discovering a forgotten text lying on the shelf, we could move from an extrinsic value of literature to an intrinsic one; that is, the written text is valuable in its capability to produce felicitousness, laughter, woefulness, and a myriad of emotions that make us inherently human.  As George Eliot writes in the canonical The Mill on the Floss, ""We can never give up longing and wishing while we are thoroughly alive.  There are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good, and we must hunger after them.""  This exemplifies the human condition that strives toward fulfillment at our core psyche; a sentiment perhaps best expressed in the written language itself. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 begins by discussing the emotions that make us ""inherently human"" and that can be elicited reading literature (eg, joy, laughter, woefulness).  The author then quotes Eliot's belief that humans should ""never give up longing and wishing while we are thoroughly alive,"" as there are ""certain things"" that are ""beautiful and good"" and must be hungered after.
This statement is followed by the claim that such a desire ""exemplifies the human condition that strives toward fulfillment at our core psyche, a sentiment perhaps best expressed in the written language itself.""  Based on the text, it can therefore be assumed that Eliot is quoted to illustrate the point that literature is essential in the search for overall life satisfaction (fulfillment).
(Choice A)  Before quoting Eliot, the first sentence of Paragraph 4 already provides three examples of emotions that can be evoked by reading literature:  ""felicitousness, laughter, [and] woefulness.""  However, the Eliot quote is a more generic statement about human longing and is therefore not a specific example of sentiments elicited by the explicit reading of literature.
(Choice C)  The passage mentions that if the joy felt from finding a forgotten text could be measured, then one could shift from the extrinsic to intrinsic value of literature (ie, that reading can elicit emotions).  Eliot is quoted to further support the intrinsic, not extrinsic, value of studying literature.  In addition, although the author describes the intrinsic value of studying literature, no definition is given regarding its extrinsic value.
(Choice D)  The earlier point made about human connectedness being essential for longevity (Paragraph 2) is separate from the Eliot quote in Paragraph 4.  The Eliot quote stresses the longing for ""beautiful and good"" things, not that the need for human connectedness is essential for long life."
"130","The author suggests that Freud would most likely have considered which of the following the best reason to apply his interpretive methods to literature?","B","24","But how to uncover the deeper meaning of this theme with a thousand variations?  From a Freudian perspective, a literary scene is like a dream, a production of the human psyche arising from the unconscious.  As with dreams, the true meaning is to be found beneath the surface (in what Freud calls the latent content in contrast to the manifest content).  Accordingly, the most effective tools for parsing the pair of Shakespearean scenes are the psychoanalytic methods of dream interpretation. (Paragraph 3)
Freud posits that in producing literary motifs, as in the creation of dreams, the psyche imposes its censorship to disguise elements it deems unacceptable, often inverting them: hence, fate becomes freedom, and the third woman is no longer a goddess of death but of life-affirming love.  The scenes thus compensate for the reality of death; they express a wish to escape mortality by opting for love's vitality. (Paragraph 4)
In Paragraph 3, the author conveys Freud's belief that ""a literary scene is like a dream, a production of the human psyche arising from the unconscious.  As with dreams, the true meaning is to be found beneath the surface (in what Freud calls the latent content in contrast to the manifest content).""  Accordingly, Freudian dream interpretation methods are the ""most effective tools"" for analyzing literature as they can ""uncover the deeper meaning"" of literary scenes.
Paragraph 4 elaborates on the idea that these interpretive methods can expose deeper meanings: ""Freud posits that in producing literary motifs, as in the creation of dreams, the psyche imposes its censorship to disguise elements it deems unacceptable, often inverting them.""  Freud's dream interpretation methods reveal these disguised and inverted elements, indicating their deeper significance.  For example, in the motif of three choices, freedom of choice is an inversion of fate while the goddess of ""life-affirming love"" is an inversion of the death goddess.
Consequently, the author suggests that in Freud's view the best reason to apply his interpretive methods to literary scenes is that they expose the deeper significance of a scene's elements.
 By contrast, the author does not suggest that Freud would have considered any of the following the best reason to apply his interpretive methods to literature:
They demonstrate the similarities between psychology and literature (Choice A).  Paragraph 3 describes Freud's belief that ""a literary scene is like a dream, a production of the human psyche arising from the unconscious.""  As Paragraph 5 emphasizes, Freud believed that psychology and literature were so analogous, ""great literary works"" could be seen as ""illustrating the laws of psychical functioning.""  However, in applying his interpretive methods to literature, Freud's aim was not to demonstrate literature's similarities to psychology but, as with dreams, to apply ""the most effective tools"" that would be able to ""uncover the deeper meaning"" of a literary work (Paragraph 3).
They lessen the impact of unacceptable elements in the scenes (Choice C).  According to Freudian theory, ""in producing literary motifs, as in the creation of dreams, the psyche imposes its censorship to disguise elements it deems unacceptable, often inverting them"" (Paragraph 4).  Freud's dream interpretation methods thus expose elements from which the psyche tries to protect itself.  For example, the prized third woman is shown to represent the goddess of death.  In revealing these original, unacceptable elements, it is likely that Freud's methods would increase rather than lessen the impact of those elements on the reader.
They operate according to a rule of substituting opposites (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 4, Freud believed that ""in producing literary motifs…the psyche imposes its censorship to disguise elements it deems unacceptable, often inverting them.""  For example, ""fate becomes freedom.""  Thus, by exposing these substitutions of opposites, Freud's interpretative methods give access to the scene's deeper meaning.  However, this operative rule is only an aspect of applying Freud's methods, not a reason for applying them."
"131","The author's claim that Shakespeare's works helped shape the development of psychoanalysis depends on which of the following assertions?","C","24","In general, Freud believed that great literary works not only lend themselves to psychoanalytical interpretation but, in illustrating the laws of psychical functioning so well, also offer a resource for understanding psychology.  In particular, as Norman Holland notes, the Viennese psychoanalyst looked to the British bard to confirm and refine his theories: ""Freud's method was to take a pattern of mental life…and hold it up, as it were, against the play to discover a congruous pattern.""  Thus, Shakespearean themes contributed to the development of psychoanalytical methods, and Freud's ""little problem"" carried big implications. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, Freud thought that ""great literary works not only lend themselves to interpretation by the principles of psychoanalysis but, in illustrating the laws of psychical functioning so well, also offer a resource for understanding psychology.""  The author further conveys Holland's observation that Freud used Shakespeare's works in particular ""to confirm and refine his theories""; more specifically, ""'Freud's method was to take a pattern of mental life…and hold it up…against the play to discover a congruous (similar) pattern.'""  He or she then concludes that ""Shakespearean themes contributed to the development of psychoanalytical methods.""
This information indicates that Freud used Shakespearean works as a standard by which he could test or evaluate his own psychological theories.  Accordingly, the author's claim that Shakespeare's works helped shape the development of psychoanalysis depends on the assertion that Freud thought literature could be used to evaluate psychological ideas.
 (Choices A and B)  Literature and mythology works are enriched through dream interpretation; and Freud's dream interpretation changed how literature could be viewed.  The author relays Holland's observation that Freud looked to Shakespeare ""to confirm and refine his theories"" (Paragraph 5).  He or she then concludes that ""Shakespearean themes contributed to the development of psychoanalytical methods.""  However, the assertions that literary and mythological works are enriched through Freudian dream analysis and that Freud's dream interpretation changed how literature could be viewed do not describe Shakespeare's (or literature's) influence on Freudian theory but rather Freudian theory's influence on literature.  Consequently, the author's claim that Shakespeare's works helped shape the development of psychoanalysis does not depend on either of these assertions.
(Choice D)  Shakespeare was the first person to truly grasp the nuances of the human psyche.  According to Paragraph 5, Freud believed that great literary works like those of Shakespeare ""not only lend themselves to psychoanalytical interpretation but, in illustrating the laws of psychical functioning so well, also offer a resource for understanding psychology.""  The author further marshals Holland's observation that Freud turned to Shakespearean literature ""to confirm and refine his theories.""  However, the passage never implies that Shakespeare was the first individual to truly understand the subtleties of the human psyche."
"132","The author's use of the term ""as if by sleight of hand"" (Paragraph 2) implies that Freud's interpretive approach:","D","24","Freud conjectures that the well-known scenes represent variations on a more common literary motif in which a maiden chooses between three suitors.  Making some unexpected substitutions, as if by sleight of hand, he then unveils the hidden parallels: a male suitor now chooses among three caskets symbolizing three marriageable women, and these characters find rough counterparts in the elderly king with three daughters.  In both plays, the last and least assuming of the three choices constitutes the correct one. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, Freud believes that the two scenes from Shakespeare ""represent variations on a more common literary motif in which a maiden chooses between three suitors.""  The author further conveys how, by ""[m]aking some unexpected substitutions, as if by sleight of hand, [Freud] then unveils the hidden parallels"" between the scenes and the common literary motif.  For example, ""a male suitor now chooses among three caskets symbolizing three marriageable women, and these characters find rough counterparts in the elderly king with three daughters.""
The passage thus describes Freud as making unexpected or surprising connections between seemingly disparate (different) elements of the two scenes and compares his interpretive maneuver to a sleight-of-hand or magic trick.  Consequently, the author's use of the term ""as if by sleight of hand"" (Paragraph 2) implies that Freud's interpretive approach makes surprising connections between story elements that seem disparate.
 By contrast, the use of the term ""as if by sleight of hand"" does not imply that Freud's interpretive approach:
is only a trick that is meant to fool naïve individuals (Choice A).  The author uses the term ""as if by sleight of hand"" in Paragraph 2 to describe how Freud makes ""unexpected substitutions"" and so reveals ""the hidden parallels"" between the different versions of the motif.  In addition, Paragraph 3 relays Freud's genuine belief that ""a literary scene is like a dream, a production of the human psyche arising from the unconscious"" and that ""the most effective tools"" for analyzing such scenes are ""the psychoanalytic methods of dream interpretation.""  The passage never suggests that Freud's intention in applying his interpretive methods was to fool naïve individuals.
is limited in its ability to elucidate a literary work (Choice B).  The use of the term ""as if by sleight of hand"" in Paragraph 2 underscores Freud's ""unexpected substitutions"" that reveal ""the hidden parallels"" between the Shakespearean scenes and the more common literary motif.  Consequently, the author's use of the term does not imply that Freud's approach is limited but that it is expansive in enabling him to make surprising connections that help to elucidate (ie, shed new light on) a literary work.
obscures the original meaning of a particular motif's elements (Choice C).  According to the author, in ""[m]aking some unexpected substitutions"" of elements in the basic motif ""as if by sleight of hand, [Freud]…unveils the hidden parallels"" in its various versions.  For instance, Freud identifies the ""three marriageable women"" as ultimately representing the three Fates (Paragraph 2).  Therefore, by exposing such parallels, the author's use of the term ""as if by sleight of hand,"" which emphasizes Freud's ""unexpected substitutions,"" implies that his psychoanalytic approach reveals the original, mythical meanings of a motif's elements rather than obscuring them."
"133","The passage suggests that, in Freudian dream interpretation, when one entity is substituted for another, the two entities typically:","C","24","But can dream theory explain the evolution from a mythology of fate to tales of free choice?  How are the likes of Portia, Cordelia, or Cinderella potential surrogates for a death deity?  After all, given a choice of three women, who would wittingly pick the agent of death?  Freud posits that in producing literary motifs, as in the creation of dreams, the psyche imposes its censorship to disguise elements it deems unacceptable, often inverting them: hence, fate becomes freedom, and the third woman is no longer a goddess of death but of life-affirming love.  The scenes thus compensate for the reality of death; they express a wish to escape mortality by opting for love's vitality. (Paragraph 4)
Freud theorized that in both literary motifs and dreams, ""the psyche imposes its censorship to disguise elements it deems unacceptable, often inverting them"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, in analyzing the literary motifs, Freud claims that through inversion ""fate becomes freedom, and the third woman is no longer a goddess of death but of life-affirming love.""  Thus, when an element in a motif is inverted, it is transformed into its virtual opposite so it can substitute for the unacceptable element in a thoroughly disguised form.
Consequently, the passage suggests that, in Freudian dream interpretation, when one entity is substituted for another, the two entities typically seem to be virtual opposites of each other.
 (Choices A and D)  seem different in some aspects but alike in others; and are more alike than unalike.  According to Freudian theory, in both literary motifs and dreams, ""the psyche imposes its censorship to disguise elements it deems unacceptable, often inverting them"" (Paragraph 4).  Inverting an element transforms it into its virtual opposite; for example, in the motif of three choices, fate is replaced by freedom.  Because the entity and its resulting substitute are opposite in nature, they seem different in virtually all, not just some, respects; therefore, they are typically more unalike than alike.
(Choice B)  are superficially rather than substantively different.  Paragraph 4 relays the Freudian principle that in producing dreams and literature, ""the psyche imposes its censorship to disguise elements it deems unacceptable, often inverting them.""  For example, in the various versions of the motif of three choices, ""the third woman is no longer the goddess of death but of life-affirming love.""  Accordingly, the element and its inversion typically seem to be virtual opposites of each other, indicating that they are substantively (significantly) rather than superficially different."
"134","Based on Freud's interpretation, the motif of the three choices includes the idea that:
the third option is the humblest but the most ideal.
the third option reflects the unconscious wish to avoid death.
literary scenes represent variations on an older pattern.","D","24","In both plays, the last and least assuming of the three choices constitutes the correct one: it is the lead casket, not those of gold or silver, that delivers the prize of Portia, and, unlike the older sisters' effusive flattery, Cordelia's more measured declaration conveys authentic love for her father.  Freud then casts his net of comparison more broadly, discerning permutations of the pattern in other tales.  For example, Cinderella, the youngest and humblest but most beautiful of three sisters, becomes the prince's bride.  Finally, Freud identifies the three Fates as the primordial mythic feminine constellation, the third of whom represents death itself. (Paragraph 2)
After all, given a choice of three women, who would wittingly pick the agent of death?  Freud posits that in producing literary motifs, as in the creation of dreams, the psyche imposes its censorship to disguise elements it deems unacceptable, often inverting them: hence, fate becomes freedom, and the third woman is no longer a goddess of death but of life-affirming love.  The scenes thus compensate for the reality of death; they express a wish to escape mortality by opting for love's vitality. (Paragraph 4)
The passage indicates that in the Shakespearean scenes as well as in tales that feature a similar pattern, such as Cinderella, the third option is the humblest; it also turns out to be the correct choice or most ideal option.  Paragraph 2 specifically conveys that:
the lead casket, which represents the third (and humblest) option after gold and silver, ""delivers the prize of Portia"" (ie, with this choice Bassanio wins Portia as his bride);
""Cordelia's more measured (ie, more restrained or humbler) declaration conveys authentic love for her father (King Lear),"" compared with the ""effusive flattery"" (ie, excessive and inauthentic praise) of her sisters;
Cinderella, is ""the youngest and humblest but the most beautiful"" of the three sisters and will be the ideal choice for the prince.
Accordingly, given Freud's interpretation, the motif of the three choices includes the idea that the third option is humblest but the most ideal (Number I).
Paragraph 4 asks the question, ""[G]iven a choice of three women, who would wittingly (knowingly) pick the agent of death?"" and proceeds to outline the unconscious mechanisms that explain this choice.  According to Freudian interpretive theory, ""in producing literary motifs, as in the creation of dreams, the psyche imposes its censorship to disguise elements it deems unacceptable, often inverting them.""  For example, ""the third woman is no longer a goddess of death but of life-affirming love"" and so appears to be a desirable choice.  Hence, in a Freudian interpretation, the scenes in which this goddess is chosen ""compensate for the reality of death; they express a wish to escape mortality by opting for love's vitality.""  Thus, the motif of the three choices includes the idea that literary scenes are shaped by the unconscious wish to avoid death (Number II).
According to Paragraph 2, ""Freud conjectures that the well-known [Shakespearean] scenes represent variations on a more common literary motif in which a maiden chooses between three suitors.""  The author then details how Freud ""discern[s] permutations of the pattern in other tales,"" such as the Cinderella story in which ""the youngest and humblest but most beautiful of three sisters becomes the prince's bride.""  Freud even associates the pattern with the myth of the three Fates, which, he claims, represents perhaps the most ""primordial"" (earliest or most basic) version of the literary motif.  By drawing such comparisons, Freud is presented as believing he has proven ""this malleable (adaptable) motif's universality."" Therefore, the motif of the three choices includes the idea that literary scenes represent variations on an older pattern (Number III)."
"135","According to Paragraph 3, when deliberating about the decision to vote, rationally motivated citizens should consider:
the potential benefits of voting.
the known costs associated with voting behavior.
whether voting is likely to have an impact on the election's outcome.","D","25","Citizens who are rationally motivated in the relevant sense, when deciding whether to vote in an election, must weigh the potential benefits of voting against its known costs…  Because the probability that one's vote will have any significant impact on the outcome of the election is so minuscule, however…citizens must conclude that it is not in their best interest to participate in the democratic process… (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, ""when deciding whether to vote in an election,"" citizens ""who are rationally motivated… must weigh the potential benefits of voting against its known costs.""  This implies that, when deliberating about the decision to vote, rationally motivated citizens should consider the potential benefits of voting (Number I) as well as the known costs associated with voting behavior (Number II).
In addition, Paragraph 3 conveys that citizens who are ""rationally motivated in the relevant sense…must conclude that it is not in their best interest to"" vote, as ""the probability that one's vote will have any significant impact on the outcome of the election is so minuscule"" (small).  This implies that, when deliberating about the decision to vote, rationally motivated citizens should also consider whether voting is likely to have an impact on the election's outcome (Number III)."
"136","The ""remarkably simple"" idea behind the Principle of Voter Rationality (Paragraph 1) is most analogous to:","A","25","Let us consider a widely accepted principle, what is called the ""Principle of Voter Rationality.""  It states that rationally motivated members of a democratic society ought to vote, as it is in their own best interest to do so.  The idea behind this principle is remarkably simple, of course: rationally motivated people ought to do whatever is in their own best interest. (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, ""the ""Principle of Voter Rationality"" states that ""members of a democratic society ought to vote"" because ""it is in their own best interest to do so.""  The author specifies that the ""remarkably simple"" idea behind this principle is that ""people ought to do whatever is in their own best interest.""
The argument that it is better to live a religious life rather than to risk the possibility of punishment in the afterlife implies that people ought to live a religious life in the present to avoid being worse off in the future (ie, in the afterlife).  Therefore, this argument is concerned with a person's self-interest, and is based on an assumption about an individual's overall well-being.  Accordingly, this argument is more analogous to the ""remarkably simple"" idea that people ought to do whatever is in their own best interest than any of the following:
the belief that people ought to always tell the truth because honesty is a virtue that accords with universal moral laws (Choice B).  This belief opposes the idea that people ought to do whatever is in their own best interest, as it implies that people ought to do something (ie, tell the truth) whether or not it is in their best interest.
the view that the primary function of political organizations is to promote equality and justice (Choice C).  This view is unrelated to the idea that people ought to do whatever is in their own best interest, as it expresses an opinion about the goals that political organizations should have.
the notion that teamwork depends on an equal contribution from each of the team's members (Choice D).  This notion is dissimilar to the idea that people ought to do whatever is in their own best interest, as it pertains to the shared interests of groups of people (ie, teams and teamwork) whereas the Principle of Voter Rationality refers specifically to the interests of individual people."
"137","The author's position regarding the justification for voting behavior relies on the assumption that citizens should disconnect:","C","25","But other sources of justification are available.  As I see it, it is a commitment to the principles of democracy itself that should compel rational citizens, independently of whether it furthers their own interests, to participate in the democratic process.  For with such a commitment comes a civic duty to prevent the breakdown of one's own democracy and, with this, comes the justification for voting behavior. (Paragraph 5)
In Paragraph 5, the author conveys that ""the justification for voting behavior"" is based on ""a commitment to the principles of democracy.""  The author clarifies that this commitment ""should compel rational citizens"" to vote ""independently of whether it furthers their own interests.""  The author's position therefore assumes that, when justifying voting behavior, citizens should disconnect that behavior from their own self-interest.
(Choice A)  The author explains that ""the probability that any one vote will change the outcome of an election is infinitesimally small"" (Paragraph 2), and that because this probability is ""so minuscule…citizens can be practically certain that the costs of voting will outweigh its potential benefits"" (Paragraph 3).  Because these claims are linked, the author implies that citizens should not disconnect the probability of impacting an election from the certainty of voting costs.
(Choice B)  In Paragraph 5, the author expresses the view that ""a commitment to the principles of democracy itself should compel"" citizens ""to participate in the democratic process"" (ie, to engage in voting behavior).  Therefore, the author's position regarding ""the justification for voting behavior"" does not assume that citizens should disconnect the principles of democracy from the democratic process.
(Choice D)  The author denies ""that voting behavior is 'rationally motivated' [ie, justified]…when it is done for the purpose of influencing the outcome of an election,"" clarifying that ""rational citizens"" should be compelled to vote because they have ""a civic duty to prevent the breakdown of one's own democracy"" (Paragraph 5).  This implies that, according to the author, civic duties provide a rational justification for voting behavior.  Therefore, the author's position does not assume that citizens should disconnect civic duties from rational justification."
"138","In response to the principle that rational citizens ought to vote due to self-interest, the author points out that, if this principle were correct, then the democratic process would break down.  This response is:","D","25","Let us consider a widely accepted principle, what is called the ""Principle of Voter Rationality.""  It states that rationally motivated members of a democratic society ought to vote, as it is in their own best interest to do so. (Paragraph 1)
Citizens who are rationally motivated in the relevant sense, when deciding whether to vote in an election, must weigh the potential benefits of voting against its known costs.  …however, citizens can be practically certain that the costs of voting will outweigh its potential benefits. (Paragraph 3)
Moreover, if we are willing to assume, in the way the principle does, that democratic citizens are rationally motivated, then, given a sufficiently large population of citizens who deliberate about whether to engage in voting behavior, the democratic process should break down.  For each citizen should find that he or she ought to abstain from participating in this process… (Paragraph 4)
The Principle of Voter Rationality tries to justify voting behavior, claiming that ""members of a democratic society ought to vote"" because ""it is in their own best interest to do so"" (Paragraph 1).  In response, the author points out that if this principle were correct, ""the democratic process should break down"" because ""each citizen should find that he or she ought to abstain from"" voting behavior (Paragraph 4), due to the fact that ""the cost of voting will outweigh its potential benefits"" (Paragraph 3).  Therefore, the author's response is significant because it illustrates that the Principle of Voter Rationality is self-defeating.
By contrast, none of the following would accurately characterize the author's response:
insignificant, because the Principle of Voter Rationality does not provide satisfactory justification for engaging in voting behavior (Choice A).  Rather, the fact that the Principle of Voter Rationality does not provide satisfactory justification for voting behavior illustrates that the author's response is significant: it supports the author's claim that ""there are excellent reasons to reject this principle"" (Paragraph 2).
insignificant, because the author claims that the democratic process is fully intact (Choice B).  Rather, the claim that ""the democratic process is fully intact"" (Paragraph 5) emphasizes that the author's response is significant: it reinforces the point that the Principle of Voter Rationality cannot be correct because the democratic process has not broken down.
significant, because the author implies that citizens ought to exercise their will through the process of elections (Choice C).  The author's response is significant not because it implies that citizens ought to exercise their will through the process of elections (ie, through voting), but because it establishes that the Principle of Voter Rationality is an inadequate source of ""justification for voting behavior"" (Paragraph 5)."
"139","Based on the passage, which of the following would be the most likely reason behind the author's discussion of the Principle of Voter Rationality?","B","25","Let us consider a widely accepted principle, what is called the ""Principle of Voter Rationality""…If true, the principle elegantly justifies the scaffolding that upholds democracy itself: citizen engagement with the democratic process. (Paragraph 1)
As it turns out, there are excellent reasons to reject this principle. (Paragraph 2)
But other sources of justification are available.  As I see it, it is a commitment to the principles of democracy itself…and, with this, comes the justification for voting behavior. (Paragraph 5)
The author specifies that (s)he will ""consider a widely accepted principle"" pertaining to the justification of voting behavior, the ""Principle of Voter Rationality"" (Paragraph 1).  After arguing that ""there are excellent reasons to reject this principle"" (Paragraph 2), the author then illustrates that ""other sources of justification [for voting behavior] are available"" (Paragraph 5).  Most likely, then, the reason for the author's discussion is to expose the Principle of Voter Rationality as a ""widely accepted"" but faulty (flawed) conception of the justification for voting behavior.
(Choice A)  The Principle of Voter Rationality asserts that citizens ought to ""exercise their will through the process of elections"" because ""it is in their own best interest to do so"" (Paragraph 1).  Because the author intends to establish that ""there are excellent reasons to reject this principle"" (Paragraph 2), (s)he most likely does not discuss this principle to encourage citizens to exercise their will through the process of elections as the principle suggests.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 5 states that the Principle of Voter Rationality ""assumes, falsely, that voting behavior is 'rationally motivated'…only when it is done"" out of self-interest.  By contrast, the author claims that ""rational citizens"" should instead be compelled to vote because they have ""a civic duty to"" do so.  Therefore, the author rejects the idea that voting behavior is driven by self-interest rather than civic duty.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 5 states that ""it is a commitment to the principles of democracy itself that should compel rational citizens…to participate in the democratic process.""  The author further explains that ""with such a commitment comes a civic duty to prevent the breakdown of one's own democracy and, with this, comes the justification for voting behavior.""  This means that citizens must vote to prevent the breakdown of the democracy.  However, this justification is discussed separately from what the author says about the Principle of Voter Rationality, which (s)he introduces primarily to debunk."
"140","The author's position on voting behavior suggests that he or she would be most likely to disapprove of which of the following:","C","25","But what can be said about the nature of ""civic duties,"" and why should we suppose that there are any such duties in the first place?  For my part, I believe that a democratic government's policies and its citizens' civic duty to vote derive from the more general obligation upon man to help his fellow citizen, to increase the welfare of others with no expectation of a reward, a duty for altruism… (Paragraph 6)
The author claims in Paragraph 5 that ""a commitment to the principles of democracy…should compel rational citizens…to participate in the democratic process"" (ie, voting).  In Paragraph 6, the author expresses a belief that ""a democratic government's policies and its citizens' civic duty to vote derive from the more general obligation upon man to help his fellow citizen…a duty for altruism.""
Accordingly, political candidates who make campaign promises merely to gain wider voter support violate this altruistic obligation of a democratic government by focusing on their own benefit and not on those of the people.  These promises are made not from a genuine desire to increase the welfare of others, but simply to gain a reward (ie, victory in a political election).  Therefore, the author would likely disapprove of political candidates who make selfish campaign promises of this sort.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 5 states that ""the Principle of Voter Rationality…assumes, falsely, that voting behavior is 'rationally motivated' when and only when it is done for the purpose of influencing the outcome of an election.""  Although the author rejects this particular assumption about ""rationally motivated"" voting behavior, the passage never suggests that the author would reject or disapprove of rational methods of decision making in general.  Accordingly, there is no reason to think the author would disapprove of politicians who use such methods.
(Choices B and D)  In Paragraph 5, the author expresses the belief that citizens have ""a civic duty"" to ""participate in the democratic process"" (ie, to vote).  This suggests that the author would approve of government efforts to minimize both personal costs and any skepticism associated with voting behavior, as such efforts would increase the likelihood that a larger number of citizens would fulfill their civic duty to vote."
"141","Which of the following assertions about modern dancers is NOT implied by the passage?","B","26","In the 1890s…a group of pioneering dancers dared to challenge the rigid 350-year-old protocols of classical ballet.  The likes of Isadora Duncan, Loie Fuller, and Ruth St. Denis rebelled against ballet tradition while simultaneously rejecting the alternative world of vaudeville….These artists managed to break through the prejudice of tradition, clearing the way for the advent of modern dance in the 20th century. (Paragraph 1)
Martha Graham, a student of St. Denis and Shawn, went on to develop a radical new system of movement….The visual effects were startling, and the iconoclastic Graham went so far as to assert that the technique ""represented the human being's inner conflicts."" (Paragraph 3)
Building on the foundation of her precursors, Graham…made modern dance…""an established art form that was no longer merely regarded as an avant-garde aberration."" (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 1 emphasizes that ""pioneering dancers dared to challenge the rigid 350-year-old protocols (systems of rules) of classical ballet"" and that they ""rebelled against ballet tradition while simultaneously rejecting the alternative world of vaudeville (comedic stage show featuring song and dance).""  Paragraph 1 also conveys that ""these artists managed to break through the prejudice of tradition.""  According to Paragraph 3, the ""iconoclastic"" (deliberately nonconformist) Martha Graham later developed ""a radical new system of movement"" whose ""visual effects were startling.""  Lastly, Paragraph 5 indicates that modern dance had previously been ""regarded as an avant-garde (ahead of its time) aberration (abnormality).""
These statements show that modern dancers were daring and rebellious and even produced new dance movements that were ""startling"" to audiences.  They were therefore more concerned with breaking from tradition than with how their artistry was received.  Consequently, the passage does not imply that modern dancers aimed to make dance more acceptable to the general public.
By contrast, the following assertions about modern dancers are implied by the passage:
They were conscious of influencing the audience's emotional state (Choice A).  Paragraph 2 states that ""the second generation of artists"" was ""determined to raise the audience's consciousness about contemporary social concerns.""  Paragraph 2 then describes modern dancers as ""dramatizing events on stage to inspire a collective emotional response.""
They strove to collaborate on productions with other types of artists (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 5, Graham, who set the new standards for modern dance, ""also strove to make the works she created and choreographed holistic.""  For example, Graham ""collaborated with sculptor Isamu Noguchi on stage sets, consulted with the designer Halston on costumes, and partnered with composers such as Louis Horst and Samuel Barber.""
They sought to effect change beyond the sphere of dance (Choice D).  Paragraph 2 describes modern dancers as ""dramatizing events on stage to inspire a collective emotional response "" as a way ""to spur sociopolitical change."""
"142","The author implies that the dance styles of Duncan and Fuller departed from convention because they:","C","26","In the 1890s, the world of American dance underwent a profound transformation when a group of pioneering dancers dared to challenge the rigid 350-year-old protocols of classical ballet.

Paragraph 1 also specifies that Isadora Duncan and Loie Fuller ""rebelled against ballet tradition while simultaneously rejecting the alternative world of vaudeville (comedic stage show featuring song and dance).""  Consequently, the author implies that the dance styles of Duncan and Fuller departed from convention because they avoided both vaudeville and the strict dance patterns associated with ballet.
By contrast, the author does not imply that the dance styles of Duncan and Fuller departed from convention because they:
promoted jagged and stark styles of dance movement (Choice A).  Paragraph 4 explains that as modern dance ""evolved"" under Martha Graham's influence, ""it became the antithesis (opposite) of ballet"" and that ""the new dance style was…angular, jagged, and stark.""  However, neither Duncan nor Fuller is said to have promoted jagged and stark styles of dance movement.  On the contrary, Paragraph 1 describes Duncan as performing ""natural, flowing movements.""
rejected dance traditions from other cultures (Choice B).  Paragraph 1 indicates that ""St. Denis and her partner Ted Shawn incorporated elements of Native American and East Asian ritualistic dance into their work.""  However, the passage never indicates whether Duncan or Fuller rejected (or accepted) dance traditions from other cultures.
initiated movements from the solar plexus (Choice D).  Paragraph 1 states that ""pioneering"" dancer Isadora Duncan ""performed natural, flowing movements that she claimed 'emanated (originated) from her solar plexus (the central area of the abdomen below the rib cage).'""  However, the passage does not make a similar claim about Loie Fuller."
"143","The description of the ""Graham technique"" of dance largely reveals that:","A","26","The ""Graham technique""…was organic; based on the natural rhythm of breathing, it exaggerated the muscular contraction and release, as well as the consequent flexion of the spine, required to breathe.

While ballet was made to appear effortless, Graham's main goal as a choreographer was to display the physical exertion of articulating emotion through the body's movement. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 3, ""Martha Graham…went on to develop a radical new system of movement.""  The resulting ""Graham technique"" of modern dance was ""organic; based on the natural rhythm of breathing, it exaggerated the muscular contraction and release, as well as the consequent flexion of the spine, required to breathe.""
Paragraph 4 then explains that ""[a]s modern dance evolved, it became the antithesis (opposite) of ballet, which followed strict patterns of movement and aimed to be light and graceful.""  For instance, ""[w]hile ballet was made to appear effortless, Graham's main goal as a choreographer was to display the physical exertion of articulating (expressing) emotion through the body's movement.""  Consequently, the passage description of the ""Graham technique"" of dance largely reveals that liberating (freeing) dance from ballet conventions featured overt (unconcealed) indications of physical effort.
By contrast, the description of the ""Graham technique"" of dance does not reveal that
lingering prejudices were a hindrance to the development of new dance techniques (Choice B).  Paragraph 1 states that initially dancers had to ""break through the prejudice of tradition"" in order to establish new dance techniques.  However, the description in Paragraph 3 does not indicate that such prejudices hindered the later development of the ""Graham technique.""  Moreover, Paragraph 3 claims that ""contraction became a regular feature of modern dance.""
emphasizing the connection between the professional dancer and the audience was essential (Choice C).  Paragraph 3 states that ""the 'Graham technique' originated from her cardinal belief that movement expresses the emotions that people attempt to conceal and words are inadequate to express.""  However, the passage never implies that performing the technique requires establishing any connection with the audience.
highlighting sociopolitical issues in modern dance had become increasingly common (Choice D).  Paragraph 2 explains that ""by dramatizing events on stage to inspire a collective emotional response, dance became a vehicle designed to spur sociopolitical change"" in the early 20th century.  However, the description of the ""Graham technique"" in Paragraph 3 never connects the technique with sociopolitical issues."
"144","Graham's contention that movement expresses the emotions that people attempt to conceal and words are inadequate to express is:","C","26","Martha Graham…develop[ed] a radical new system of movement.

Paragraph 3 also states that Graham ""went so far as to assert that the technique 'represented the human being's inner conflicts.'""  However, the passage never explains Graham's contention that movement expresses the emotions that people attempt to conceal and words are inadequate to express.
By contrast, Graham's contention is not:
exemplified by scenes from Appalachian Spring discussed in the passage (Choice A).  Paragraph 5 mentions Graham's ""modern 'ballet' Appalachian Spring""; however, the passage never discusses specific scenes from this work.
undermined by additional details provided in the passage (Choice B).  Paragraph 3 describes the ""Graham technique"" as ""based on the natural rhythm of breathing"" and exaggerating ""the muscular contraction and release, as well as the consequent flexion of the spine, required to breathe.""  However, the passage provides no additional details about the technique that would serve to undermine (ie, challenge) Graham's contention that movement expresses the emotions that people attempt to conceal and words are inadequate to express.
diminished by her desire to create holistic works (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 6, ""Graham also strove to make the works she created and choreographed holistic.""   Paragraph 6 then explains that Graham ""collaborated with sculptor Isamu Noguchi on stage sets, consulted with the designer Halston on costumes, and partnered with composers, such as Louis Horst and Samuel Barber"" in order to achieve her aim.  Accordingly, these collaborative efforts had to do with the presentation of the performance and not with whether the physical dance technique expressed concealed emotion."
"145","Based on passage information, the prime objective of modern dance is most probably:","B","26","In the 1890s…a group of pioneering dancers dared to challenge the rigid 350-year-old protocols of classical ballet.  The likes of Isadora Duncan, Loie Fuller, and Ruth St. Denis rebelled against ballet tradition while simultaneously rejecting the alternative world of vaudeville.  Duncan, in particular, was a proponent of what was deemed ""uninhibited freedom of movement""…[S]he performed natural, flowing movements she claimed ""emanated from her solar plexus.""  For her part, Fuller combined billowing costumes, dramatic lighting, and improvised movements in attempting to imitate natural phenomena, as exemplified by her ""serpentine"" dance. (Paragraph 1)
The second generation of artists, which included Doris Humphrey and Lester Horton, continued to loosen dance from the restraints of classical ballet. (Paragraph 2)
Martha Graham, a student of St. Denis and Shawn, went on to develop a radical new system of movement…The new technique was organic; based on the natural rhythm of breathing, it exaggerated the muscular contraction and release, as well as the consequent flexion of the spine, required to breathe. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 1 states that ""dancers…rebelled against ballet tradition while simultaneously rejecting the alternative world of vaudeville and that Duncan…was a proponent of…'uninhibited freedom of movement.'""  Paragraph 1 further specifies that Duncan ""performed natural, flowing movements she claimed 'emanated from her solar plexus (the central area of the abdomen below the rib cage).'""  Meanwhile, Fuller used ""improvised movements in attempting to imitate natural phenomena,"" and St. Denis and Ted Shawn ""incorporated elements of Native American and East Asian ritualistic dance into their work.""
Paragraph 2 then explains that ""[t]he second generation of artists…continued to loosen dance from the restraints of classical ballet.""  As Paragraph 3 details, ""Martha Graham…went on to develop a radical new system of movement,"" one that was not only ""organic"" and ""based on the natural rhythm of breathing,"" but that sought ""to display the physical exertion of articulating emotion through the body's movement.""
Therefore, the prime objective of modern dance is most probably to facilitate a broader range of physical expression.
By contrast, passage information does not suggest that the prime objective of modern dance is:
to depict current sociopolitical controversies before audiences (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 2, ""the second generation of artists…were also determined to raise the audience's consciousness about contemporary social concerns.""  More specifically, ""[f]or a while…by dramatizing events on stage to inspire a collective emotional response, dance became a vehicle designed to spur sociopolitical change"" (Paragraph 2).  Consequently, depicting current sociopolitical controversies before audiences was at one time an important objective of modern dance; however, it was not the prime objective nor even an enduring aim.
to allow dancers to perform nonlinear movements on stage (Choice C).  Paragraph 4 states that ""[a]s modern dance evolved, it became the antithesis (opposite) of ballet"" and that ""the choreography featured nonlinear movements.""  Therefore, allowing dancers to perform nonlinear movements on stage was an aim of modern dance, but the passage never suggests that it was the prime objective.
to enable dancers to convey their personalities through movement (Choice D).  According to the passage, modern dancers ""managed to break through the prejudice of tradition"" (Paragraph 1) to create new styles of movement that were often distinctive, such as Fuller's ""serpentine"" dance or the ""Graham technique"" (Paragraph 3).  However, the passage never indicates that the aim of such techniques or of modern dance was to enable dancers to convey their particular personalities."
"146","Which of the following claims about the characters of Candide and Zadig is NOT implied by the passage argument?","C","27","Given this understanding, those who see Voltaire through the lens of Candide would likely be shocked to read another of his works, Zadig.  The stories are similar in that both title characters experience a long series of undeserved evils.  However, whereas Candide moves from believing in Pangloss' worldview to eventually rejecting it, Zadig's lesson seems to be the exact opposite. (Paragraph 2)
That assessment is fitting not only in Zadig's case but also in that of Candide and his companions, who are repeatedly the victims of other people's greed, selfishness, and violence….  Both tales, then, are best understood as a commentary not on the callousness of providence, but on the heartlessness of humanity. (Paragraph 5)
According to the passage author, both Candide and Zadig suffer through no fault of their own.  For instance, Paragraph 2 states that their ""stories are similar in that both title characters experience a long series of undeserved evils.""  Paragraph 5 expands on this point, describing how ""not only in Zadig's case but also in that of Candide and his companions,"" the characters ""are repeatedly the victims of other people's greed, selfishness, and violence.""
Thus, by describing the two characters as ""victims"" subjected to ""undeserved evils,"" the passage indicates that neither Candide nor Zadig is responsible for causing the misfortunes he experiences.  Consequently, the passage does not imply that Candide and Zadig are to blame for their own suffering.
  (Choices A and B)  Both Candide and Zadig are given explanations for the existence of evil; and Both Candide and Zadig come to revise their views of the world.  One of the author's comparisons between Candide and Zadig concerns the justifications each character is given for the evils they encounter.  Paragraph 1 states that in Candide, Dr. Pangloss ""offers many supposed proofs that all events 'must necessarily be for the best end.'""  These arguments explain how the characters' ""horrible and comically absurd misfortunes"" are part of a world that is ""ordered to produce the greatest good.""  Paragraph 2 describes a similar situation in Zadig: ""Convinced of the unfair cruelty of life, Zadig is visited by the angel Jesrad, who justifies many of the apparent tragedies Zadig has witnessed.""  According to Jesrad, ""[E]verything that occurs 'ought to be, in its proper time and place.'""
In addition, Paragraph 2 relates how each character changes with regard to these ideas, stating: ""[B]oth title characters experience a long series of undeserved evils.  However, whereas Candide moves from believing in Pangloss' worldview to eventually rejecting it, Zadig's lesson seems to be the exact opposite.""  Therefore, the passage implies that Candide and Zadig both receive explanations for the existence of evil, and both come to revise their views about the world.
(Choice D)  Both Candide and Zadig face misfortunes inspired by Voltaire's own life.  According to Paragraph 3, ""Candide was written long after Zadig, near the end of a career in which Voltaire faced frequent difficulties of his own….  Although the writer's hardships never approached the severity of those visited upon his characters, it is easy to imagine them influencing both his outlook and his stories.""  Therefore, the passage implies that Voltaire most likely based some of Candide's and Zadig's misfortunes on events from his own life."
"147","Based on the passage, one can most reasonably conclude that Voltaire:
received popular acclaim but political backlash.
struggled to find an audience for his writing.
viewed human suffering as ultimately unexplainable.","A","27","Candide was written long after Zadig, near the end of a career in which Voltaire faced frequent difficulties of his own.  The satirizing and free-thinking that made his novels so popular with readers were not always appreciated by other aristocrats or monarchs, and Voltaire found it necessary to move from city to city throughout Europe.  Although the writer's hardships never approached the severity of those visited upon his characters, it is easy to imagine them influencing both his outlook and his stories. (Paragraph 3)
The passage conveys that Voltaire experienced both success and hostility as a result of his writing.  According to Paragraph 3, ""The satirizing and free-thinking that made his novels so popular with readers were not always appreciated by other aristocrats or monarchs, and Voltaire found it necessary to move from city to city throughout Europe.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that although Voltaire's novels were well liked by many people, they also offended those in positions of power, causing him to experience ""hardships.""  In other words, Voltaire received popular acclaim but political backlash (Number I).
  (Number II)  struggled to find an audience for his writing.  Paragraph 3 describes the ""satirizing and free-thinking that made [Voltaire's] novels so popular with readers.""  Therefore, the passage does not indicate that Voltaire struggled to find an audience for his writing, but that Voltaire's works were read and enjoyed by many.
(Number III)  viewed human suffering as ultimately unexplainable.  Paragraph 5 describes how ""other people's greed, selfishness, and violence"" cause Candide and Zadig to suffer, noting that ""[b]oth tales, then, are best understood as a commentary…on the heartlessness of humanity.""  The passage concludes with the assertion that ""in Voltaire's estimation, it is people's wickedness that truly fills the world with misery.""  Consequently, the passage portrays Voltaire as attributing human suffering to people's immoral actions; it does not suggest that Voltaire viewed human suffering as ultimately unexplainable."
"148","Which of the following best describes how the passage author treats the idea that the differences between the stories of Zadig and Candide might reflect changes in Voltaire's own outlook over time?","C","27","Candide was written long after Zadig, near the end of a career in which Voltaire faced frequent difficulties of his own….  Although the writer's hardships never approached the severity of those visited upon his characters, it is easy to imagine them influencing both his outlook and his stories.  A fairly straightforward conclusion would be that Zadig reflects a younger and more optimistic Voltaire, while Candide expresses the more cynical sentiments of a man grown frustrated at the world's ignorance and persecution. (Paragraph 3)
However, there is another way to view the two works….  Jesrad explains: ""The wicked…are always unhappy.  They serve to prove and try the small number of the just that are scattered throughout the earth.""  Thus, the angel implies that human cruelty is to blame for most of the unhappiness in the world. (Paragraph 4)
That assessment is fitting not only in Zadig's case but also in that of Candide and his companions, who are repeatedly the victims of other people's greed, selfishness, and violence….  Both tales, then, are best understood as a commentary not on the callousness of providence, but on the heartlessness of humanity.  Life is replete with pointless suffering, even if some misfortune could potentially serve a greater purpose.  But in Voltaire's estimation, it is people's wickedness that truly fills the world with misery. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 3 mentions that ""Voltaire faced frequent difficulties"" throughout his career, and the author asserts that ""it is easy to imagine [those difficulties] influencing both his outlook and his stories.""  In particular, this influence could plausibly explain why Zadig and Candide seem to present very different messages about suffering.  According to the author, a ""fairly straightforward conclusion"" would be that Voltaire's view changed over time, such that ""Zadig reflects a younger and more optimistic Voltaire, while Candide expresses the more cynical sentiments of a man grown frustrated at the world's ignorance and persecution.""
However, although the author considers that view reasonable, he or she ultimately favors a different interpretation.  Paragraph 4 states that ""there is another way to view the two works,"" based on a consistent theme that ""human cruelty is to blame for most of the unhappiness in the world.""  According to Paragraph 5, ""That assessment is fitting not only in Zadig's case but also in that of Candide and his companions, who are repeatedly the victims of other people's greed, selfishness, and violence.""  Thus, the passage author argues that, despite the apparent differences between the two stories, both of them ""are best understood as a commentary…on the heartlessness of humanity.""
Therefore, although the passage author considers the possibility that the differences between the novels might reflect changes in Voltaire's own outlook over time, he or she treats this idea as less convincing than an alternative analysis of the stories.
  (Choice A)  The passage author treats this idea as an implausible explanation of the stories' differences.  Paragraph 3 states that ""[a]lthough [Voltaire's] hardships never approached the severity of those visited upon his characters, it is easy to imagine them influencing both his outlook and his stories.""  The passage author then mentions the ""fairly straightforward conclusion"" that Zadig and Candide reflect changes in Voltaire's outlook over time.  Accordingly, he or she depicts this idea as a reasonable interpretation, despite going on to argue that ""there is another way to view the two works"" (Paragraph 4).
(Choice B)  The passage author treats this idea as uninformed by historical evidence.  According to Paragraph 3, Voltaire's ""satirizing and free-thinking…were not always appreciated by other aristocrats or monarchs, and Voltaire found it necessary to move from city to city throughout Europe.""  Therefore, the passage author portrays the idea of ""the writer's hardships...influencing both his outlook and his stories"" as partially based on historical evidence about Voltaire's life.
(Choice D)  The passage author treats this idea as overlooking the role of satire in the stories.  Paragraph 1 discusses ""Candide, which satirizes…18th-century Europe"" and in which ""the novel's characters endure a constant succession of horrible and comically absurd misfortunes.""  Paragraph 3 later mentions that ""Candide was written long after Zadig.""  Consequently, the possibility that ""Zadig reflects a younger and more optimistic Voltaire, while Candide expresses the more cynical sentiments of a man grown frustrated at the world's ignorance and persecution"" (Paragraph 3) is connected to Voltaire's use of satire in depicting his characters' suffering."
"149","The passage author most likely mentions that Dr. Pangloss teaches ""metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology"" (Paragraph 1) in order to:","D","27","Voltaire's most famous work is undoubtedly Candide, which satirizes both 18th-century Europe and the philosophy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.  In particular, the character of Dr. Pangloss (who teaches ""metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology"") parodies Leibniz's view that this is the best of all possible worlds.  While Pangloss offers many supposed proofs that all events ""must necessarily be for the best end,"" the novel's characters endure a constant succession of horrible and comically absurd misfortunes. (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, Voltaire's work Candide ""satirizes…the philosophy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.  In particular, the character of Dr. Pangloss (who teaches 'metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology') parodies Leibniz's view that this is the best of all possible worlds.""  By highlighting the over-the-top and silly-sounding portrayal of Pangloss' subject matter, the passage author illustrates a way in which Voltaire holds Leibniz's ideas up for ridicule.  Accordingly, the passage author most likely mentions that Dr. Pangloss teaches ""metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology"" in order to emphasize that the view Pangloss represents is depicted as absurd.
  (Choice A)  suggest a common theme between Candide and Voltaire's other satires.  Paragraph 1 discusses ""Candide, which satirizes both 18th-century Europe and the philosophy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.""  One part of that satire involves a mocking description of ""the character of Dr. Pangloss (who teaches 'metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology').""  However, the passage author never discusses whether the presence of such descriptions is a common theme of Voltaire's other satires.
(Choice B)  foreshadow a contrast between the views of Pangloss and Jesrad.  According to Paragraph 1, ""Pangloss offers many supposed proofs that all events 'must necessarily be for the best end.'""  Paragraph 2 later describes how ""Zadig is visited by the angel Jesrad, who justifies many of the apparent tragedies Zadig has witnessed.""  For example, ""[t]he man whose house burned down found a hidden treasure beneath it.""  Therefore, the passage author does not draw a contrast between the views of Pangloss and Jesrad; rather, both characters maintain that every event is part of a plan for the greater good.
(Choice C)  illustrate the importance of Leibniz's philosophical position.  According to Paragraph 1, ""Dr. Pangloss (who teaches 'metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology') parodies Leibniz's view that this is the best of all possible worlds.""  The passage author notes that ""[w]hile Pangloss offers many supposed proofs that all events 'must necessarily be for the best end,' the novel's characters endure a constant succession of horrible and comically absurd misfortunes.""  Therefore, the passage author's mention of Pangloss' subject matter is not meant to depict the importance of Leibniz's philosophical position; rather, it serves to illustrate how Voltaire mocked that position in his novel."
"150","Which of the following would be the best example of the passage author's claim that, in Voltaire's stories, humankind is portrayed as the cause of most of the suffering in the world?","A","27","Given this understanding, those who see Voltaire through the lens of Candide would likely be shocked to read another of his works, Zadig.  The stories are similar in that both title characters experience a long series of undeserved evils. (Paragraph 2)
On several occasions, Zadig laments that he has been punished for doing what is right: ""Knowledge, virtue, and courage, have hitherto served only to make me miserable.""  While he never wavers from righteousness, he does question why evils befall those who do not deserve them.  Jesrad explains: ""The wicked…are always unhappy.  They serve to prove and try the small number of the just that are scattered throughout the earth.""  Thus, the angel implies that human cruelty is to blame for most of the unhappiness in the world. (Paragraph 4)
That assessment is fitting not only in Zadig's case but also in that of Candide and his companions, who are repeatedly the victims of other people's greed, selfishness, and violence….  Life is replete with pointless suffering, even if some misfortune could potentially serve a greater purpose.  But in Voltaire's estimation, it is people's wickedness that truly fills the world with misery. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 2, both Candide and Zadig suffer through no fault of their own, as ""both title characters experience a long series of undeserved evils.""  The passage author further suggests that most of this suffering is deliberately caused by other people.  For instance, Paragraph 4 cites Zadig's question of ""why evils befall those who do not deserve them.""  In response, the angel Jesrad explains: ""'The wicked…serve to prove (test) and try the small number of the just that are scattered throughout the earth.'""  Thus, the story conveys the view that human beings cruelly cause each other to suffer.
Paragraph 5 describes this view as accurate ""not only in Zadig's case but also in that of Candide and his companions, who are repeatedly the victims of other people's greed, selfishness, and violence.""  The passage concludes that ""in Voltaire's estimation, it is people's wickedness that truly fills the world with misery.""  Therefore, according to the passage author, Voltaire portrayed most suffering as resulting from people's immoral intentions to harm each other.
Consequently, the best example of this claim would be a story in which a man loses his freedom when his country is destroyed by invaders.  In this case, the man's suffering is caused by the harmful actions of other human beings.
  By contrast, none of the following examples represent suffering that is caused by a person's choice to harm others:
A man loses his possessions when a storm sinks the ship carrying them (Choice B).  In this case, the man's suffering is caused by a natural disaster, not another person intentionally causing him harm.
A man loses most of his pack animals when he takes them on a dangerous journey (Choice C).  This description does not indicate that the man embarks on the journey due to someone else's harmful intentions.
A man loses faith in a woman's love when he learns misleading information about her (Choice D).  The suffering in this case results from a mistake or misunderstanding; there is no suggestion that someone has intentionally caused harm to the couple."
"151","The claim that Candide is Voltaire's most famous work is:","B","27","Voltaire's most famous work is undoubtedly Candide, which satirizes both 18th-century Europe and the philosophy of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.  In particular, the character of Dr. Pangloss (who teaches ""metaphysico-theologo-cosmolonigology"") parodies Leibniz's view that this is the best of all possible worlds.  While Pangloss offers many supposed proofs that all events ""must necessarily be for the best end,"" the novel's characters endure a constant succession of horrible and comically absurd misfortunes. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 begins with the claim that ""Voltaire's most famous work is undoubtedly Candide.""  However, although the passage author discusses various details of the story, he or she provides no further information to justify the assertion that it is Voltaire's most famous work.  Therefore, that claim is presented without the inclusion of supporting evidence.
  (Choice A)  supported by readers' surprise at the content of Zadig.  Paragraph 2 asserts that ""those who see Voltaire through the lens of Candide would likely be shocked to read another of his works, Zadig,"" because the two stories appear to have contradictory messages.  Specifically, ""whereas Candide moves from believing in Pangloss' worldview to eventually rejecting it, Zadig's lesson seems to be the exact opposite.""  Therefore, the claim that readers might be surprised by the content of Zadig is based on its seeming divergence from Candide.  However, this claim does not depend on how well known or obscure each of the works may be.  For instance, even if Zadig were Voltaire's most famous work, its content might surprise readers who had read Candide first.
(Choice C)  in tension with the claim that Voltaire's works convey similar messages.  The statement that ""Voltaire's most famous work is undoubtedly Candide"" (Paragraph 1) might be true (or false) regardless of whether Voltaire's works convey similar messages.  For example, the author's claim that Candide and Zadig ""are similar in that both title characters experience a long series of undeserved evils"" (Paragraph 2) depends on the contents of those stories, not on the number of people who have read them.  Therefore, these claims are not in tension with each other.
(Choice D)  justified by the relative obscurity of Voltaire's other writings.  Although Paragraph 1 states that ""Voltaire's most famous work is undoubtedly Candide,"" the passage never discusses how well known Voltaire's other works may be.  Likewise, the passage never suggests that Voltaire's other works are obscure."
"152","Which of the following quotes cited in the passage LEAST supports the passage author's argument?","A","27","While Pangloss offers many supposed proofs that all events ""must necessarily be for the best end,"" the novel's characters endure a constant succession of horrible and comically absurd misfortunes.  Voltaire's clear message is that life—far from being ordered to produce the greatest good—is full of unnecessary suffering. (Paragraph 1)
Convinced of the unfair cruelty of life, Zadig is visited by the angel Jesrad, who justifies many of the apparent tragedies Zadig has witnessed….  Thus, Jesrad explains, ""Men…judge of all without knowing anything,"" but everything that occurs ""ought to be, in its proper time and place, according to the immutable decrees of him who comprehends all."" (Paragraph 2)
Jesrad explains: ""The wicked…are always unhappy.  They serve to prove and try the small number of the just that are scattered throughout the earth.""  Thus, the angel implies that human cruelty is to blame for most of the unhappiness in the world. (Paragraph 4)
That assessment is fitting not only in Zadig's case but also in that of Candide and his companions, who are repeatedly the victims of other people's greed, selfishness, and violence….  Both tales, then, are best understood as a commentary not on the callousness of providence, but on the heartlessness of humanity.  Life is replete with pointless suffering, even if some misfortune could potentially serve a greater purpose.  But in Voltaire's estimation, it is people's wickedness that truly fills the world with misery. (Paragraph 5)
According to the passage author, both Candide and Zadig portray the world as filled with pointless evil.  Paragraph 1 states that ""Voltaire's clear message [in Candide] is that life—far from being ordered to produce the greatest good—is full of unnecessary suffering.""  Paragraph 4 then suggests that a similar sentiment can be found in Zadig, which attributes such suffering to humanity's immoral choices: ""Thus, the angel implies that human cruelty is to blame for most of the unhappiness in the world.""
Paragraph 5 reinforces this assertion, calling it ""fitting not only in Zadig's case but also in that of Candide and his companions, who are repeatedly the victims of other people's greed, selfishness, and violence.""  Thus, the passage author argues that both works illustrate the theme that ""[l]ife is replete (filled) with pointless suffering.""  He or she concludes that ""in Voltaire's estimation, it is people's wickedness that truly fills the world with misery.""  Therefore, the passage author interprets both Zadig and Candide as implying that human immorality causes extensive evil that does not lead to any greater good.
However, the quote ""Men…judge of all without knowing anything"" appears in the context of the angel Jesrad ""[justifying] many of the apparent tragedies Zadig has witnessed"" (Paragraph 2).  In this way, Jesrad explains how what appeared to be evil ultimately led to greater good.  Thus, by stating that humans make judgments ""without knowing anything,"" the angel casts doubt on the idea that seemingly evil events truly constitute pointless suffering.  Instead, the quote suggests that the suffering serves a greater purpose, aligning with Pangloss' view that ""all events 'must necessarily be for the best end'"" (Paragraph 1).  Consequently, the passage author's argument is least supported by this quote.
  By contrast, the passage author's argument is more supported by each of the following quotes:
""The wicked…are always unhappy"" (Paragraph 4) (Choice B).  This quote suggests that wickedness leads to unhappiness.  Thus, it aligns with the author's interpretation of Zadig as illustrating that ""human cruelty is to blame for most of the unhappiness in the world"" (Paragraph 4).
""There are a ""small number of the just that are scattered throughout the earth"" (Paragraph 4) (Choice C).  By conveying that there are only a small number of just people on earth, this quote implies that the majority of human beings are immoral in their dealings with others.  Accordingly, this sentiment is consistent with the author's claims that Voltaire's works ""are best understood as a commentary…on the heartlessness of humanity"" and that ""in Voltaire's estimation, it is people's wickedness that truly fills the world with misery"" (Paragraph 5).
""Mankind…were not born wolves, and yet they have become wolves"" (Paragraph 5) (Choice D).  The passage author argues that both Candide and Zadig ""are best understood as a commentary not on the callousness of providence (divine will), but on the heartlessness of humanity"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, this quote from Candide accords with that view by suggesting that humans have chosen to corrupt themselves."
"153","Which of the following individuals took actions that contributed to President Garfield's eventual death from infection?
Dr. Willard Bliss
Alexander Graham Bell
Charles Guiteau","C","28","Thus it was that on July 2, 1881, Charles Guiteau could simply walk up to President James A. Garfield and shoot him in broad daylight. (Paragraph 1)
Although Guiteau's bullet would ultimately dim this light for Garfield, the president actually survived the initial attack and for a time appeared headed for recovery.  Tragically, however, the hubris shown by his main physician, Dr. Willard Bliss, would lead instead to weeks of prolonged suffering.  None of the doctors who examined Garfield were able to locate the bullet, and its lingering presence—along with the unwashed hands of the doctors who probed for it—led to an infection. (Paragraph 3)
However, other historians suggest that Dr. Bliss, unwilling to consider challenges to his original assessment, prevented Bell from more thoroughly searching the president's body.  Certainly, Bliss ignored the advice and protestations of other physicians, even as Garfield continued to decline.  With death imminent, Garfield asked to be taken to his seaside cottage, where he died on the 19th of September. (Paragraph 4)
According to the passage, there is a good chance that Garfield would not have died if his primary doctor had acted differently.  Paragraph 3 states that ""the president actually survived the initial attack and for a time appeared headed for recovery.  Tragically, however, the hubris (destructive pride) shown by his main physician, Dr. Willard Bliss, would lead instead to weeks of prolonged suffering.""  Paragraph 4 adds that Dr. Bliss may have ""prevented Bell from more thoroughly searching the president's body"" for the bullet, and furthermore states that ""Bliss ignored the advice and protestations of other physicians, even as Garfield continued to decline.""  Therefore, the passage conveys that the actions of Dr. Willard Bliss contributed to President Garfield's eventual death from infection (Number I).
Paragraph 1 describes how ""on July 2, 1881, Charles Guiteau could simply walk up to President James A. Garfield and shoot him in broad daylight.""  Although Garfield did not die immediately, Guiteau's ""bullet, and its lingering presence…led to an infection"" (Paragraph 3).  As a result, the president ultimately ""died on the 19th of September"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, the passage indicates that the actions of Charles Guiteau contributed to President Garfield's eventual death from infection (Number III).
 (Number II)  Alexander Graham Bell.  According to Paragraph 3, inventor Alexander Graham Bell tried to assist in Garfield's recovery.  By ""attempt[ing] to adapt his patented telephone technology to locate foreign metal in the human body,"" Bell hoped to ""isolate the site of the bullet"" and thus enable Garfield's doctors to remove it.  Although Paragraph 4 states that ""Bell's searches were unsuccessful,"" this fact shows only that Bell was unable to help save the president.  The passage never suggests that Bell's actions contributed to President Garfield's eventual death from infection."
"154","The Republican convention of 1880 required 36 separate rounds of voting over the course of three days before the delegates were finally able to agree on a presidential candidate.  This information most strongly supports which of the following passage claims?","B","28","While serving in the war he was nominated for the House of Representatives but accepted the seat only after President Lincoln declared that the country had more need of him as a congressman than a general.  The reluctant politician would later himself become president under similar circumstances, after multiple factions of a deadlocked Republican convention unexpectedly nominated him instead of their original candidates in 1880. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, Garfield would ""become president…after multiple factions (competing sides) of a deadlocked Republican convention unexpectedly nominated him instead of their original candidates in 1880.""  The additional information that this convention required dozens of rounds of voting over multiple days illustrates that the delegates were in conflict and could not come to a consensus.  Therefore, this information strongly supports the passage claim that Garfield's nomination was a compromise to resolve a deadlock.
 By contrast, the additional information about the 1880 Republican convention provides less support for the following claims, which go beyond the occurrence of the deadlock to speculating about its cause:
Some members of the Republican Party were engaged in corrupt politics (Choice A).  The author describes Garfield as ""[a]n honest man who opposed corruption within the party.""  However, the passage never suggests that party corruption was the root cause of the ""deadlocked Republican convention"" (Paragraph 2).
Some Republicans were disgruntled with the state of the party (Choice C).  Paragraph 1 cites Menke's description that Charles Guiteau ""'had come to identify with a disgruntled (dissatisfied or aggrieved) wing of the Republican Party after his deranged fantasies of winning a post from the new administration had come to nothing.'""  Accordingly, the passage refers to ""a disgruntled wing of the Republican Party"" in the time after Garfield had been elected.  However, it does not discuss whether that wing of the party had been dissatisfied previously or had contributed to the deadlock at the nominating convention.
America still suffered from the lingering divisions of the Civil War (Choice D).  Paragraph 2 implies that the effects of the Civil War were still being felt, as ""Garfield strove both to heal the fractures of the Civil War and to uphold the aims for which it was fought.""  However, the passage never specifies whether those fractures were the reason why convention delegates were deadlocked and unexpectedly nominated Garfield."
"155","The author's description of Charles Guiteau (Paragraph 1) seems to imply that:","B","28","Thus it was that on July 2, 1881, Charles Guiteau could simply walk up to President James A. Garfield and shoot him in broad daylight.  As Richard Menke portrays events, ""Guiteau was in fact a madman who had come to identify with a disgruntled wing of the Republican Party after his deranged fantasies of winning a post from the new administration had come to nothing.""  Believing that God had told him to kill the president, Guiteau thought this act would garner fame for his religious ideas and thereby help to usher in the Apocalypse. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 indicates that Charles Guiteau had both political and religious motivations for assassinating President Garfield.  First, the author presents Menke's description that ""'Guiteau was in fact a madman who had come to identify with a disgruntled (dissatisfied or aggrieved) wing of the Republican Party after his deranged fantasies of winning a post from the new administration had come to nothing.'""  The author then describes the religious dimension of Guiteau's actions: he believed ""God had told him to kill the president"" and thought that the assassination ""would garner fame for his religious ideas and thereby help to usher in the Apocalypse (end of the world).""
Accordingly, Guiteau attributed his political assassination to God's will, and believed that killing President Garfield would simultaneously further both his political and religious goals.  Therefore, the author's description of Charles Guiteau seems to imply that Guiteauviewed achieving religious and political ends as essentially interconnected.
 (Choice A)  Guiteau viewed religion as a necessary tool for achieving his political ends.  According to Paragraph 1, ""Guiteau thought [killing Garfield] would garner fame for his religious ideas and thereby help to usher in the Apocalypse.""  Therefore, Guiteau did not see religion as a tool for achieving his political ends, but rather viewed political assassination within the larger framework of his religious ideas.
(Choices C and D)  Guiteau pretended to hold religious views as an excuse for achieving his political ends through violence; and Guiteau pretended to hold religious and political views as an excuse for avenging a personal grievance.  Based on the passage, Guiteau was genuinely motivated by both political and religious beliefs.  For example, Paragraph 1 conveys that Guiteau both ""'had come to identify with a disgruntled wing of the Republican Party'"" and also ""thought [killing Garfield] would garner fame for his religious ideas and thereby help to usher in the Apocalypse.""  Accordingly, the author's description portrays Guiteau as truly believing in the political and religious ends he pursued; it does not imply that he only pretended to hold religious and political views."
"156","In his ascent to the presidency, Garfield was probably LEAST motivated by which of the following?","D","28","Garfield would go on to join the Union Army, where he attained the rank of major general and argued that black soldiers should receive the same pay as their white compatriots.  While serving in the war he was nominated for the House of Representatives but accepted the seat only after President Lincoln declared that the country had more need of him as a congressman than as a general.  The reluctant politician would later himself become president under similar circumstances, after multiple factions of a deadlocked Republican convention unexpectedly nominated him instead of their original candidates in 1880. (Paragraph 2)
According to the passage, Garfield did not initially seek out either of the political offices to which he was elected.  For example, Paragraph 2 relates that he accepted the congressional seat to which he had been nominated ""only after President Lincoln declared that the country had more need of him as a congressman than as a general.""  The author then describes how ""[t]he reluctant politician would later himself become president under similar circumstances, after multiple factions (competing sides) of a deadlocked Republican convention unexpectedly nominated him instead of their original candidates in 1880.""
Therefore, the passage conveys that Garfield had not originally intended to become either a congressional representative or the president but accepted those nominations and offices only after others pushed for his candidacy.  Consequently, in Garfield's ascent to the presidency, he was probably least motivated by ambition.
 (Choices A and C)  Duty; and Service.  Paragraph 2 suggests that Garfield's entry into politics was based on his sense of duty and service to the country.  Specifically, ""While serving in the war he was nominated for the House of Representatives,"" but he did not accept the seat until ""President Lincoln declared that the country had more need of him as a congressman than as a general.""  Similarly, the author describes Garfield as a ""reluctant politician"" who became president only ""after multiple factions of a deadlocked Republican convention unexpectedly nominated him instead of their original candidates in 1880.""  Therefore, this same sense of duty and service likely motivated Garfield's ascent to the presidency.
(Choice B)  Justice.  According to the passage, Garfield was motivated by a sense of integrity and fair-mindedness.  For example, Paragraph 2 describes him as ""[a]n honest man who opposed corruption within the party.""  Similarly, he sought to ""uphold the aims for which [the Civil War] was fought, until 'the equal sunlight of liberty shall shine upon every man, black or white, in the Union.'""  Therefore, Garfield's commitment to ending corruption and advancing equality suggests that he viewed his ascent to the presidency as a means of promoting justice."
"157","Which of the following would most likely have occurred if Dr. Bliss had displayed more humility as a physician?","B","28","Although Guiteau's bullet would ultimately dim this light for Garfield, the president actually survived the initial attack and for a time appeared headed for recovery.  Tragically, however, the hubris shown by his main physician, Dr. Willard Bliss, would lead instead to weeks of prolonged suffering. (Paragraph 3)
However, other historians suggest that Dr. Bliss, unwilling to consider challenges to his original assessment, prevented Bell from more thoroughly searching the president's body.  Certainly, Bliss ignored the advice and protestations of other physicians, even as Garfield continued to decline.  With death imminent, Garfield asked to be taken to his seaside cottage, where he died on the 19th of September. (Paragraph 4)
Based on the passage, Garfield's own doctor probably bears some blame for the president's death.  For instance, Paragraph 3 states that Garfield ""actually survived the initial attack and for a time appeared headed for recovery.  Tragically, however, the hubris (destructive pride) shown by his main physician, Dr. Willard Bliss, would lead instead to weeks of prolonged suffering.""  Similarly, Paragraph 4 suggests that Bliss was ""unwilling to consider challenges to his original assessment,"" and further adds that he ""ignored the advice and protestations of other physicians, even as Garfield continued to decline.""
Therefore, the passage conveys that Dr. Bliss pridefully insisted on continuing his original course of treatment for Garfield despite its ineffectiveness and the dissenting opinions of other doctors.  Consequently, if Dr. Bliss had displayed more humility as a physician, then he would have been open to considering those other doctors' suggestions.  Most likely, then, the medical treatment given to Garfield would have been modified.
 (Choice A)  Another doctor would have taken over as Garfield's main physician.  Paragraph 4 states that ""Bliss ignored the advice and protestations of other physicians, even as Garfield continued to decline.""  However, Dr. Bliss could have displayed more humility even without another doctor taking over.  For instance, he could have accepted the advice of other physicians and incorporated their suggestions into his plan of treatment.
(Choice C)  Alexander Graham Bell would have identified the location of the bullet.  According to Paragraph 4, historians disagree about whether Bell would have been successful if Dr. Bliss had not interfered.  For instance, ""Menke asserts that Bell's efforts 'would probably have fallen short' regardless.  However, other historians suggest that Dr. Bliss, unwilling to consider challenges to his original assessment, prevented Bell from more thoroughly searching the president's body.""  Therefore, although it is possible that Bell would have located the bullet if Bliss had displayed more humility, the passage also presents the possibility that Bell's efforts would still have ""'fallen short.'""
(Choice D)  The wound caused by the bullet would not have become infected.  According to Paragraph 3, ""None of the doctors who examined Garfield were able to locate the bullet, and its lingering presence—along with the unwashed hands of the doctors who probed for it—led to an infection.""  Therefore, the passage attributes the infection to the bullet itself and the medical hygiene practices of the day, not to Dr. Bliss' lack of humility."
"158","The author's description of Pascal's Wager as a ""purely practical argument"" for belief in God (Paragraph 1) is based on that argument's:","D","29","In the 17th century, Blaise Pascal provided a purely practical argument for theism with his famous ""wager.""  The most basic form of the argument can be understood as follows.  Suppose one believes in God.  This choice includes the loss of certain earthly goods, for instance, time and resources devoted to spiritual matters instead of oneself.  If God does not exist, these goods are lost unnecessarily, but if God does exist, one gains eternal happiness in the afterlife.  On the other hand, by not choosing to believe in God, one gains those earthly goods.  If God does not exist, one loses nothing, but if God does exist, one loses eternal happiness.  Pascal's Wager, then, is essentially a risk/reward analysis.  Believing in God involves a finite loss but may result in an infinite gain, whereas not believing in God risks an infinite loss for the sake of a finite gain.  Therefore, Pascal argues, choosing to believe in God is the only rational decision to make in terms of one's own self-interest. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 describes Pascal's Wager as ""a purely practical argument for theism (belief in God).""  As the author explains, the Wager is based on the possible outcomes of believing or not believing in God, depending on whether God does or does not exist.  Specifically, believing in God means that one loses certain ""time and resources"" in life, but could gain ""eternal happiness in the afterlife"" if God does exist.  On the other hand, if one does not believe in God then one regains those ""time and resources,"" but loses the chance of eternal happiness.
Accordingly, Pascal's point is that one should choose to believe in God, because doing so ""involves a finite loss but may result in an infinite gain, whereas not believing in God risks an infinite loss for the sake of a finite gain"" (Paragraph 1).  However, these possible gains and losses are the entire basis of the argument; the Wager does not include any reasoning designed to show that God's existence is more likely than unlikely.  Therefore, the description of the argument as ""purely practical"" is based on its focus on the potential risks and rewards of belief.
  (Choice A)  attempt to establish the truth of God's existence.  According to Pascal's Wager, ""choosing to believe in God is the only rational decision to make in terms of one's own self-interest"" (Paragraph 1).  This argument is based on the idea that one is better off if one believes in God than if one doesn't, because doing so ""may result in an infinite gain"" if God exists.  However, that argument is merely an appeal to one's self-interest; it is not an argument that God in fact does exist.
(Choices B and C)  portrayal of the choice to believe as a continuous process; and attention to addressing possible objections.  According to Paragraph 3, ""Pascal was well aware of [objections to his argument], and actually raised such worries himself.""  For example, the author points out that ""[Pascal] does not treat choosing to believe in God as a discrete event, but as a process that unfolds throughout one's life (ie, a continuous process),"" which addresses the objection that one cannot simply choose to believe in God.  However, these observations are not related to the claim that Pascal's Wager is ""a purely practical argument for theism.""  Rather, that claim concerns Pascal's assertion about the potential reward of choosing theism over atheism.  In other words, the argument is ""purely practical"" because it is based on the idea that ""choosing to believe in God is the only rational decision to make in terms of one's own self-interest"" (Paragraph 1)."
"159","According to the passage, ""many critics"" object that following Pascal's Wager would be:
inauthentic.
unfeasible.
irrational.","B","29","This argument elicits several objections, the most immediate of which relate to the nature of belief.  First, there is clearly a difference between truly believing in God versus choosing to believe for the sake of a hoped-for reward.  Hence, many critics have viewed the Wager as essentially cynical—not to mention the fact that if God does exist, he would presumably not be fooled by ""belief"" deriving from such mercenary motivations.  Even setting such concerns aside, however, the more important problem is that, put simply, belief doesn't work that way.  One cannot just will oneself to believe a proposition apart from some kind of evidence….  Regardless of the reasons for her wish to believe, belief is not a matter of choice; she cannot make herself believe in God or anything else.  Hence, a prescription to believe would seem to be pointless, even if one accepts that believing would represent the most rational, self-interested decision. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 mentions ""several objections"" that are commonly raised about Pascal's Wager, most of which relate to the nature of belief.  For example, ""there is clearly a difference between truly believing in God versus choosing to believe for the sake of a hoped-for reward.  Hence, many critics have viewed the Wager as essentially cynical (ie, as disparaging what should truly be valued).""  In other words, these critics argue that following Pascal's Wager would not truly constitute belief in God, because believing in order to gain a reward is not the same as genuinely thinking an idea is true.  Therefore, such critics object that a person who follows Pascal's Wager would be inauthentic (Number I).
Pascal's Wager is based on the idea that one should choose to believe in God because of ""one's own self-interest"" (Paragraph 1).  However, Paragraph 2 describes the objection that ""belief doesn't work that way.  One cannot just will oneself to believe a proposition apart from some kind of evidence.""  Furthermore, even if it were possible to just choose to believe in this manner, ""many critics"" also argue that the Wager wouldn't succeed because God ""would presumably not be fooled by 'belief' deriving from such mercenary motivations.""  Consequently, the passage suggests two reasons why the critics object that following Pascal's Wager would be unfeasible (Number II).
  (Number III)  irrational.  Paragraph 2 describes the objection that ""[o]ne cannot just will oneself to believe a proposition apart from some kind of evidence….  Hence, a prescription to believe would seem to be pointless, even if one accepts that believing would represent the most rational, self-interested decision.""  Accordingly, the ""many critics"" do not object to the idea that following Pascal's Wager would be a rational decision.  Rather, they argue that one cannot simply make oneself believe in God, even if it is true that doing so would represent a rational, self-interested decision."
"160","Based on the passage, what does Pascal's Wager suggest about the existence of God?","A","29","Suppose one believes in God.  This choice includes the loss of certain earthly goods, for instance, time and resources devoted to spiritual matters instead of oneself.  If God does not exist, these goods are lost unnecessarily, but if God does exist, one gains eternal happiness in the afterlife. (Paragraph 1)
Thus, Pascal offers advice for those who struggle with their inability to believe: ""Learn of those who have been bound like you…who know the way which you would follow, and who are cured of an ill of which you would be cured.  Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy water, having mass said, etc.  Even this will naturally make you believe...""  In this way, Pascal implies that by practicing religion and engaging in its rituals one may eventually grow to develop real faith, a phenomenon that he suggests is valuable in its own right because it gives one's life meaning and purpose. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 1 describes the potential outcomes of Pascal's Wager.  For instance: ""Suppose one believes in God….  [I]f God does exist, one gains eternal happiness in the afterlife.""  Accordingly, Pascal argues that belief in God is clearly beneficial if God does exist.
In addition, Paragraph 3 presents Pascal's ""advice for those who struggle with their inability to believe.""  Pascal argues that a person who does not believe should begin to behave like those who do, because ""by practicing religion and engaging in its rituals one may eventually grow to develop real faith, a phenomenon that he suggests is valuable in its own right because it gives one's life meaning and purpose.""  Thus, Pascal contends that even if God does not exist, believing in God could improve a person's life.  Therefore, Pascal's Wager suggests that belief in God could be beneficial regardless of whether God exists.
  (Choices B and D)  Belief in God is beneficial only if God does exist; and Whether God actually exists is unimportant.  According to Paragraph 3, Pascal implies that ""practicing religion and engaging in its rituals…is valuable in its own right because it gives one's life meaning and purpose.""  Hence, Pascal suggests that believing in God could be beneficial even if God does not exist.  Nevertheless, whether God actually exists is still extremely important to those who follow Pascal's Wager, because that fact determines whether belief in God would lead to the ""infinite gain"" of ""eternal happiness in the afterlife"" (Paragraph 1).
(Choice C)  Whether God exists can be determined in a practical sense.  Paragraph 1 states that ""Pascal provided a purely practical argument for theism (belief in God) with his famous 'wager.'""  However, Pascal never suggests that his Wager helps determine whether God exists.  Rather, the Wager is ""purely practical"" because it is based solely on whether believing in God is ""the most rational decision to make in terms of one's own self-interest."""
"161","Which of the following decisions in a woman's life would be most similar to the way Pascal's Wager is described in Paragraph 3?","A","29","However, as compelling as those objections might appear, it is easy to overlook the fact that Pascal was well aware of them, and actually raised such worries himself.  Notably, he does not treat choosing to believe in God as a discrete event, but as a process that unfolds throughout one's life.  Thus, Pascal offers advice for those who struggle with their inability to believe….  In this way, Pascal implies that by practicing religion and engaging in its rituals one may eventually grow to develop real faith, a phenomenon that he suggests is valuable in its own right because it gives one's life meaning and purpose.  As such, Pascal's Wager need not be seen as either cynical or impossible, but as an attempt to open a genuine path to theism. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, Pascal ""does not treat choosing to believe in God as a discrete event, but as a process that unfolds throughout one's life.""  Specifically, Pascal suggests that although someone may not believe in God at a particular moment, he or she may come to do so over time: ""[B]y practicing religion and engaging in its rituals one may eventually grow to develop real faith.""  Thus, Pascal implies that a person can potentially change the way he or she thinks or feels about a subject by living life in a particular way.
Therefore, this description is most similar to the scenario in which the woman accepts a man's marriage proposal even though she is unsure of her feelings, hoping that over time she will fall in love with her fiancé.  The woman is unsure of her feelings, but hopes that by living a married life she will truly fall in love with her fiancé over time.  Similarly, Pascal suggests that one who is unsure whether she believes in God may hope to develop genuine belief by living a religious life.
  By contrast, each of the following scenarios describes a change to an external situation, not a change to the woman's own feelings:
The woman chooses a college major even though she is unsure her parents will approve, hoping that over time they will support her decision (Choice B).  In this situation, the woman is hoping that her parents' feelings toward her major will change over time, not her own feelings.
The woman auditions for parts in movies even though she is unsure she will be cast, hoping that over time she will land a breakout role (Choice C).  This description does not suggest that the woman's feelings toward acting will change, but rather that over time her auditions will be more successful.
The woman sticks with a new job even though she is unsure she enjoys it, hoping that over time it will turn into a stable career (Choice D).  This scenario does not describe the woman as hoping that her feelings toward the job will change, but rather as hoping that the job itself will change by turning into a stable career."
"162","Suppose it were discovered that Pascal himself did not come to believe in God by following his Wager, but instead believed due to a prior, personal religious experience.  How would this information affect the author's claims in the passage?","C","29","In this way, Pascal implies that by practicing religion and engaging in its rituals one may eventually grow to develop real faith, a phenomenon that he suggests is valuable in its own right because it gives one's life meaning and purpose.  As such, Pascal's Wager need not be seen as either cynical or impossible, but as an attempt to open a genuine path to theism. (Paragraph 3)
In Paragraph 3, the author describes Pascal's view that ""by practicing religion and engaging in its rituals one may eventually grow to develop real faith, a phenomenon that he suggests is valuable in its own right because it gives one's life meaning and purpose.""  Similarly, if Pascal had a personal religious experience that led him to believe in God, this would strongly suggest that he viewed this experience of coming to believe in God as providing meaning and purpose to his life.  Therefore, this information would support the claim that Pascal saw believing in God as valuable in its own right.
  (Choice A)  It would support the claim that Pascal was well aware of the objections to his argument.  Paragraph 2 mentions ""several objections"" to Pascal's Wager.  Paragraph 3 then states: ""[A]s compelling as those objections might appear, it is easy to overlook the fact that Pascal was well aware of them, and actually raised such worries himself.""  However, whether Pascal believed in God or had a personal religious experience is irrelevant to the claim that he was aware of objections to his argument; he could have been aware of those objections whether or not he had such an experience.
(Choice B)  It would challenge the claim that Pascal thought choosing to believe in God is the only rational decision.  According to Pascal's Wager, ""choosing to believe in God is the only rational decision to make in terms of one's own self-interest"" (Paragraph 1).  This conclusion is based on the idea that even if one doesn't know whether God exists, one is better off believing in God than not believing in God because that is the only option that could possibly lead to ""eternal happiness in the afterlife.""  Therefore, if Pascal had a personal religious experience that led him to believe God does exist, this point about self-interest would only be reinforced; in that case, he would have all the more reason to think that choosing to believe in God is the only rational decision to make.
(Choice D)  It would challenge the claim that Pascal's Wager is essentially a risk/reward analysis.  According to Paragraph 1, ""Pascal's Wager, then, is essentially a risk/reward analysis.  Believing in God involves a finite loss but may result in an infinite gain, whereas not believing in God risks an infinite loss for the sake of a finite gain.""  However, the nature of this analysis would not be changed or challenged if Pascal believed in God due to a personal religious experience.  Regardless of Pascal's beliefs, the point of the Wager is that any person could consider the potential gains and losses it describes."
"163","Suppose that new government regulations require the elimination of financial compensation for egg donors.  How would this affect the author's claims about concerns facing the oocyte market?","C","30","Because of these issues, bioethicists have called for the establishment of a global register of egg donors and longitudinal follow-ups that aim to identify potential negative side effects.  But even if this were implemented, other ethical concerns would loom heavy.  For instance, there is the question of why, or on what grounds, fertility clinics pay donors thousands of dollars for eggs in the first place.  Donors of other sorts are not compensated for the goods they donate, so why should egg donors be so fortunate?…Critics claim that this aspect of the industry is revealing: In compensating donors, they say, the egg procurement industry transforms women's bodies into an economic resource, mere organisms from which a supply of biological matter must be ""harvested"" for the ultimate gain of others. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, ""bioethicists have called for the establishment of a global register of egg donors and longitudinal follow-ups that aim to identify potential negative side effects.""  However, the author notes that ""even if this were implemented, other ethical concerns would loom heavy.  For instance, there is the question of why, or on what grounds, fertility clinics pay donors thousands of dollars for eggs in the first place.""  The author further describes the criticism that by compensating egg donors ""the egg procurement industry transforms women's bodies into an economic resource…for the ultimate gain of others.""
Consequently, the ""other ethical concerns"" mentioned by the author (Paragraph 4) all relate to the fact that egg donors receive financial compensation.  If new government regulations required the elimination of that compensation, then those ethical concerns would no longer arise.  Therefore, such regulations would weaken the claim that ethical issues would remain even if a global register of egg donors were established.
 (Choice A)  It would support the claim that there is little research on the long-term risks and effects of egg donation on women's health.  Paragraph 3 states that ""there is very little research on the long-term risks and effects of egg donation on women's health.""  However, the issue of whether it should be legal to ""pay donors thousands of dollars for eggs"" is part of ""other ethical concerns [that] would loom heavy"" even if there were more information about the health effects of egg donation (Paragraph 4).  Hence, government regulations eliminating financial compensation for egg donation would not necessarily support (or challenge) the claim that there is little research on the long-term risks and effects of egg donation on women's health.
(Choice B)  It would support the claim that government regulations would make women vulnerable to exploitation.  Paragraph 3 states that ""without regulations governing the commercialization of the oocyte industry…women in need of short-term financial gain become especially vulnerable to exploitative or coercive business practices.""  Accordingly, the author claims that government regulations would serve to prevent exploitation and coercion, not make women vulnerable to them.
(Choice D)  It would weaken the claim that the global demand for egg donors continues to increase.  According to Paragraph 1, ""[a]s the clientele of fertility clinics—primarily women seeking to conceive through the aid of medical intervention and reproductive technology—continues to grow, so does the immense global demand for egg donors.""  Whether egg donors are financially compensated is irrelevant to whether there is a demand for egg donation (ie, whether women seek medical intervention in order to conceive).  Therefore, new government regulations that eliminated financial compensation for egg donors would not weaken the claim that the global demand for egg donors continues to increase."
"164","Based on passage information, which of the following claims about egg donation could most easily be challenged by contradictory evidence?","C","30","For instance, there is the question of why, or on what grounds, fertility clinics pay donors thousands of dollars for eggs in the first place.  Donors of other sorts are not compensated for the goods they donate, so why should egg donors be so fortunate? (Paragraph 4)
In response to this criticism, advocates for the oocyte market claim that, unlike donations of other sorts, the egg donation process requires a medically invasive and time-consuming procedure.  Their position is that the thousands of dollars given to donors merely serves as compensation for the valuable time (not the eggs) lost during the donation process. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, ""advocates for the oocyte market claim that, unlike donations of other sorts, the egg donation process requires a medically invasive and time-consuming procedure.  Their position is that the thousands of dollars given to donors merely serves as compensation for the valuable time (not the eggs) lost during the donation process.""  This claim depends upon the idea that other types of donation are not medically invasive or time-consuming.
Consequently, the only evidence necessary to falsify such a claim would be an example of another type of donation that is medically invasive and time-consuming, but for which people are not paid.  For instance, organ donations involve invasive surgery and could potentially require extensive hospital stays; thus, such a donation would clearly challenge the distinction being drawn by advocates of the oocyte industry to justify their position.  Therefore, the statement other sorts of donations are not medically invasive or time-consuming could most easily be challenged by contradictory evidence.
 (Choice A)  ""Informed consent"" may not always be part of the egg donation process.  Paragraph 3 states that ""it is unclear that 'informed consent' is part of the [egg] donation process.""  To challenge this claim, it would be necessary to demonstrate that egg donors typically do act with informed consent.  However, ""[i]n today's unregulated marketplace, fertility clinics are not required to warn would-be donors about the potential health risks or the inadequate body of knowledge we currently have about these risks.""  Therefore, it would be difficult to establish that informed consent is always part of the egg donation process.
(Choice B)  The oocyte industry compensates donors for their time, not their eggs.  Paragraph 4 discusses ""the question of why, or on what grounds, fertility clinics pay donors thousands of dollars for eggs.""  This question assumes that egg donors are paid for the eggs they donate, not for their time.  However, the oocyte industry's position is that egg donors are paid ""for their valuable time (not the eggs)"" (Paragraph 5).  Resolving this difference in position would likely require a conceptual debate regarding the definition of selling, if not a legal judgment about sales practices.  Therefore, it would be difficult to contradict the claim that egg donors are paid for their time rather than for their eggs.
(Choice D)  The oocyte industry will continue to exist in the years to come.  Paragraph 6 states that ""it seems…the oocyte industry is here to stay.""  Since this is a claim about the future, it would be difficult to provide currently existing contradictory evidence to challenge it."
"165","Why does the author stress the fact that ""an egg is a nonrecyclable sex cell"" (Paragraph 4)?","A","30","...[T]here is the question of why, or on what grounds, fertility clinics pay donors thousands of dollars for eggs in the first place.  Donors of other sorts are not compensated for the goods they donate, so why should egg donors be so fortunate?  It is relevant to note that, by definition, an egg is a nonrecyclable sex cell; women are born with a fixed number of these and this number drastically decreases with age.  Critics claim that this aspect of the industry is revealing: In compensating donors, they say, the egg procurement industry transforms women's bodies into an economic resource, mere organisms from which a supply of biological matter must be ""harvested"" for the ultimate gain of others. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 states that the definition of an egg is ""relevant"" to the question of why egg donors are paid, because ""an egg is a nonrecyclable sex cell; women are born with a fixed number of these and this number drastically decreases with age.""  In other words, eggs have economic value because they are a limited commodity; each woman has only a certain number, which decreases over time and can never be replenished.
Accordingly, the author stresses the ""revealing"" fact that ""an egg is a nonrecyclable sex cell"" because it illustrates why critics think ""the egg procurement industry transforms women's bodies into an economic resource"" (ie, eggs for cash) (Paragraph 4).
 (Choice B)  To acquaint readers with anatomical terminology related to egg donation procedures.  The definition of an egg includes anatomical or biological terms; however, the author indicates that the definition is ""relevant"" to the ethical question of why egg donors are compensated (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, the definition is not used in order to acquaint readers with anatomical terminology.
(Choice C)  To highlight the consequences to the donor's body of repeated donations.  Although the definition of an egg implies that there will be certain consequences for women who repeatedly donate their eggs (ie, the depletion of their ""fixed number"" of eggs), the author states that the definition is ""relevant"" to the question of why ""fertility clinics pay…for eggs in the first place"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, the definition does not serve to highlight consequences of repeated donations to a donor's body.
(Choice D)  To emphasize the sentimental value attached to a resource that is scarce.  By defining an egg, the author suggests that eggs have economic value as a scarce resource (ie, because they are ""fixed"" in number).  However, the author never suggests that eggs have sentimental value (ie, that people are emotionally attached to eggs)."
"166","Based on the passage, there is an implicit assumption that:","C","30","...[A]dvocates for the oocyte market claim that…the thousands of dollars given to donors merely serves as compensation for the valuable time (not the eggs) lost during the donation process. (Paragraph 5)
If this claim helps to alleviate the concern that the oocyte industry commodifies women's bodies, there will be room for a collaborative effort toward long-term progress.  The proponents of this industry, as well as its opponents, can work together to ensure that government regulations provide safeguards against issues of consent and exploitation. (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 5, oocyte market advocates claim that donors are compensated for their time, ""not their eggs.""  Paragraph 6 states that if this claim helps alleviate the ethical concern about commodifying women's bodies, ""a collaborative effort"" between advocates for the oocyte industry and its opponents (ie, bioethicists) would be possible.
This proposed effort is further explained as one in which advocates and opponents ""work together to ensure that government regulations provide safeguards against issues of consent and exploitation"" (Paragraph 6).  Therefore, the passage assumes that advocates of the oocyte market could agree with bioethicists about the need for government regulation.
 (Choice A)  most of the high-quality eggs available in today's market are provided by female college students.  According to Paragraph 1, ""today's market [has] considerably fewer donors than needed to supply clinics with high-quality eggs.""  Paragraph 2 then states that ""a disproportionate number of female college students are donating their eggs.""  However, the fact that female college students are over-represented among egg donors does not in itself mean that the majority of high-quality eggs come from college students.  Rather, it implies only that more eggs (of whatever quality) are donated by college students than would be expected from a random distribution of donors.
(Choice B)  there is no way to alleviate the concern that the oocyte industry commodifies women's bodies.  The author says that ""there will be room for a collaborative effort"" between opponents and proponents of the oocyte industry if ""the concern that the oocyte industry commodifies women's bodies"" can be alleviated or resolved (Paragraph 6).  Accordingly, the author implies that this concern could be alleviated.
(Choice D)  a collaborative effort toward ethical or moral progress would be undesirable.  Paragraph 6 claims that ""a collaborative effort toward long-term [ethical or moral] progress…would certainly be desirable,"" not undesirable."
"167","Based on information in the passage, bioethicists would NOT agree with which of the following statements?","B","30","Some bioethicists are particularly worried about the current lack of government oversight in the oocyte market…Notice that, at present, there is very little research on the long-term risks and effects of egg donation on women's health.  In today's unregulated marketplace, fertility clinics are not required to warn would-be donors about the potential health risks or the inadequate body of knowledge we currently have about these risks.  In the absence of such information, it is unclear that ""informed consent"" is part of the donation process. (Paragraph 3)
Because of these issues, bioethicists have called for the establishment of a global register of egg donors and longitudinal follow-ups that aim to identify potential negative side effects. (Paragraph 4)
According to the passage, bioethicists worry about ""the long-term risks and effects of egg donation on women's health,"" especially because ""it is unclear that 'informed consent' is part of the [egg] donation process"" (Paragraph 3).  To address these concerns, bioethicists ""have called for the establishment of a global register of egg donors"" as well as ""follow-ups that aim to identify potential negative side effects"" of egg donation.  Therefore, this information indicates that bioethicists favor increased access to information about egg donation procedures.  Consequently, they would not agree that the government should reduce access to data collected by fertility clinics.
 (Choice A)  The government should reduce subsidies to health care providers.  Although bioethicists would presumably have a general interest in health care, the passage contains no information about health care providers or government subsidies of them.
(Choice C)  Lawmakers should impose regulations on student loan programs.  The passage states that ""a disproportionate number of female college students are donating their eggs"" and suggests this may be due to ""recent hikes in tuition"" (Paragraph 2).  However, the passage never mentions student loan programs nor indicates that bioethicists in particular have beliefs about how such programs should be regulated.
(Choice D)  Lawmakers should impose regulations on reproductive technology.  The author states that ""bioethicists are particularly worried about the current lack of government oversight in the oocyte market"" (Paragraph 3).  Accordingly, bioethicists would likely agree that lawmakers should impose regulations on reproductive technology, providing the oversight they believe is lacking."
"168","If subsequent research revealed that there are no long-term health risks of egg donation, this would most directly address the ethical concern that:","D","30","This raises certain moral or ethical concerns, however…Notice that, at present, there is very little research on the long-term risks and effects of egg donation on women's health…In the absence of such information, it is unclear that ""informed consent"" is part of the donation process. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 states that because ""there is very little research on the long-term"" health risks of egg donation, ""it is unclear that 'informed consent' is part of the donation process.""  Research revealing that there are no long-term health risks of egg donation would directly address this ethical concern, as it would allow women to donate their eggs on the basis of sufficient information about the impact of egg donation on women's health.
 (Choices A and B)  women donate eggs for the ultimate gain of others; and the egg procurement industry transforms women's bodies into an economic resource.  Paragraph 4 implies that, because ""the egg procurement industry transforms women's bodies into an economic resource,"" women's eggs are donated or ""'harvested' for the ultimate gain of others.""  Research showing that egg donation has no health risks would not address these aspects of the industry, since such ""ethical concerns would loom heavy"" (ie, remain unaddressed) whether or not ""potential negative side effects (ie, health risks)"" of egg donation are identified (Paragraph 4).
(Choice C)  it is not apparent that consent is part of the egg donation process for some women.  Paragraph 3 discusses the ethical concern that ""women in need of short-term financial gain become especially vulnerable to exploitative or coercive business practices"" surrounding egg donation.  The author elaborates that ""for impoverished women—because financial hardship leaves them with so few options--it is not even apparent that consent is part of the (egg donation) process.""  Accordingly, this concern involves the possibility that some women may be exploited for their eggs due to financial desperation.  Therefore, the discovery that egg donation has no long-term health risks would not help to address this issue, as women could still feel forced to donate their eggs out of the need for financial gain."
"169","Based on the passage, one can most reasonably infer that the discovery of the scrolls was of great significance because it:","C","31","The manuscripts demonstrate a remarkable consistency with the Masoretic or medieval Hebrew text used for many English translations of the Bible, notably the King James version.  Thus, the scrolls, which predate the Masoretic text by about 1,000 years, largely substantiate its reliability and authoritative status. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 states that the Dead Sea Scrolls ""demonstrate a remarkable consistency with the Masoretic or medieval Hebrew text used for many English translations of the Bible, notably the King James Version.  Thus, the scrolls, which predate the Masoretic text by about 1,000 years, largely substantiate its reliability and authoritative status.""  In other words, because of their age, the Dead Sea Scrolls can serve as the standard against which the Masoretic text can be compared and judged for accuracy.  Therefore, one can most reasonably infer that their discovery was of great significance because it provided specific evidence of biblical authenticity.
 (Choice A)  changed which books are included in the biblical canon.  Paragraph 3 states that ""[t]he more than 900 identified manuscripts include parts of every book in the Old Testament canon (ie, collection of sacred texts recognized as genuine) except the Book of Esther"" and that ""[o]ther scrolls contain noncanonical texts.""  However, the passage never suggests that the discovery of the scrolls, which comprise both canonical and noncanonical manuscripts, changed which books are included in the biblical canon.
(Choice B)  showed that multiple copies exist of some biblical texts.  Paragraph 3 states that ""[t]he more than 900 identified manuscripts include parts of every book in the Old Testament canon except the Book of Esther, some with as many as 39 copies.""  However, although this information does show that multiple copies of some biblical texts exist, the passage indicates that the great significance of the scrolls lies in their age and consistency with the Masoretic text.
(Choice D)  stimulated the use of new methods of paleography.  Paragraph 1 states that ""[s]ince the 1950s, scholars have been engaged in reconstructing a multifarious (diverse) collection of ancient sacred texts…from a welter (chaotic mass) of as many as 100,000 fragments of disparate size and shape.  With some fragments no larger than a postage stamp and covered with barely decipherable writing, the formidable paleographic project presents a jigsaw puzzle of epic proportions and frustrating intricacy.""  However, despite all the difficulty involved in the reconstruction project, the passage never suggests that the discovery of the scrolls stimulated the use of any new methods of paleography (ie, the deciphering and dating of ancient manuscripts)."
"170","The analogy between the scroll reconstruction project and a jigsaw puzzle is most likely meant to illustrate that:","B","31","Since the 1950s, scholars have been engaged in reconstructing a multifarious collection of ancient sacred texts, now known as the Dead Sea Scrolls, from a welter of as many as 100,000 fragments of disparate size and shape.  With some fragments no larger than a postage stamp and covered with barely decipherable writing, the formidable paleographic project presents a jigsaw puzzle of epic proportions and frustrating intricacy. (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, ""scholars have been engaged in reconstructing a multifarious (diverse) collection of ancient sacred texts, now known as the Dead Sea Scrolls, from a welter (chaotic mass) of as many as 100,000 fragments of disparate size and shape.  With some fragments no larger than a postage stamp and covered with barely decipherable writing, the formidable paleographic (ie, pertaining to the deciphering and dating of ancient manuscripts) project presents a jigsaw puzzle of epic proportions and frustrating intricacy.""
By using a jigsaw puzzle of such imposing dimensions as the point of comparison, the analogy underscores how demanding and complicated the process of reconstructing the scrolls is.  Therefore, the analogy is most likely meant to illustrate that, like a jigsaw puzzle, the project is a difficult integrative process (ie, aimed at reconstituting a whole) of overwhelming detail.
 By contrast, the analogy between the scroll reconstruction project and a jigsaw puzzle is not likely meant to illustrate that:
like a jigsaw puzzle, the project represents an intellectual challenge of complexity and significance (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 1, ""despite the fragmentary condition of the scrolls, their discovery has turned out to be the most important religious archaeological windfall of the 20th century.""  Although the passage's analogy indicates that the jigsaw puzzle resembles the reconstructive project in its ""epic proportions"" (ie, size) and ""frustrating intricacy"" (ie, complexity), it never suggests that it is comparable in significance.
reconstructive paleographic projects are substantially more difficult than even very complicated jigsaw puzzles (Choice C).  By comparing ""the formidable paleographic project"" of reconstructing the Dead Sea Scrolls to ""a jigsaw puzzle of epic proportions and frustrating intricacy"" (Paragraph 1), the analogy serves to emphasize the difficulty of this project.  However, the analogy does not make a general comparison between the relative difficulty of reconstructive paleographic projects and intricate (ie, very complicated) jigsaw puzzles.
reconstructive projects depend on linguistic knowledge, unlike most jigsaw puzzles (Choice D).  Paragraph 1 describes the scrolls as ""covered with barely decipherable writing,"" indicating that their reconstruction is dependent upon linguistic knowledge.  However, the analogy between the reconstructive project and the jigsaw puzzle is based on similarities in size and complexity, not on whether linguistic knowledge is required to complete them."
"171","Based on passage information, which of the following reasons most likely motivated the Essenes to establish their community at Qumran?","D","31","In the first century, Pliny described the Qumran community as a monastic brotherhood that followed an ascetic lifestyle of work, prayer, and the study of sacred law and esoteric doctrine.…  The group had migrated to the desert, eschewing urban areas, as Philo reports, ""because of the ungodliness customary among the city-dwellers."" (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, the Essenes ""had migrated to the desert, eschewing (avoiding) urban areas, as Philo reports, 'because of the ungodliness customary among the city-dwellers.'""  Therefore, the passage indicates that the reason that most likely motivated the Essenes to establish their community at Qumran was its distance from urban (ie, city) immorality.
 (Choice A)  The environment it provided for studying texts.  According to Paragraph 2, Pliny ""described the Qumran community as a monastic brotherhood that followed an ascetic (self-denying) lifestyle of work, prayer, and the study of sacred law and esoteric doctrine (ie, teachings intended for or understood by only a few scholars).""  However, the passage never indicates that providing an environment for studying texts was the motivation for the Essenes to establish their community at Qumran.
(Choice B)  The hiding places it offered for the scrolls.  Paragraph 2 states that ""[t]he scrolls were found in large pottery jars hidden inside the caves that dot the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, at a site called Khirbet Qumran.""  Paragraph 3 adds that ""[i]t is likely that the Essenes stashed the scrolls in jars and placed these inside the caves when they fled the imminent destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple…by the Romans in 70 CE.""  This information conveys only that the nearby caves provided convenient hiding places at the time of the Roman invasion; the passage never indicates that the Essenes were originally motivated to establish their community at Qumran because its caves offered hiding places for the scrolls.
(Choice C)  Its nearness to the shores of the Dead Sea.  According to Paragraph 2, ""[t]he scrolls were found in large pottery jars hidden inside the caves that dot the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea, at a site called Khirbet Qumran…[where] members of a Jewish sect known as the Essenes had established a small community.""  Although this information provides a detailed description of the location of the Essenes' settlement at Qumran, it never indicates that its nearness to the shores of the Dead Sea was likely the reason that motivated the Essenes to establish their community there."
"172","The description of the Essenes would be most challenged if which of the following assertions were true?","B","31","In the first century, Pliny described the Qumran community as a monastic brotherhood that followed an ascetic lifestyle of work, prayer, and the study of sacred law and esoteric doctrine.  The Essenes differed from the mainstream Jewish community in objecting to animal sacrifices and subscribing to the heretical dictum that fate is ""the mistress of all."" (Paragraph 2)
In Paragraph 2, Pliny states that ""the Essenes differed from the mainstream Jewish community in objecting to animal sacrifices and subscribing to the heretical dictum (ie, pronouncement opposed to official teachings) that fate is 'the mistress of all'"" (ie, the dominating and controlling force of existence).  Accordingly, this information reveals that the Essenes engaged in beliefs and practices that diverged from (ie, went in a different direction from) mainstream or conventional Jewish teachings.  Consequently, if it were true that the Essenes rejected practices that diverged from conventional Judaism, this assertion would most challenge the description of the Essenes.
 By contrast, none of the following assertions, if true, would challenge the description of the Essenes:
They disputed the necessity of certain sacrifices (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 2, ""[t]he Essenes differed from the mainstream Jewish community in objecting to animal sacrifices.""
They dedicated a significant amount of time to interpreting religious texts (Choice C).  Paragraph 2 states that ""Pliny described the Qumran community as a monastic brotherhood that followed an ascetic (self-denying) lifestyle of work, prayer, and the study of sacred law and esoteric doctrine (ie, teachings intended for or understood by only a few scholars).""  Therefore, the Essenes would likely have dedicated a significant amount of time to interpreting religious (ie, sacred) texts.
Their members refused to abandon a belief in fate (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 2, ""[t]he Essenes differed from the mainstream Jewish community in…subscribing to the heretical dictum that fate is 'the mistress of all.'""  In other words, the Essenes were not likely to give up their unorthodox or unconventional belief in fate as supreme."
"173","The author's mention of the term ""linguistic currency"" (Paragraph 4) to refer to the use of Aramaic most directly applies to this language's:","C","31","Over 75% of the parchment and papyrus scrolls are written in Hebrew; most of the others are in Aramaic (a related language that had become the standard linguistic currency in the Near East), while a smaller portion are inscribed in ancient Greek. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, Aramaic was a language ""related"" to Hebrew that ""had become the standard linguistic currency in the Near East.""  The term ""currency"" refers to a medium of exchange (usually monetary exchange); therefore, ""linguistic currency"" would indicate a medium of verbal exchange.  Accordingly, the passage suggests that culturally diverse groups of people in the Near East at that time would most likely have communicated with each other in Aramaic, not Hebrew or ancient Greek.
Therefore, the author's mention of the term ""linguistic currency"" to refer to the use of Aramaic most directly applies to this language's flexibility as a shared tongue (ie, common language) for communication with different peoples.
 By contrast, the author's mention of the term ""linguistic currency"" to refer to the use of Aramaic does not apply to this language's:
abundant religious terms and expressions (Choice A).  Paragraph 4 states that some of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which are primarily religious texts, ""are in Aramaic.""  However, the passage never discusses the vocabulary of Aramaic nor suggests that it was particularly rich in religious terms and expressions.
particular grammatical structure (Choice B).  Although Paragraph 4 states that the Aramaic language is ""related"" to Hebrew, the passage provides no information regarding the grammar of either Aramaic or Hebrew.
linguistic similarity to Hebrew and Ancient Greek (Choice D).  Although Paragraph 4 indicates that the Aramaic language is ""related"" to Hebrew, the passage never states that it is related or similar to ancient Greek."
"174","Given the information presented in Paragraph 5, it can most reasonably be concluded that prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls:","A","31","The manuscripts demonstrate remarkable consistency with the Masoretic or medieval Hebrew text used for many English translations of the Bible, notably the King James Version.  Thus, the scrolls, which predate the Masoretic text by about 1,000 years, largely substantiate its reliability and authoritative status.  They also offer a window onto a critical period in Judeo-Christian culture; in particular, they confirm the religious diversity of the time and the similarity of an eschatological, messianic Jewish sect of the first century to early Christian communities. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 states that ""[t]he manuscripts demonstrate a remarkable consistency with the Masoretic or medieval Hebrew text used for many English translations of the Bible, notably the King James Version.  Thus, the scrolls, which predate the Masoretic text by about 1,000 years, largely substantiate its reliability and authoritative status.""  Accordingly, this information implies that the discovery of the scrolls was significant mainly because, as the scrolls are older than the Masoretic text, they could provide a point of comparison for judging the accuracy of its content.
Therefore, given the information presented in Paragraph 5, it can most reasonably be concluded that prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls there was no evidence available to adequately verify the content of the Masoretic text.
 (Choice B)  there was no research method in place to ensure the linguistic accuracy of biblical translations.  Paragraph 5 explains that ""the Masoretic or medieval Hebrew text"" was ""used for many English translations of the Bible, notably the King James Version.""  This fact indicates that biblical translations could have been compared to the Masoretic text as a way to judge the accuracy of their language.  Therefore, there was a research method in place to ensure the linguistic accuracy of biblical translations prior to the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
(Choices C and D)  there were no attempts to research the various religious sects of the Second Temple Period; and there was no substantive research providing information about any messianic Jewish sects.  Paragraph 5 says that the scrolls ""confirm the religious diversity of the time, and the similarity of an eschatological, messianic (ie, characterized by concerns with the final destiny of mankind and a belief in a messiah) Jewish sect of the first century to early Christian communities.""  The use of the word ""confirm"" indicates that some research already existed on the various religious sects of this time period, including at least one messianic Jewish sect, to which the discovery of the scrolls then lent support."
"175","Based on the passage, the most probable reason why the Book of Esther is not found among the Dead Sea Scrolls would be that:","D","31","[S]cholars have been engaged in reconstructing a multifarious collection of ancient sacred texts, now known as the Dead Sea Scrolls, from a welter of as many as 100,000 fragments of disparate size and shape. (Paragraph 1)
It is likely that the Essenes stashed the scrolls in jars and placed these inside the caves when they fled the imminent destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple (Herod's Temple) by the Romans in 70 CE.  The more than 900 identified manuscripts include parts of every book in the Old Testament canon except the Book of Esther, some with as many as 39 copies.  Only one scroll, the Great Isaiah Scroll, offers a virtually intact book: its 24 feet of parchment features all 66 chapters of the Book of Isaiah.  Other scrolls contain noncanonical texts…. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 1, ""scholars have been engaged in reconstructing a multifarious (diverse) collection of ancient sacred texts, now known as the Dead Sea Scrolls, from…as many as 100,000 fragments.""  Paragraph 3 then describes how ""the more than 900 identified manuscripts include parts of every book in the Old Testament canon (ie, the collection of sacred texts recognized as genuine) except the Book of Esther,"" though ""only one scroll…offers a virtually intact book.""  Therefore, many manuscripts were at least partially destroyed.
Furthermore, Paragraph 3 conveys that ""[i]t is likely that the Essenes stashed the scrolls…when they fled the imminent destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple.""  Accordingly, some scrolls could have been lost during the chaotic evacuation.  Therefore, the most probable reason why the Book of Esther is not found among the Dead Sea Scrolls is that many of the Essenes' texts were lost or destroyed since the time of the community's flourishing.
 (Choice A)  the Essenes neglected to preserve certain texts such as the Book of Esther.  According to Paragraph 1, the Dead Sea Scrolls constitute ""as many as 100,000 fragments of disparate size and shape.""  Among these fragments, ""only the Great Isaiah Scroll offers a virtually intact book"" (Paragraph 3).  As Paragraph 2 explains, ""It is likely that the Essenes stashed the scrolls in jars and placed these inside the caves when they fled the imminent destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple.""  Thus, although the Essenes had desperately attempted to preserve their library, many texts still ended up damaged or destroyed.  The passage never suggests that whether a certain text ended up preserved was anything but random.
(Choice B)  the Essenes were opposed to including the Book of Esther in the biblical canon.  Paragraph 3 states that ""[t]he more than 900 identified manuscripts include parts of every book in the Old Testament canon except the Book of Esther"" and that ""[o]ther scrolls contain noncanonical texts.""  However, this information conveys only that the Book of Esther was not found among the scrolls; it does not link its absence to canonical status or suggest that the Essenes were opposed to including it in the biblical canon.
(Choice C)  many in the Essene brotherhood did not acknowledge the book's authority because it was centered on a woman.  According to Paragraph 2, ""[i]n the first century, Pliny described the Qumran community as a monastic brotherhood that followed an ascetic (self-denying) lifestyle of work, prayer, and the study of sacred law and esoteric doctrine (ie, teachings understandable to only a few scholars).""  This information indicates that the Qumran community was exclusively male, but never suggests that members refused to acknowledge the Book of Esther's authority because it was centered on a woman."
"176","The use of the term ""unreliable narrator"" in Paragraph 1 implies that such a narrator:","C","32","Moreover, in her most innovative detective novel to date, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Christie had conjured a narrator so unreliable he elides the details of the incident most crucial to identifying the murderer, only to later reveal himself as the perpetrator.  Similarly, the events about to unfold would possess all the makings of a classic Christie whodunnit.  They form a conspicuous lacuna in the writer's autobiography, rendering her the unreliable narrator of her own life story. (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, ""[I]n her most innovative detective novel to date…Christie had conjured a narrator so unreliable he elides (omits) the details of the incident most crucial to identifying the murderer, only to later reveal himself as the perpetrator (ie, the one who committed the crime).""  Paragraph 1 then ascribes the same kind of behavior to Christie herself as ""the events about to unfold would possess all the makings of a classic Christie whodunnit...[and] form a conspicuous lacuna (gap) in the writer's autobiography, rendering her the unreliable narrator of her own life story.""
Accordingly, the passage indicates that both the narrator of Christie's novel and Christie as the narrator of her autobiography intentionally omit crucial details of their stories.  Therefore, the passage author's use of the term ""unreliable narrator"" in Paragraph 1 implies that such a narrator is selective about details (ie, purposefully choosing to leave certain ones out) when relating his or her story.
 (Choices A and D)  offers only false assurances to an unsuspecting audience; and inadvertently covers up facts that are crucial to the narrative.  Paragraph 1 indicates that the narrator of Christie's innovative novel ""elides the details of the incident most crucial to identifying the murderer, only to later reveal himself as the perpetrator.""  Furthermore, Paragraph 1 conveys that the story of Christie's disappearance ""would form a conspicuous lacuna in the writer's autobiography.""  Therefore, the passage author implies that an unreliable narrator covers up important facts intentionally rather than inadvertently (unintentionally) or just omits highly pertinent information.  Moreover, as even a narrator who covers up or omits facts could be supposed to provide some true information, the passage author's use of the term ""unreliable narrator"" does not imply that such a narrator offers only false assurances.
(Choice B)  is trustworthy only about facts that cast him or her in a favorable light.  According to Paragraph 1, in ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Christie had conjured a narrator so unreliable he elides the details of the incident most crucial to identifying the murderer, only to later reveal himself as the perpetrator.""  Paragraph 1 also indicates that Christie herself was an unreliable narrator who allowed her mysterious disappearance to ""form a conspicuous lacuna in [her] autobiography.""  Hence, the passage author depicts an ""unreliable narrator"" as someone who deliberately tries to hide details that might reflect unfavorably on him or her.  However, the evidence does not support the claim that this narrator can be trusted only when the facts place him or her in a favorable light and not, for instance, when facts reflect neither positively nor negatively."
"177","Why does the passage author most likely refer to the character of Ariadne Oliver (Paragraph 1)?","A","32","What would transpire was a real-life mystery not beyond the imaginative pale of this well-known writer named Agatha Christie—an author who…presents a carefully constructed world of ""strychnine and crumpets"" where murder and mayhem are served up with ""post-Wildean wit.""  Into this made-up world, Agatha would later inscribe herself as a recurring character, the quirky crime fiction writer Ariadne Oliver. (Paragraph 1)
Days later, Christie was spotted at the Harrogate Hydro, an exclusive spa hotel located hours north of London….  Even more intriguingly, in Christie's short story ""The Case of the Missing Lady,"" the protagonist turns up at a health spa after being thought the victim of a plot. (Paragraph 4)
Although temporary amnesia remained the official explanation for the author's mysterious eleven-day disappearance, her autobiography…omits the notorious episode entirely….  Later insights suggest that the detective fiction writer—like her character Jane Finn, who wiles a marriage proposal from a suitor after feigning amnesia—masterminded the whole escapade to recapture her husband's attention.  Hence, the disappearing act of Agatha Christie may have been a less-than-mysterious case of life imitating art. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 1, Christie's fiction ""presents a carefully constructed world of 'strychnine and crumpets' where murder and mayhem are served up with 'post-Wildean wit.'""  Paragraph 1 also states that ""[i]nto this made-up world, Agatha would later inscribe herself as a recurring character, the quirky crime fiction writer Ariadne Oliver.""  Consequently, Christie closely identified with Oliver, thereby setting herself up as an integral part of her own fictional world.
Paragraph 4 further speculates about author-character identification, revealing how a few days after her disappearance, ""Christie was spotted at the Harrogate Hydro, an exclusive spa hotel,"" while in her short story ""The Case of the Missing Lady,"" ""the protagonist turns up at a health spa after being thought the victim of a plot.""  Finally, in Paragraph 5, the passage author explicitly states that ""[l]ater insights suggest that the detective fiction writer—like her character Jane Finn, who wiles a marriage proposal from a suitor after feigning amnesia—masterminded the whole escapade to recapture her husband's attention.""
Therefore, the Ariadne Oliver reference seems to foreshadow how the missing Christie would adopt the behavior of her fictional characters, in effect enacting her own plot twists.  Accordingly, the passage author most likely refers to the character of Ariadne Oliver (Paragraph 1) to anticipate Christie's apparent descent into an imaginary world.
 By contrast, the passage author does not refer to the character of Ariadne Oliver to:
demonstrate that characters in Christie novels are modeled on real people (Choice B).  Paragraph 1 states that Christie ""would later inscribe herself"" into her work ""as a recurring character, the quirky fiction writer Ariadne Oliver.""  Furthermore, the passage author provides no evidence that any of Christie's other characters—for example, Hercule Poirot—are modeled on real people.
emphasize Christie's self-centered need for attention as a writer (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 1, Christie ""would later inscribe herself"" into her own fictional world ""as a recurring character, the quirky crime fiction writer Ariadne Oliver.""  Subsequently, Paragraph 4 notes that the missing Christie reappears at the Harrogate Hydro, not unlike her suspiciously missing character who ""turns up at a health spa.""  Similarly, Paragraph 5 suggests that, like another of her characters, the writer may have ""feign[ed] amnesia"" to ""recapture her husband's attention.""  Therefore, evidence indicates that the passage author refers to Oliver to highlight Christie's apparent tendency to merge her life and her art rather than to emphasize some self-centered need for attention that Christie may have harbored as a writer.
show that a good mystery novel's characters are as important as its plot (Choice D).  By mentioning ""a recurring character, the quirky crime fiction writer Ariadne Oliver,"" the passage author suggests that creating such a character is significant to Christie's craft of crime fiction.  However, the passage author never implies anything regarding the importance of characters relative to the importance of the plot in a good mystery novel."
"178","Paragraph 3 suggests ""other people"" speculated that:","D","32","Police suspected foul play and could not rule out suicide.  Rumors swirled that distress at her mother's passing combined with her husband's infidelity had caused Agatha's life to unravel, leading her to seek revenge.  Other people were unconvinced, pointing out that notoriety from the author's disappearance would likely boost sales of her new book. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, ""Rumors swirled that distress at her mother's passing combined with her husband's infidelity had caused Agatha's life to unravel, leading her to seek revenge.""  Furthermore, Paragraph 3 conveys that ""[o]ther people were unconvinced, pointing out that notoriety from the author's disappearance would likely boost sales of her new book.""  In other words, there were people who thought that Christie might have staged her own disappearance because she knew the situation would generate publicity and sympathy, and so likely increase sales and revenue from her latest crime novel.  Consequently, according to Paragraph 3, other people speculated that Agatha Christie manipulated circumstances for the sake of personal gain.
 By contrast, Paragraph 3 does not suggest other people speculated that:
Christie disappeared due to fear of a plot against her (Choice A).  As Paragraph 3 states, ""Police suspected foul play and could not rule out suicide.""  This information implies that the police pondered whether some form of criminal activity might have factored into Christie's disappearance.  However, the paragraph never indicates that anyone speculated that Christie disappeared because she herself feared a plot.
Christie had little reason to seek attention by disappearing (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 3, ""Rumors swirled that distress at her mother's passing combined with her husband's infidelity had caused Agatha's life to unravel, leading her to seek revenge.""  Despite these rumors, ""[o]ther people were unconvinced, pointing out that notoriety from the author's disappearance would likely boost sales of her new book.""  Consequently, the passage implies that there were people who speculated that Christie had definite reasons for seeking attention through her disappearance.
Christie exaggerated domestic woes to garner public sympathy (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 3, ""Rumors swirled that distress at her mother's passing combined with her husband's infidelity had caused Agatha's life to unravel, leading her to seek revenge.""  Therefore, the passage suggests that Christie experienced genuine personal problems that, people speculated, motivated her disappearance.  However, Paragraph 3 does not suggest that anyone thought that Christie was exaggerating domestic woes, whether for public sympathy or other reasons."
"179","The author's mention of the title ""The Case of the Missing Lady"" (Paragraph 4) serves to:","B","32","Police suspected foul play and could not rule out suicide. (Paragraph 3)
Days later, Christie was spotted at the Harrogate Hydro, an exclusive spa hotel located hours north of London.  Registering under the surname of her husband's mistress, she availed herself of the amenities and fraternized with guests.  Purportedly, the celebrated crime writer also perused the newspapers without the slightest recognition of herself on the front page—a scenario not altogether improbable if she was suffering from a dissociative fugue state or stress-induced amnesia.  Even more intriguingly, in Christie's short story ""The Case of the Missing Lady,"" the protagonist turns up at a health spa after being thought the victim of a plot. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 3, ""[p]olice suspected foul play"" in Christie's disappearance.  Paragraph 4 then reveals that ""Christie was spotted at the Harrogate Hydro, an exclusive spa hotel"" where she ""availed herself of the amenities (pleasurable resources) and fraternized (socialized) with guests.""  The by now well-known Christie was able to read ""the newspapers without the slightest recognition of herself on the front page,"" possibly because she ""was suffering from a dissociative fugue state or stress-induced amnesia.""  The passage author then points out an intriguing parallel: ""in Christie's short story 'The Case of the Missing Lady,' the protagonist turns up at a health spa after being thought the victim of a plot.""
Accordingly, by mentioning the title of Christie's short story ""The Case of the Missing Lady"" in Paragraph 4, the passage author suggests parallels between the writer's real-life disappearing act and the plot of the story.  However, as neither definitive motives nor a solution to the mystery are provided, the reference serves simply to amplify (heighten) the real-life mystery of Christie's disappearance.
 By contrast, the passage author does not mention the title of Christie's story ""The Case of the Missing Lady"" to:
identify Christie's motives (Choice A).  By citing Christie's short story, the passage author suggests that the writer was enacting her own fiction in staging her real-life mystery and that, like her character, she may have been ""thought the victim of a plot.""—perhaps as Christie wanted people to believe.  However, this citation does not help to determine Christie's genuine motives for disappearing.
ridicule Christie's situation (Choice C).  Paragraph 4 conveys that ""Christie was spotted at the Harrogate Hydro, an exclusive spa hotel"" and that ""intriguingly, in Christie's short story 'The Case of the Missing Lady,' the protagonist turns up at a health spa after being thought the victim of a plot.""  Accordingly, by citing the title of the story, the passage author hints at similarities between its plot and Christie's real-life disappearance but does not ridicule (make fun of) Christie's situation.
confirm Christie's pretense (Choice D).  By mentioning the title of the short story, the passage author suggests that Christie might be mirroring the actions of her character who ""turns up at a health spa after being thought the victim of a plot"" (Paragraph 4).  However, by merely suggesting similarities between the story's plot and Christie's situation, the passage author does not confirm that the writer was, in fact, carrying out a pretense (deception) of some kind."
"180","The passage suggests which of the following about Christie's approach to crime fiction?","D","32","Moreover, in her most innovative detective novel to date…Christie had conjured a narrator so unreliable he elides the details of the incident most crucial to identifying the murderer, only to later reveal himself as the perpetrator.  Similarly, the events about to unfold would possess all the makings of a classic Christie whodunnit.

Days later, Christie was spotted at the Harrogate Hydro, an exclusive spa hotel located hours north of London….  Even more intriguingly, in Christie's short story ""The Case of the Missing Lady,"" the protagonist turns up at a health spa after being thought the victim of a plot. (Paragraph 4)
Although temporary amnesia remained the official explanation for the author's mysterious…disappearance, her autobiography…omits the notorious episode entirely….  Later insights suggest that the detective fiction writer—like her character Jane Finn, who wiles a marriage proposal from a suitor after feigning amnesia—masterminded the whole escapade to recapture her husband's attention.  Hence, the disappearing act of Agatha Christie may have been a less-than-mysterious case of life imitating art. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 1, ""[I]n her most innovative detective novel to date…Christie had conjured a narrator so unreliable he elides (omits) the details of the incident most crucial to identifying the murderer, only to later reveal himself as the perpetrator (ie, the one who committed the crime).""  As the passage further relates, the details of Christie's disappearance ""would possess all the makings of a classic Christie whodunnit… [and] form a conspicuous lacuna (gap) in the writer's autobiography, rendering her the unreliable narrator of her own life story.""
Likewise, Paragraph 4 presents a similarity between Christie's real-life situation and that of the protagonist of her short story ""The Case of the Missing Lady.""  Furthermore, Paragraph 5 compares Christie's motive for disappearing to that of ""her character Jane Finn, who wiles a marriage proposal from a suitor after feigning (faking) amnesia.""
Accordingly, the apparent similarities between Christie's disappearance and the behavior of her fictional characters suggest that the author at times allowed her crime novels and her life to overlap.  Therefore, regarding Christie's approach to crime fiction, the passage suggests that she incorporates parallels from her own life into her plots.
 By contrast, the passage does not suggest any of the following about Christie's approach to crime fiction:
She typically makes her narrators unreliable (Choice A).  Paragraph 1 explains how ""in her most innovative detective novel to date,"" The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Christie had conjured a narrator so unreliable he elides the details of the incident most crucial to identifying the murderer, only to later reveal himself as the perpetrator.""  The passage then draws a parallel with Christie's eleven-day disappearance, noting that the episode became ""a conspicuous lacuna (gap) in the writer's autobiography"" and Christie herself ""an unreliable narrator of her own life story.""  However, the passage never indicates that Christie created any other unreliable narrators.
She often relies on amnesia as a plot device (Choice B).  Paragraph 5 states that ""temporary amnesia remained the official explanation for the author's mysterious eleven-day disappearance.""  The passage then turns to Christie's fiction: ""Later insights suggest that the detective fiction writer—like her character Jane Finn, who wiles a marriage proposal from a suitor after feigning amnesia—masterminded the whole escapade to recapture her husband's attention.""  However, the passage provides no other examples of Christie characters with amnesia nor suggests that she often relied on amnesia as a plot device.
She employs well-established literary formulas (Choice C).  Paragraph 1 calls Christie's The Murder of Roger Ackroyd ""her most innovative detective novel to date,"" partly because of its unreliable narrator.  This information indicates that at least some of Christie's previous crime novels must have been innovative for her newest book to qualify as her most innovative.  By emphasizing her innovativeness, the passage suggests that in her approach to crime fiction, Christie tended to go against well-established literary formulas or conventions."
"181","The author most likely supports which of the following perspectives toward humanistic inquiry?","B","33","As with rival scientific theories, acceptance of a humanistic framework can be gained by endeavouring to encompass and surpass the insights of competing schools of thought….  ""In effect, [Neo-Confucianist Zhou Dunyi] was co-opting Daoist terminology to show that the Confucian worldview was actually more inclusive than the Daoist.""  The result, strangely enough, was a cosmology with resemblances to both Platonic rationalism and Augustinian Christianity. (Paragraph 1)
To be certain, the claim that ""each and every thing has in it the Supreme Ultimate"" is not an exact analogue to the Platonic notion that all things possess a degree of reality commensurate with how closely they resemble the Good….  Nevertheless, the similarities between the two systems of thought are provocative. (Paragraph 3)
Of course, the views do exhibit significant disparities: the Supreme Ultimate of Neo-Confucianism is not identified as a deity, and, requiring material force in which to inhere, it is still less the omnipotent, self-sufficient God of Augustine's faith.  Again, however, the parallels between the two conceptions are notable. (Paragraph 4)
Perhaps the world will one day produce a Grand Unified Theory of Humanism which encompasses all major strands of humanistic thinking—or which, at the least, will ever more closely reflect the reality they mutually seek to describe. (Paragraph 5)
The passage stresses the idea that seemingly different humanistic frameworks possess fundamental similarities, suggesting that they could be unified into a more cohesive whole.  Thus, Paragraph 1 describes humanistic frameworks as ""endeavouring to encompass and surpass the insights of competing schools of thought,"" and mentions the occasionally surprising commonalities between them.  For instance, after ""co-opting Daoist terminology,"" Neo-Confucianism became ""a cosmology (conception of how the world is ordered) with resemblances to both Platonic rationalism and Augustinian Christianity.""
The author further elaborates on these resemblances throughout the passage.  For example, Paragraph 3 asserts that although the ""'Supreme Ultimate' is not an exact analogue"" to Plato's Form of the Good, ""the similarities between the two systems of thought are provocative.""  Likewise, Paragraph 4 conveys that while Neo-Confucian and Augustinian views ""do exhibit significant disparities…the parallels between the two conceptions are notable"" in treating evil as a disharmony rather than an independent substance or force.
The author ultimately implies that such parallels may be found in ""all major strands of humanistic thinking,"" and he or she suggests that these strands might one day be incorporated into a single ""Grand Unified Theory of Humanism"" (Paragraph 5).  Thus, the passage emphasizes the process of discovering and acknowledging the underlying similarities in diverse humanistic frameworks.  Consequently, the author most likely supports a comparative perspective toward humanistic inquiry.
 By contrast, the author does not most likely support a perspective toward humanistic inquiry that is:
Evaluative (Choice A).  Although the passage highlights the similarities between certain schools of thought, it also notes some significant differences between them.  For example, Paragraph 3 states that while the Supreme Ultimate of Neo-Confucianism has some comparable elements to Plato's Forms, one idea ""is not an exact analogue"" of the other.  Likewise, Paragraph 4 conveys that the concept of the Supreme Ultimate is not equivalent to ""the omnipotent (all-powerful), self-sufficient God of Augustine's faith.""  However, the passage never takes a stance favoring one school of thought over another, nor otherwise judges these schools' respective merits.  Therefore, while the author's perspective is comparative, it is not evaluative.
Descriptive (Choice C).  Although the author does describe certain humanistic frameworks, he or she also stresses ""the similarities between the...systems of thought"" (Paragraph 3) and the notable ""parallels between the…conceptions"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, the author's perspective goes beyond mere description to focus on comparison.
Combative (Choice D).  The passage describes humanistic frameworks as ""endeavouring to encompass and surpass the insights of competing schools of thought"" (Paragraph 1).  Accordingly, the passage portrays a perspective in which one framework incorporates and expands upon another, rather than one in which a framework figuratively combats and seeks to defeat its competitors."
"182","The mention of the Neo-Confucian revival in Song dynasty China (Paragraph 1) serves which of the following functions in the passage?","D","33","As with rival scientific theories, acceptance of a humanistic framework can be gained by endeavouring to encompass and surpass the insights of competing schools of thought.  Sinologists such as DeBary and Bloom see the Neo-Confucian revival in Song dynasty China as employing such a strategy in relation to Daoism: ""In effect, [Neo-Confucianist Zhou Dunyi] was co-opting Daoist terminology to show that the Confucian worldview was actually more inclusive than the Daoist."" (Paragraph 1)
Hundreds of years and thousands of miles separate these thinkers, making all the more striking the similarities….  Perhaps the world will one day produce a Grand Unified Theory of Humanism which encompasses all major strands of humanistic thinking—or which, at the least, will ever more closely reflect the reality they mutually seek to describe. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 1 conveys that just as one scientific theory may incorporate and expand upon another, ""acceptance of a humanistic framework can be gained by endeavouring to encompass and surpass the insights of competing schools of thought.""  The author provides a historical example of this process by mentioning ""the Neo-Confucian revival in Song dynasty China…in relation to Daoism.""  Specifically, some sinologists (scholars of China's history) argue that this revival entailed ""'co-opting Daoist terminology to show that the Confucian worldview was actually more inclusive than the Daoist.'""  Accordingly, Neo-Confucianism is portrayed as striving to absorb Daoism and go beyond its doctrines.
In Paragraph 5, the author returns to this idea in larger scope: ""Perhaps the world will one day produce a Grand Unified Theory of Humanism which encompasses all major strands of humanistic thinking—or which, at the least, will ever more closely reflect the reality they mutually seek to describe.""  Thus, just as Neo-Confucianism sought to encompass and surpass the insights of Daoism, the author suggests that over time multiple schools of humanistic thought may be incorporated into a larger, unified framework.  Therefore, the mention in Paragraph 1 of the Neo-Confucian revival in Song dynasty China exemplifies an idea developed further in the last paragraph.
 By contrast, none of the following statements describes the function served by the mention of the Neo-Confucian revival in Song dynasty China:
It helps to clarify the comparisons made in Paragraph 3 (Choice A).  Paragraph 2 states that ""the Supreme Ultimate…invites comparison to Plato's Theory of Forms,"" and Paragraph 3 then does compare these concepts.  However, the earlier mention of the Neo-Confucian revival in Song dynasty China does not provide any information about either the Supreme Ultimate or Plato's Theory of Forms.  Accordingly, that mention does not help to clarify the comparisons made in Paragraph 3.
It introduces a difficulty to be resolved in subsequent paragraphs (Choice B).  The author states that after ""co-opting Daoist terminology"" into Neo-Confucianism, ""[t]he result, strangely enough, was a cosmology (conception of how the world is ordered) with resemblances to both Platonic rationalism and Augustinian Christianity"" (Paragraph 1).  However, the author does not portray this fact as a difficulty to be resolved, but rather as an interesting topic to be explored.
It anticipates the significant disparities discussed in Paragraph 4 (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 4, a similarity can be seen in ""Neo-Confucian and Augustinian ideologies regarding the nature of evil,"" even though ""the views do exhibit significant disparities.""  However, while Paragraph 1 states that Neo-Confucianism bears ""resemblances to…Augustinian Christianity,"" it makes no reference to any disparities between these ideologies."
"183","The Grand Unified Theory of Humanism envisioned by the author (Paragraph 5) would require the existence of:","B","33","Clearly, neither Plato nor Augustine had contact with Zhu Xi or other Neo-Confucianists.  Hundreds of years and thousands of miles separate these thinkers, making all the more striking the similarities between Platonic and Neo-Confucian metaphysics, and between Augustinian and Neo-Confucian views of good and evil.  Perhaps the world will one day produce a Grand Unified Theory of Humanism which encompasses all major strands of humanistic thinking—or which, at the least, will ever more closely reflect the reality they mutually seek to describe. (Paragraph 5)
The author highlights parallels between Neo-Confucian views on one hand, and Platonic and Augustinian views on the other.  However, he or she also points out that these parallels developed in isolation from each other: ""Clearly, neither Plato nor Augustine had contact with Zhu Xi or other Neo-Confucianists…making all the more striking the similarities between Platonic and Neo-Confucian metaphysics, and between Augustinian and Neo-Confucian views of good and evil"" (Paragraph 5).
Thus, based on the ""striking…similarities"" between thinkers separated by ""[h]undreds of years and thousands of miles,"" the author envisions the possibility of ""a Grand Unified Theory of Humanism which encompasses all major strands of humanistic thinking"" (Paragraph 5).  Accordingly, such a theory would require the existence of a conceptual similarity across diverse intellectual traditions.
 (Choices A and C)  significant cultural exchange; and a common source for diverse intellectual traditions.  According to Paragraph 5, ""neither Plato nor Augustine had contact with Zhu Xi or other Neo-Confucianists.  Hundreds of years and thousands of miles separate these thinkers.""  Therefore, although the author discusses similarities between the thinkers' views, those similarities developed in the absence of cultural contact.  Consequently, the ""Grand Unified Theory of Humanism"" envisioned by the author would not require significant cultural exchange or a common source for diverse intellectual traditions.
(Choice D)  new approaches to scholarship.  Paragraph 1 draws a comparison between scientific inquiry and humanistic inquiry: ""As with rival scientific theories, acceptance of a humanistic framework can be gained by endeavouring to encompass and surpass the insights of competing schools of thought.""  Accordingly, the author suggests that progress toward a more unified humanistic framework is achieved using existing scholarly methods.  Therefore, the ""Grand Unified Theory of Humanism"" envisioned by the author would not require new approaches to scholarship."
"184","For which of the following passage assertions does the author NOT provide support?","A","33","Everything in the universe depends upon the Supreme Ultimate, which Zhu Xi further identifies as ""the principle of the highest good.""  Naturally, such a description invites comparison to Plato's Theory of Forms; in particular, the idea that everything in the universe is but a paler or brighter imitation of the Form of the Good, from which all existence is derived. (Paragraph 2)
To be certain, the claim that ""each and every thing has in it the Supreme Ultimate"" is not an exact analogue to the Platonic notion that all things possess a degree of reality commensurate with how closely they resemble the Good.  The Supreme Ultimate's inherence in material objects is distributive, not hierarchical. (Paragraph 3)
According to the passage, the description of the ""Supreme Ultimate"" in Neo-Confucianism ""invites comparison to Plato's Theory of Forms"" (Paragraph 2).  The author then conveys more specifically that in Plato's Theory of Forms, ""all things possess a degree of reality commensurate with how closely they resemble the Good"" (Paragraph 3).  However, the author makes this assertion about the Theory of Forms without citing any sources of textual evidence.  Accordingly, he or she does not provide support for that passage assertion.
 By contrast, the author provides textual evidence from other sources to support all of the following passage assertions:
""[A]cceptance of a humanistic framework can be gained by endeavouring to encompass and surpass the insights of competing schools of thought"" (Paragraph 1) (Choice B).  Paragraph 1 cites the work of sinologists (scholars of China's history) DeBary and Bloom, who provide a historical example of such an endeavour.  According to these scholars, proponents of Neo-Confucianism attempted to absorb the insights of Daoism: ""'In effect, [Neo-Confucianist Zhou Dunyi] was co-opting Daoist terminology to show that the Confucian worldview was actually more inclusive than the Daoist.'""
There are notable parallels between ""Neo-Confucian and Augustinian ideologies regarding the nature of evil"" (Paragraph 4) (Choice C).  Paragraph 4 provides quotations that display these parallels.  First, the author cites Augustine's Confessions: ""'When I asked myself what wickedness was, I saw that it was not a substance, but perversion of the will when it turns away from you, O God.'""  The author then notes the similar view of the scholar Zhu Xi, who wrote: ""'It is not true that there is originally an evil existing out there, waiting for the appearance of good to oppose it.  We fall into evil only when our actions are not in accord with the original nature.'""
""In Neo-Confucian doctrine, the 'Supreme Ultimate' comprises principle, conceived of as the origin and essence of existence, and material force, which permeates corporeal things"" (Paragraph 2) (Choice D).  As evidence for this assertion, Paragraph 2 cites the words of ""the scholar Zhu Xi: 'Principle refers to the Way, which is above the realm of corporeality and is the source from which all things are produced.'""  Similarly, Paragraph 3 references Zhu Xi's claim that ""'[w]ithout material force, principle would have nothing to adhere to.'"""
"185","Based on the author's view in the passage, the relation between different humanistic frameworks may one day be analogous to the relation between:","A","33","As with rival scientific theories, acceptance of a humanistic framework can be gained by endeavouring to encompass and surpass the insights of competing schools of thought. (Paragraph 1)
Hundreds of years and thousands of miles separate these thinkers, making all the more striking the similarities….  Perhaps the world will one day produce a Grand Unified Theory of Humanism which encompasses all major strands of humanistic thinking—or which, at the least, will ever more closely reflect the reality they mutually seek to describe. (Paragraph 5)
In Paragraph 1, the author asserts that both scientific and humanistic frameworks become accepted as they ""encompass and surpass the insights of competing schools of thought.""  Paragraph 5 then revisits this idea with humanistic frameworks on a much larger scale: ""Perhaps the world will one day produce a Grand Unified Theory of Humanism which encompasses all major strands of humanistic thinking—or which, at the least, will ever more closely reflect the reality they mutually seek to describe.""  Therefore, the author envisions a process whereby some humanistic frameworks come to incorporate others.  In this way, a narrower framework is wholly contained within a broader one that offers a more complete understanding.
Similarly, algebra encompasses all the principles and operations of arithmetic but also goes beyond them: the insights of the narrower discipline are contained within the insights of the broader one.  Thus, algebra includes all of arithmetic and surpasses it, thereby representing a fuller and more adequate system of mathematics.  Therefore, based on the author's view in the passage, the relation between different humanistic frameworks may one day be analogous to the relation between algebra and arithmetic.
 By contrast, none of the following pairs stand in such a relation to each other:
zoology and botany (Choice B).  Each of these disciplines concerns the study of living organisms; however, zoology studies animals while botany studies plants.  Accordingly, the insights of one discipline are not contained within the insights of the other.
geology and astronomy (Choice C).  Geology studies the composition of the earth and its change over time, while astronomy studies celestial bodies; neither of these fields includes the other as a subset.
fiction and non-fiction (Choice D).  Fiction and non-fiction are complementary domains of writing; neither encompasses the other within itself."
"186","In the context of the passage, Spoto's phrase ""remarkably unorthodox"" (Paragraph 4) suggests that Jackie's scholarship application:","A","34","The contest committee judged Jackie's essay to have exhibited a profound appreciation for the arts combined with a truly outstanding level of intellectual maturity and originality of thought.  Similarly, biographer Donald Spoto deemed Jackie ""remarkably unorthodox,"" not unlike the men about whom she wrote in her unusual composition which he pronounced ""a masterpiece of perceptive improvisation.""  Thus, from a pool of 1,279 applicants representing 224 colleges, Jacqueline Bouvier was declared the winner. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 stresses that Jackie's scholarship essay stood out from the submissions of her peers and was judged by the committee ""to have exhibited…a truly outstanding level of intellectual maturity and originality of thought.""  The passage further describes this essay as ""unusual""; in fact, Donald Spoto called it ""'a masterpiece of perceptive improvisation.'""  Furthermore, Spoto portrayed Jackie herself as ""'remarkably unorthodox,'"" like her chosen subjects who in their own era were iconoclasts or tradition breakers.  Such comments seem to indicate that Jackie's scholarship application, which was selected as the winner ""[f]rom a pool of 1,279 applicants,"" articulated views that were original and perhaps radical.
Accordingly, the author relates how Jackie's application, particularly her essay and the viewpoints it expressed, stood out from those of her peers, deeply impressing the committee members.  Therefore, in the context of the passage, Spoto's phrase ""remarkably unorthodox"" (Paragraph 4) suggests that Jackie's scholarship application displayed her surprising viewpoints.
 By contrast, in the context of the passage, Spoto's phrase ""remarkably unorthodox"" does not suggest that Jackie's application:
reflected her unconventional education (Choice B).  Although Paragraph 2 mentions that the scholarship contest was ""open to young women in their final undergraduate year,"" the passage never discusses Jackie's education nor suggests that it was unconventional.
bent the contest rules (Choice C).  As Paragraph 2 indicates, the Prix de Paris scholarship contestants ""were asked to compose a 500-word essay, 'People I Wish I Had Known,' spotlighting three individuals influential in art, literature, or culture.""  For her submission, Jackie selected ""an iconoclastic trio from the Victorian era"" who were artistically influential, including ""the French symbolist poet Charles Baudelaire, the Irish wit Oscar Wilde, and the innovative Ballets Russes dance company founder Sergei Diaghilev.""  Thus, she appears to have followed that rule for her essay.  Furthermore, the passage never suggests she bent any of the other contest rules.
described individuals who seemed unlike her (Choice D).  Paragraph 4 conveys Donald Spoto's comment on Jackie's Prix de Paris contest submission that she was ""'remarkably unorthodox,' not unlike the men about whom she wrote.""  Accordingly, the passage indicates that Jackie was similar to rather than different from the men she discussed in her essay."
"187","The passage suggests that Jackie's admiration for the individuals discussed in her essay was related to her:","C","34","In a brief composition, Jackie provided deep insights into the bohemian threesome of poet, aesthete, and impresario with whom she strongly identified….  Furthermore, although these men espoused different disciplines, she discerned that ""a common theory runs through their work, a certain concept of the interrelation of the arts.""  Finally, foreshadowing her self-assumed role in the White House as the nation's unofficial minister of the arts, Jackie paid homage with her vision: ""If I could be a sort of Overall Art Director of the Twentieth Century, watching everything from a chair hanging in space, it is their theories of art that I would apply to my period."" (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, in her Prix de Paris scholarship essay, Jackie observed that for the three individuals she greatly admired (Baudelaire, Wilde, and Diaghilev), ""'a common theory runs through their work, a certain concept of the interrelation of the arts.'""  The future first lady then expressed a wish to adopt this concept of an interconnected or holistic approach to the arts: ""'If I could be a sort of Overall Art Director of the Twentieth Century…it is their theories of art that I would apply to my period.'""
Accordingly, the passage suggests that Jackie's admiration for the individuals discussed in her essay was related to her appreciation for a holistic approach to artistic expression.
 (Choice A)  her dislike for the artists of her own day.  According to Paragraph 2, Jackie admired the ""iconoclastic trio from the Victorian era"" whom she selected to discuss in her Prix de Paris essay.  In particular, she admired their ""'common…concept of the interrelation of the arts'"" (Paragraph 3) and wished to apply it to the art of her own period.  However, the passage never offers Jackie's opinion on the artists of her day, nor does it compare any such artists with the three Victorians.  Therefore, the passage never suggests that Jackie had a dislike for the artists of her own day.
(Choice B)  passion for the social causes highlighted in their works.  Paragraph 3 conveys Jackie's understanding and high regard for the work of the three artists about whom she wrote in her contest essay.  She described the poems of Baudelaire as biting in their use of ""'venom and despair'"" as ""'weapons'""; she went on to describe Wilde's epigrams (short, satirical poems) as highly effective for social reform and Diaghilev's performances as ingeniously produced.  However, although Jackie apparently admired—and even ""strongly identified"" with—these men, the passage never suggests that this admiration was related to her passion for any social causes they might have highlighted in their works.
(Choice D)  emphasis on the actual artworks rather than artistic principles.  In her Prix de Paris essay, Jackie discussed the artistic trio of Baudelaire, Wilde, and Diaghilev, observing that ""'a common theory runs through their work, a certain concept of the interrelation of the arts.'""  Jackie indicated her full support for this concept, claiming, ""'If I could be a sort of Overall Art Director of the Twentieth Century…it is their theories of art that I would apply to my period'"" (Paragraph 3).  Thus, according to the passage, Jackie's admiration for these men was largely related to her emphasis on the artistic theories or principles informing their works."
"188","Which of the following significant accomplishments of Jackie's was most in accord with her stated aspiration?","B","34","Furthermore, while these men espoused different disciplines, she discerned that ""a common theory runs through their work, a certain concept of the interrelation of the arts.""  Finally, foreshadowing her self-assumed role in the White House as the nation's unofficial minister of the arts, Jackie paid homage with her vision: ""If I could be a sort of Overall Art Director of the Twentieth Century, watching everything from a chair hanging in space, it is their theories of art that I would apply to my period."" (Paragraph 3)
In expressing her admiration for the work of Baudelaire, Wilde, and Diaghilev in her Prix de Paris scholarship essay, Jackie focused closely on ""'a certain concept of the interrelation of the arts'"" that she believed these three men shared.  Jackie then connected this admiration for her subjects with a personal aspiration to become a visionary art director.  In her own words, ""'If I could be a sort of Overall Art Director of the Twentieth Century…it is their theories of art that I would apply to my period.'""
After becoming first lady, Jackie used her initiative to take on the ""role in the White House as the nation's unofficial minister of the arts"" (Paragraph 3).  This role allowed her to direct and facilitate artistic achievements, thus fulfilling some of the aspiration she had expressed in her essay.  Therefore, although Jackie could claim other significant accomplishments in the White House, organizing exhibitions of famous artworks and concerts by renowned musicians constituted the achievement most in accord with her stated aspiration.
 By contrast, the following significant accomplishments of Jackie's were less in accord with her stated aspiration:
Promoting the establishment of a memorial library for the Kennedy presidency (Choice A).  This accomplishment centers on the historical legacy of the former first lady's slain husband rather than on the arts.  Furthermore, this scenario depicts Jackie primarily as the promoter rather than the director of a project.
Setting fashion trends with elegant and sophisticated clothing styles (Choice C).  Although fashion may include artistic elements, initiating fashion trends is not clearly connected to the world of the fine arts that Jackie discussed in her essay.  Moreover, such an accomplishment constitutes setting a kind of example in society rather than taking on a directorship role for an artistic project.
Initiating a ""historic restoration"" of the White House and its furnishings (Choice D).  Although Jackie assumed a leadership role in this undertaking, the project was focused less on art than on historical accuracy and the acquisition of material objects of various kinds."
"189","Based on the passage, when evaluating essays for the Prix de Paris scholarship contest, the committee seemed to consider:
the applicant's level of intellectual maturity.
the applicant's appreciation for the arts.
the degree of original thought displayed by the applicant's essay.","D","34","The contest committee judged Jackie's essay to have exhibited a profound appreciation for the arts combined with a truly outstanding level of intellectual maturity and originality of thought….  Thus, from a pool of 1,279 applicants representing 224 colleges, Jacqueline Bouvier was declared the winner. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 discusses how the Prix de Paris committee members evaluated Jackie's application, which was judged the winning submission.  For example, in assessing Ms. Bouvier's essay they focused on how it showed ""a truly outstanding level of intellectual maturity.""  Consequently, when evaluating essays for the Prix de Paris contest, the committee seemed to consider the applicant's level of intellectual maturity (Number I).
As Paragraph 4 states, the contest committee found Jackie's essay to be genuinely outstanding in part because it demonstrated ""a profound appreciation for the arts.""  Therefore, based on the passage, when evaluating essays for the Prix de Paris scholarship, the committee seemed to consider the applicant's appreciation for the arts (Number II).
According to Paragraph 4, Jackie's scholarship application impressed the contest committee members in part because her essay demonstrated ""a truly outstanding level of intellectual maturity and originality of thought.""  Hence, when evaluating essays for the Prix de Paris scholarship contest, the committee seemed to consider the degree of original thought displayed by the applicant's essay (Number III)."
"190","The primary purpose of the passage is to:","C","34","Indeed, upon her death in 1994, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was described as ""the most intriguing woman in the world.""  Often topping lists of the most admired individuals of the second half of the 20th century, this celebrated woman is likely someone many wish they had known.  Barring such a possibility, the best way to fully appreciate Jackie's exceptional nature might be to consider the people she wished she had known. (Paragraph 1)
It is unsurprising that the woman who captured the public's imagination for decades distinguished herself from her peers early on. (Paragraph 2)
The contest committee judged Jackie's essay to have exhibited a profound appreciation for the arts combined with a truly outstanding level of intellectual maturity and originality of thought.  Similarly, biographer Donald Spoto deemed Jackie ""remarkably unorthodox,"" not unlike the men about whom she wrote in her unusual composition which he pronounced ""a masterpiece of perceptive improvisation.""  Thus, from a pool of 1,279 applicants representing 224 colleges, Jacqueline Bouvier was declared the winner. (Paragraph 4)
Much of the passage highlights the various ways in which Jackie was exceptional or unique.  As Paragraph 1 points out, ""[U]pon her death in 1994, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was described as 'the most intriguing woman in the world.'""  Jackie is also said to have been among ""the most admired individuals of the second half of the 20th century"" and ""likely someone many wish they had known.""  Furthermore, the passage author refers to ""Jackie's exceptional nature.""
Paragraph 2 indicates that Jackie ""captured the public's imagination for decades"" and ""distinguished herself from her peers early on.""  Accordingly, her exceptional nature was on display; for example, she won the Prix de Paris scholarship contest.  As Paragraph 4 reveals, ""The contest committee judged Jackie's essay to have exhibited a profound appreciation for the arts combined with a truly outstanding level of intellectual maturity and originality of thought.""  Likewise, as biographer Donald Spoto notes, Jackie showed herself to be ""'remarkably unorthodox,' not unlike the men about whom she wrote,"" and ""her unusual composition [was] 'a masterpiece of perceptive improvisation.'""
Therefore, since a good deal of the passage focuses on Jackie's exceptional nature, its primary purpose is to emphasize Jackie's uniqueness.
 By contrast, the passage's primary purpose is not to:
explore Jackie's many facets (Choice A).  Paragraph 1 calls the former first lady ""[m]ultifaceted,"" describing her as a ""culture advocate, historic preservationist, polyglot (one who speaks multiple languages), equestrienne (horsewoman), and book editor.""  However, the passage never provides details about most of these different facets of her personality.  Instead, it focuses on Jackie's uniqueness, as illustrated by her Prix de Paris essay.
outline Jackie's early life (Choice B).  Paragraph 1 states that Jackie was ""[b]orn in New York in 1929,"" but the passage says nothing about her life prior to entering the Prix de Paris scholarship contest in her final year of college.  The remainder of the passage then focuses on the contents of her Prix de Paris essay and how it reveals her exceptional nature.  Thus, the passage neglects to outline Jackie's early life.
investigate Jackie's popularity (Choice D).  The author does highlight Jackie's popularity, describing her as someone who ""never ceased to fascinate"" and was once called ""'the most intriguing woman in the world.""  Jackie is further described as ""topping lists of the most admired individuals of the second half of the 20th century"" and ""likely someone many wish they had known.""  However, this discussion of Jackie's popularity is mostly limited to Paragraph 1; the bulk of the passage provides the details of her scholarship essay and conveys her vision of the arts."
"191","The claim in Paragraph 1 that a well-made educational entertainment program would be ""worthwhile to watch for its entertainment value alone"" suggests that:","C","35","The word ""edutainment"" refers to educational entertainment, media designed to educate while entertaining the audience….  Focusing on mathematics, Square One aimed to instruct elementary school children in a way that captured their attention and made them eager to learn.  Such objectives are common to most attempts at teaching.  But well-made educational entertainment goes a step further than simply trying to make learning enjoyable; ideally, the program is of a quality such that audiences find it worthwhile to watch for its entertainment value alone. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 indicates that educational entertainment is ""designed to educate while entertaining the audience.""  Specifically, the passage states that ""well-made educational entertainment goes a step further than simply trying to make learning enjoyable"" and clarifies that this additional step means making a program ""that audiences find it worthwhile to watch for its entertainment value alone"" (Paragraph 1).  Accordingly, such a program would be worth viewing for its enjoyable content, regardless of any teaching that may take place during the program.  Therefore, the phrase suggests that the program's viewership would not be diminished by its educational content.
  (Choice A)  the program's content would emphasize entertainment over the educational aspect.  Based on Paragraph 1, well-made educational entertainment ""goes a step further than simply trying to make learning enjoyable""; in fact, it makes the show ""worthwhile to watch for its entertainment value alone.""  This means that viewers would enjoy watching such a show regardless of the content it is trying to teach, not that a well-made ""edutainment"" program would emphasize entertainment over education.
(Choice B)  viewers would respond to the program differently than they would to a non-educational program.  The author's statement that well-made educational entertainment would be ""worthwhile to watch for its entertainment value alone"" (Paragraph 1) suggests that viewers would respond to such a program just as they would to a well-made, purely entertainment-focused (ie, non-educational) program.  Therefore, the passage suggests that viewers would respond similarly, rather than differently, to well-made educational entertainment and non-educational programs.
(Choice D)  educators would have good reason to be happy about the program's existence.  Paragraph 5 states that ""[t]eachers had good reason to be happy about [Square One's] existence, and its lively presentation of educational concepts can surely be credited with the improved academic performance of many students.""  However, the phrase ""worthwhile to watch for its entertainment value alone"" (Paragraph 1) refers to the attitudes of audiences in general rather than to educators in particular."
"192","Which of the following passage claims is LEAST supported by examples in the passage?","A","35","In addition to the music, skits, cartoons, and parodies constituting many of the program's segments, game shows were another way in which Square One imparted instruction.  The prizes were unexciting (everyday apparel bearing the Square One logo), but that was to be expected for a production that aired on public broadcasting.  Of course, the prizes were also not the point.  Part of the draw of a commercial game show may be a fabulous package of expensive prizes and money, but the game shows of Square One focused on education. (Paragraph 4)
In Paragraph 4, the author states that ""[i]n addition to the music, skits, cartoons, and parodies constituting many of the program's segments, game shows were another way in which Square One imparted instruction.""  He or she goes on to claim that unlike commercial game shows, ""the game shows of Square One focused on education.""  However, although the passage discusses how Square One was educational in general, the author provides no examples to describe how its game shows were educational in particular.
Therefore, the author's claim that Square One's game shows focused on education is least supported by examples in the passage.
  By contrast, the author supports each of the following claims by providing specific examples in the passage:
Square One presented its material in a variety of different forms (Choice B).  Paragraph 3 provides examples of Square One's music videos such as ""Ghost of a Chance,"" as well as a skit, ""What's in a Name,"" and a parodied television show, ""Mathnet.""  Paragraph 4 further describes this variety by noting that ""[i]n addition to the music, comedy skits, cartoons, and parodies constituting many of the program's segments, game shows were another way in which Square One imparted instruction.""
Square One's music videos tended to be humorous (Choice C).  In Paragraph 2, the author cites two examples meant to illustrate how ""most of the songs contained humorous elements: the exhausted singers of 'That's Infinity' tried vainly to reach the largest number, while 'Eight Percent of My Love' saw a boy serenade his girlfriend about the small fraction of love he could give her (having already given away 92 percent to friends, the USA, his bicycle, and other things).""
Square One included some entertainment that adults understood more than children (Choice D).  Paragraph 3 provides several examples of material with ""aspects that were often more noticeable to parents than to the child viewers themselves,"" such as the song ""Ghost of a Chance,"" the character ""Juan Cougar,"" the skit ""What's in a Name?,"" and the parody show ""Mathnet."""
"193","As the phrase is used in the passage, ""excessively didactic"" (Paragraph 5) probably refers to:","C","35","In light of that distinction, one can imagine the most typical criticism of any educational entertainment program.  Education and entertainment are, at their cores, not aimed at the same ends.  Whether it is the worse crime to be insufficiently didactic or to be excessively didactic may depend on whom one asks; either way, one might worry that a work attempting to impart both amusement and instruction would ultimately fail in at least one of those objectives. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 conveys that because educational entertainment programs attempt ""to impart both amusement and instruction (ie, both entertainment and education),"" they run the risk of ""ultimately fail[ing] in at least one of those objectives.""  In other words, these ""edutainment"" programs run the risk of being either ""insufficiently didactic"" (entertaining but not educational enough) or ""excessively didactic"" (too educational and not entertaining enough).  In this context being too educational means that the show lacks entertainment value; therefore, the phrase ""excessively didactic"" probably refers to an instructional method that is insufficiently entertaining.
  By contrast, ""excessively didactic"" would probably not refer to any of the following:
an inflexible attitude toward teaching (Choice A).  An inflexible attitude means only that the teacher is unlikely to change his or her teaching methods; it would not necessarily mean that his or her instruction is ""excessively didactic"" (too educational and not entertaining enough).  For instance, the teacher could be inflexibly committed to trying to amuse students while teaching a subject.
an ineffective presentation of a lesson plan (Choice B).  An ineffective presentation would suggest that the teacher delivered his or her lesson plan poorly.  However, this ineffective delivery would not necessarily mean that the lesson plan was too focused on education at the expense of entertainment.  For instance, the teacher's presentation might simply be confusing or difficult to follow.
an instructional method that is overly complex (Choice D).  An overly complex method might still be very entertaining to students and not necessarily ""excessively didactic.""  For example, if a teacher asked students to play an amusing but difficult game to learn mathematical concepts, the method could be overly complex but the learning fun."
"194","What is the main point of the passage?","D","35","The word ""edutainment"" refers to educational entertainment, media designed to educate while entertaining the audience.  One of the more successful of such enterprises was Square One, a television show that aired in the 1980s and 1990s. (Paragraph 1)
...either way, one might worry that a work attempting to impart both amusement and instruction would ultimately fail in at least one of those objectives.  Yet Square One was that rare instance in which both goals were met. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 1 notes that educational entertainment is ""designed to educate while entertaining the audience,"" and that Square One was ""[o]ne of the more successful of such enterprises.""  The rest of the passage is spent describing Square One, at the end of which Paragraph 5 states that ""Square One was that rare instance in which both goals (of education and entertainment) were met.""  Accordingly, the main point of the passage is that Square One was an especially successful example of educational entertainment.
  (Choice A)  Square One was successful even among students who did not enjoy mathematics.  Paragraph 5 states that ""[m]any children who disliked mathematics in school still enjoyed viewing a show with songs and skits about the subject.""  However, this statement is just one of many claims supporting the passage's central point regarding Square One's overall success as an educational entertainment program.
(Choice B)  Square One was the most successful example of well-made ""edutainment"" programs.  Paragraph 1 describes some of the features of ""well-made educational entertainment"" and notes that Square One was ""[o]ne of the more successful of such enterprises.""  However, the passage does not state that Square One was the most successful example of educational entertainment programs.
(Choice C)  Square One's success illustrates why ""edutainment"" can be a valuable resource for teachers.  The passage states that ""[t]eachers had good reason to be happy about [Square One's] existence"" and that the program ""can surely be credited with the improved academic performance of many students"" (Paragraph 5).  However, the main point of the passage is the success of Square One as an ""edutainment"" program.  Its approval from teachers is simply one component of that success."
"195","On the basis of the information contained in the passage, which of the following would one probably NOT expect to find as a segment in an episode of Square One?","D","35","Focusing on mathematics, Square One aimed to instruct elementary school children in a way that captured their attention and made them eager to learn. (Paragraph 1)
Songs like ""Angle Dance"" and ""Less Than Zero"" described concepts such as acuteness or negative numbers…the exhausted singers of ""That's Infinity"" tried vainly to reach the largest number, while ""Eight Percent of My Love"" saw a boy serenade his girlfriend about the small fraction of love he could give her (having already given away 92 percent to friends, the USA, his bicycle, and other things). (Paragraph 2)
In addition to the music, skits, cartoons, and parodies constituting many of the program's segments, game shows were another way in which Square One imparted instruction. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 mentions ""the music, skits, cartoons, and parodies constituting many of the program's segments.""  Thus, all of these types of programs would appear as segments of Square One.
However, Paragraph 1 states that ""Square One aimed to instruct elementary school children,"" and Paragraph 2 provides examples of concepts that the show taught, such as percentages, the meaning of acuteness, and the fact that there is no largest number.  Given the age of the target audience and the examples of concepts described, it is clear that the show focused on more basic mathematical ideas rather than high-level equations.  Therefore, one would probably not expect to find ""Adventures of Gal-culus,"" a cartoon where a superheroine explains how to solve high-level mathematical equations, as a segment in an episode of Square One.
  By contrast, all of the following involve less advanced mathematical concepts and would be much more likely to appear in a program aimed at elementary school children:
""Workout the Answer,"" a skit where a fitness guru explains how to determine time or distance exercised (Choice A).  Determining time or distance exercised involves only simple arithmetic.
""Pump Up the Volume,"" a song where a band explains how to measure the volume of geometric shapes (Choice B).  Measuring the volume of geometric shapes involves only basic geometry.
""Al Gebra, P.I.,"" a parody where a private investigator explains how to use algebraic variables (Choice C).  Using algebraic variables involves only foundational concepts of algebra."
"196","Based on passage information, which of the following is most analogous to the role of popular culture references in Square One?","B","35","The creativity of these songs featured popular culture aspects that were often more noticeable to parents than to the child viewers themselves….  Other parts of the show included similar references.  Details such as these functioned as a bonus, however, as the target audience found the material compelling despite not grasping all the references that elicited smiles from their elders.  Cabot and Marshmallow's ""What's in a Name?"" was comedic even without knowledge of the famous Abbott and Costello ""Who's on First?"" skit from which it was derived. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, Square One's material ""featured popular culture aspects that were often more noticeable to parents than to the child viewers themselves.""  However, the author asserts that ""the target audience found the material compelling despite not grasping all the references….""  For example, ""Cabot and Marshmallow's 'What's in a Name?' was comedic even without knowledge of the famous Abbott and Costello 'Who's on First?' skit from which it was derived.""  As such, these references ""functioned as a bonus"" to Square One's material but were not integral to the purpose of the program, which was to teach and entertain.
Similarly, diamonds decorating a watch are extra additions (ie, a bonus feature) that are not integral to the purpose of the watch, which is to tell time.  Accordingly, these diamonds are most analogous to the role of popular culture references in Square One.
  By contrast, none of the following are analogous to the role of popular culture references in Square One, because they are main features rather than a bonus:
the feathers of a peacock, a distinctive and obvious mark of the species (Choice A).  Because a peacock's feathers are distinctive and obvious, they are a primary component of any person's conception of the animal.  The same is not true of Square One's popular culture references, which were extra features ""that were often more noticeable to parents than to the child viewers themselves"" (Paragraph 3).
the external frame of a house, supporting the rest of the structure (Choice C).  The support provided by the frame of a house is essential for the rest of the structure to stand, rather than a bonus feature like the popular culture references in Square One.
a hidden code in a document, expressing the document's true meaning (Choice D).  Knowledge of such a code would be required to understand the main point of the document in question.  However, knowledge of Square One's popular culture references was not required to understand the main point of its material, which was ""amusing and instructional, even to those too young"" to understand those references (Paragraph 3)."
"197","Suppose that clothing with the Square One logo currently sells for large amounts of money online and is worn throughout the country.  If true, how would this information affect the author's claims about Square One's game shows?","C","35","One of the more successful of such enterprises was Square One, a television show that aired in the 1980s and 1990s. (Paragraph 1)
…game shows were another way in which Square One imparted instruction.  The prizes were unexciting (everyday apparel bearing the Square One logo), but that was to be expected for a production that aired on public broadcasting.  Of course, the prizes were also not the point.  Part of the draw of a commercial game show may be a fabulous package of expensive prizes and money, but the game shows of Square One focused on education. (Paragraph 4)
The passage states that when Square One ""aired in the 1980s and 1990s"" (Paragraph 1), the ""everyday apparel bearing the Square One logo"" that served as prizes for its game shows was ""unexciting"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, the author claims that when the game shows were actually taking place (around thirty years ago), the prizes were not considered exciting or valuable.
If the apparel in question currently sells for large amounts of money online and is worn throughout the country, that would indicate that the apparel is now considered to be valuable and exciting to own or wear.  However, that fact would not change the way that the prizes were perceived by those who originally watched or participated in Square One's game shows.
Therefore, even if apparel with the Square One logo currently sells for large amounts of money online, it would not affect what the author says about Square One's game shows when they originally aired.
  (Choices A and D)  It would challenge what the author says about Square One's game shows; and It would support what the author says about Square One's game shows.  Paragraph 4 states that Square One's ""prizes were unexciting,"" unlike the ""fabulous package of expensive prizes"" that one may find on a commercial game show.  Even if the prizes for Square One's game shows currently sold for large amounts of money online and were worn throughout the country, that fact would not change how the prizes were perceived when Square One and its game shows originally aired.  Therefore, that fact would neither challenge nor support the author's claims about Square One's game shows.
(Choice B)  It would lessen the distinction between commercial game shows and Square One's game shows.  The author distinguishes commercial game shows from Square One's game shows by noting that the former typically offer ""a fabulous package of expensive prizes and money,"" but the latter ""focused on education,"" as ""the prizes were…not the point.""  Even if the prizes from Square One's game shows were now considered expensive and exciting, that would not change the fact that those prizes seemed unexciting when the game shows originally aired.  Therefore, the current perception of the prizes would not lessen the distinction between commercial game shows and the game shows on Square One."
"198","The main purpose of the passage is:","D","36","A common charge leveled at elected officeholders is that they are ""playing politics.""  The implication of the claim is that its target has skewed priorities: he or she ought to care about addressing the needs of the citizenry through legislation and governing but is wrongly focused on politics instead. (Paragraph 1)
In the classical sense, however….ethics concerns the good of the individual, while politics concerns the good of society. (Paragraph 2)
In other words, the object of political power is to bring to fruition a particular conception of the good….  But if the power itself is the goal—if one seeks authority for the sake of having authority—then the good of society becomes either forsaken entirely or, at best, an afterthought. (Paragraph 3)
In this cynical form of politics….  A party that achieves nothing, or even stands for nothing, can still maintain power if the alternative party seems sufficiently loathsome—even if, ironically, the supposed loathsomeness comes from a perception that its members are ""playing politics."" (Paragraph 4)
So how do we fix this problem, restoring the original sense of ""politics"" in the minds of both voters and politicians?  The answer is twofold.  First, politicians must commit themselves to acting in good faith and to upholding a kind of mutual aspiration….  Second, citizens must commit themselves to valuing nuanced positions and open-minded reflection from candidates, rather than the snappy soundbites and one-liners that typify so much of political debate and media coverage.  If each group strives to embody these aims, we can return to genuinely engaging in politics rather than playing politics. (Paragraph 5)
The passage begins with a discussion of ""playing politics,"" the accusation that a politician ""ought to care about addressing the needs of the citizenry…but is wrongly focused on politics instead"" (Paragraph 1).  The author contrasts this idea with the classical Aristotelian conception that politics intrinsically ""concerns the good of society"" (Paragraph 2).
Paragraph 3 connects these ideas with politicians' failure to uphold the ideal that ""the object of political power is to bring to fruition a particular conception of the good.""  Such politicians are not focused on the public good because for them ""power itself is the goal,"" so ""the good of society becomes…at best, an afterthought.""  Paragraph 4 further criticizes ""this cynical form of politics"" in which parties try to maintain power primarily by depicting their opposition as ""sufficiently loathsome (vile or disgusting)"" by comparison.
The preceding considerations all lead up to the question: ""So how do we fix this problem, restoring the original sense of 'politics' in the minds of both voters and politicians?"" (Paragraph 5).  The author offers solutions to address the problems discussed in the passage, promoting the conclusion that ""we can return to genuinely engaging in politics rather than playing politics.""
Accordingly, the passage is structured to first describe a puzzling feature of modern politics, then evaluate that feature as problematic, and finally present solutions for changing it.  Therefore, the main purpose of the passage is to encourage reform of ideas and practices surrounding modern politics.
 By contrast, although the author discusses the following ideas, the main purpose of the passage goes beyond them:
to contrast the modern conception of politics with the classical Aristotelian conception (Choice A).  Paragraph 1 notes the modern criticism that a politician ""ought to care about addressing the needs of the citizenry…but is wrongly focused on politics instead.""  However, the contrast between this idea and the classical Aristotelian conception, in which ""there is no distinction between engaging in politics and addressing society's needs"" (Paragraph 2), functions to highlight a problem in modern politics that the author wants to reform.
to explore implications of the fact that politics is essentially based on struggle (Choice B).  Paragraph 3 describes politics as ""a struggle between competing ideas about the good of society and between competing aspirants to society's leadership.""  However, exploring this idea leads to the ultimate goal of ""restoring the original sense of 'politics' in the minds of both voters and politicians"" (Paragraph 5).
to denounce those who aspire to political power without embodying actual leadership (Choice C).  Paragraph 4 criticizes the ""cynical form of politics…in which the supposed qualification to lead is divorced from leadership.""  However, the author's larger purpose is encouraging the rejection of such cynicism so ""we can return to genuinely engaging in politics rather than playing politics"" (Paragraph 5)."
"199","Suppose studies show that negative campaign advertisements are much more effective at swaying voters than positive advertisements.  How would this finding affect the author's claims in the passage?","C","36","In its ideal form, the latter contest is subordinate to the former.  In other words, the object of political power is to bring to fruition a particular conception of the good, and it is for the sake of that good—a public good—that power is sought and exercised.  But if the power itself is the goal…then the good of society becomes either forsaken entirely or, at best, an afterthought. (Paragraph 3)
When extended to political parties, playing politics would entail striving to aggrandize one's own side or diminish the opposition without actually contributing to the resolution of an issue.  In this cynical form of politics, persuasion is attempted by comparison rather than substance, the vaunting of an empty façade in which the supposed qualification to lead is divorced from leadership.  A party that achieves nothing, or even stands for nothing, can still maintain power if the alternative party seems sufficiently loathsome—even if, ironically, the supposed loathsomeness comes from a perception that its members are ""playing politics."" (Paragraph 4)
Second, citizens must commit themselves to valuing nuanced positions and open-minded reflection from candidates, rather than the snappy soundbites and one-liners that typify so much of political debate and media coverage. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 3, ""In its ideal form…the object of political power is to bring to fruition a particular conception of the good, and it is for the sake of that good…that power is sought and exercised.""  However, if politicians do not live up to this ideal, then political power is treated as an end in itself instead of as a means to improve citizens' well-being: ""if the power itself is the goal…then the good of society becomes either forsaken entirely or, at best, an afterthought.""
Paragraph 4 criticizes this focus on power, especially the tactic of ""striving to aggrandize (glorify) one's own side or diminish the opposition without actually contributing to the resolution of an issue"" so that ""persuasion is attempted by comparison rather than substance.""  In other words, this approach is based primarily on making one's political opponents look bad: ""A party that achieves nothing, or even stands for nothing, can still maintain power if the alternative party seems sufficiently loathsome (vile or disgusting).""
Finally, Paragraph 5 conveys that modern politics is largely based on ""the snappy soundbites and one-liners that typify so much of political debate and media coverage.""  Therefore, if studies show that negative campaign advertisements are much more effective at swaying voters than positive advertisements, those studies would accord with the author's critique of modern politics.  This finding would be consistent with the author's characterization that modern politics focuses on swaying voters by vilifying members of the opposing party.
 (Choice A)  It would challenge the author's claims about a means/ends distinction.  Paragraph 3 discusses ""a means/ends distinction"" in politics, suggesting that often ""political power is viewed as an end in itself.""  If negative campaign advertisements are shown to be more effective than positive ones, this finding would support the author's claim that politicians try to maintain their power by portraying rivals as ""sufficiently loathsome"" (Paragraph 4).
(Choice B)  It would change the relevance of the author's reference to Aristotle.  On the Aristotelian view, ""there is no distinction between engaging in politics and addressing society's needs"" (Paragraph 2).  The author refers to Aristotle as part of an argument for embracing that conception, so that ""we can return to genuinely engaging in politics rather than playing politics"" (Paragraph 5).  The author states that ""playing politics would entail striving to…diminish the opposition"" (Paragraph 4); thus, negative advertisements could be an example.  Accordingly, the effectiveness of such advertisements would not change the relevance of the reference to Aristotle.
(Choice D)  It would suggest that the author's concerns are understated.  The author criticizes the ""cynical form of politics"" in which ""[a] party that achieves nothing, or even stands for nothing, can still maintain power if the alternative party seems sufficiently loathsome"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, the greater effectiveness of negative advertisements would suggest that the author has correctly assessed modern politics, not suggest that his or her concerns are understated."
"200","Implicit in the author's argument is the idea that:","B","36","In other words, the object of political power is to bring to fruition a particular conception of the good, and it is for the sake of that good—a public good—that power is sought and exercised.  But if the power itself is the goal—if one seeks authority for the sake of having authority—then the good of society becomes either forsaken entirely or, at best, an afterthought. (Paragraph 3)
Such an end we might call the ""false microcosm,"" a corrupted analogue to ethics in the framework Aristotle describes.  In that situation, a politician achieves neither society's good nor her own, but simply the continuation of her time in office. (Paragraph 4)
In Paragraph 3, the author states that ideally ""the object of political power is to bring to fruition a particular conception of the good, and it is for the sake of that good—a public good—that power is sought and exercised.""  However, some politicians ignore that basis for politics: ""if the power itself is the goal—if one seeks authority for the sake of having authority—then the good of society becomes either forsaken entirely or, at best, an afterthought.""
The author then asserts: ""In that situation, a politician achieves neither society's good nor her own, but simply the continuation of her time in office"" (Paragraph 4).  Thus, the author states that continuing in office does not serve the politician's own good, which implies that such a politician would be better off leaving office instead.  Accordingly, the author implicitly assumes that some politicians would be better off if they did not seek to remain in office.
 (Choice A)  In the classical conception of politics, political power is an end in itself.  According to Paragraph 2, ""In the classical sense…politics concerns the good of society.""  Paragraph 3 further conveys that under this conception, ""the object of political power is to bring to fruition a particular conception of the good, and it is for the sake of that good—a public good—that power is sought and exercised.""  Therefore, the idea that ""power itself is the goal"" is presented in contrast to the classical conception of politics.
(Choice C)  The ""false microcosm"" can never be completely eliminated.  Paragraph 3 describes how ""power itself is the goal"" for some politicians, so ""the good of society becomes either forsaken entirely or, at best, an afterthought.""  Paragraph 4 calls such a motive ""the 'false microcosm,' a corrupted analogue to ethics in the framework Aristotle describes.""  However, the author never implies that this false microcosm cannot be eliminated.  Rather, he or she suggests that we can ""fix this problem, restoring the original sense of 'politics' in the minds of both voters and politicians"" (Paragraph 5).
(Choice D)  ""Playing politics"" is an inefficient method for winning elections.  According to Paragraph 4, ""A party that achieves nothing, or even stands for nothing, can still maintain power if the alternative party seems sufficiently loathsome—even if, ironically, the supposed loathsomeness comes from a perception that its members are 'playing politics.'""  Therefore, although the author opposes the kind of tactics involved in ""playing politics,"" he or she implies that those tactics can successfully help a political party maintain power.  Accordingly, the author never suggests that playing politics is an inefficient method for winning elections."
"201","In order to uphold the author's ideals, which of the following traits would be most important for a politician to exhibit?","A","36","Politics is inherently agonistic: a struggle between competing ideas about the good of society and between competing aspirants to society's leadership.  In its ideal form, the latter contest is subordinate to the former. (Paragraph 3)
In this cynical form of politics, persuasion is attempted by comparison rather than substance, the vaunting of an empty façade in which the supposed qualification to lead is divorced from leadership.  A party that achieves nothing, or even stands for nothing, can still maintain power if the alternative party seems sufficiently loathsome—even if, ironically, the supposed loathsomeness comes from a perception that its members are ""playing politics."" (Paragraph 4)
So how do we fix this problem, restoring the original sense of ""politics"" in the minds of both voters and politicians?  The answer is twofold.  First, politicians must commit themselves to acting in good faith and to upholding a kind of mutual aspiration.  For instance, when attendees at a 2008 John McCain rally suggested that Barack Obama was untrustworthy and not an American citizen, McCain famously defended his rival as ""a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues."" (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 4 describes a ""cynical form of politics"" in which ""persuasion is attempted by comparison rather than substance.""  Using this tactic, ""[a] party that achieves nothing, or even stands for nothing, can still maintain power if the alternative party seems sufficiently loathsome (vile or disgusting).""  The author rejects this type of politics, recommending steps that can be taken to ""fix this problem, restoring the original sense of 'politics' in the minds of both voters and politicians"" (Paragraph 5).
The first of these recommendations is that ""politicians must commit themselves to acting in good faith and to upholding a kind of mutual aspiration.""  The author illustrates this idea with a real-life example: ""when attendees at a 2008 John McCain rally suggested that Barack Obama was untrustworthy and not an American citizen, McCain famously defended his rival as 'a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues'"" (Paragraph 5).
By making this remark, McCain refused to endorse an unjustly negative personal portrayal of his opponent.  Instead, he characterized the two of them as equally engaged in what the author calls ""a struggle between competing ideas about the good of society and between competing aspirants to society's leadership"" (Paragraph 3).  Thus, McCain encouraged voters to consider each candidate according to an honest assessment of his merits.  Therefore, since the author cites this event as an example of how politicians ought to act, it would be most important for a politician to exhibit integrity in order to uphold the author's ideals.
 (Choice B)  Compassion.  The author praises how John McCain ""famously defended his rival as 'a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues'"" (Paragraph 5).  However, this defense was not primarily a matter of compassion or treating someone with kindness.  Rather, by refusing to go along with an undeservedly negative portrayal of his opponent, McCain exemplified ""acting in good faith,"" displaying a sense of integrity.  Therefore, it is integrity, rather than compassion, that most connects to upholding the author's ideals.
(Choice C)  Self-assuredness.  A sense of self-assuredness would suggest a confidence in one's current position.  However, such confidence would not necessarily lend itself to the ""open-minded reflection from candidates"" that the author views as important (Paragraph 5).  Accordingly, the passage does not suggest that self-assuredness in a politician would be important for upholding the author's ideals.
(Choice D)  Optimism.  The author argues that ""politicians must commit themselves to acting in good faith and to upholding a kind of mutual aspiration"" (Paragraph 5).  However, the author's example of this process is how John McCain ""famously defended his rival"" from an unjustly negative portrayal.  Therefore, the type of aspiration that the author advocates specifically involves exhibiting decency and respect, not necessarily a sense of optimism."
"202","Which of the following scenarios would LEAST exemplify ""playing politics"" as the author describes it?","D","36","A common charge leveled at elected officeholders is that they are ""playing politics.""  The implication of the claim is that its target has skewed priorities: he or she ought to care about addressing the needs of the citizenry through legislation and governing but is wrongly focused on politics instead. (Paragraph 1)
Politics is inherently agonistic: a struggle between competing ideas about the good of society and between competing aspirants to society's leadership.  In its ideal form, the latter contest is subordinate to the former. (Paragraph 3)
When extended to political parties, playing politics would entail striving to aggrandize one's own side or diminish the opposition without actually contributing to the resolution of an issue.  In this cynical form of politics, persuasion is attempted by comparison rather than substance, the vaunting of an empty façade in which the supposed qualification to lead is divorced from leadership. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 1, an accusation of ""'playing politics'"" suggests that a politician ""ought to care about addressing the needs of the citizenry through legislation and governing but is wrongly focused on politics instead.""  Paragraph 4 elaborates on this idea, stating that ""playing politics would entail striving to aggrandize (glorify) one's own side or diminish the opposition without actually contributing to the resolution of an issue.  In this cynical form of politics, persuasion is attempted by comparison rather than substance.""
However, if a mayoral candidate continually stresses how his proposed solutions to the city's problems differ from those proposed by his opponent, he would be offering a comparison that is based on how each of the candidates would address the city's issues.  This fact-based argument for choosing him over his opponent would exemplify the classical conception of politics as ""a struggle between competing ideas about the good of society and between competing aspirants to society's leadership"" (Paragraph 3).  Consequently, this scenario would least exemplify ""'playing politics'"" as the author describes it.
 By contrast, each of the following would more strongly exemplify ""'playing politics'"" as the author describes it:
One party blocks all legislation proposed by another and then tells voters the other party has achieved nothing in office (Choice A).  This scenario exemplifies ""striving to…diminish the opposition without actually contributing to the resolution of an issue"" (Paragraph 4).
In preparation for a re-election campaign, a congressional representative researches the most effective ways to attack her likely opponent (Choice B).  This description mentions how the representative would attack her opponent, but it does not convey anything about her positions or goals in office.  Therefore, it suggests an attempt ""to aggrandize one's own side or diminish the opposition without actually contributing to the resolution of an issue"" (Paragraph 4).
To defend himself against accusations of lying, a senator highlights how frequently many senators are dishonest (Choice C).  Such a senator would be doing nothing to actually address the accusations against him.  Instead, he would simply be portraying other senators as ""sufficiently loathsome (vile or disgusting)"" in an attempt to look less bad by comparison (Paragraph 4)."
"203","The author would probably recommend that political debates should:","A","36","So how do we fix this problem, restoring the original sense of ""politics"" in the minds of both voters and politicians?  The answer is twofold….  Second, citizens must commit themselves to valuing nuanced positions and open-minded reflection from candidates, rather than the snappy soundbites and one-liners that typify so much of political debate and media coverage.  If each group strives to embody these aims, we can return to genuinely engaging in politics rather than playing politics. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 begins by asking: ""So how do we fix this problem [in modern politics], restoring the original sense of 'politics' in the minds of both voters and politicians?""  Part of the author's answer mentions political debate specifically: ""citizens must commit themselves to valuing nuanced positions and open-minded reflection from candidates, rather than the snappy soundbites and one-liners that typify so much of political debate.""
Because the author stresses the value of nuance and reflection, he or she most likely believes that political debate would be improved if politicians gave more detailed descriptions of their positions rather than quick answers to questions (ie, ""snappy soundbites and one-liners"").  Accordingly, the author would most likely recommend that political debates should encourage candidates to give longer, more thorough responses to questions.
 (Choice B)  ensure questions come from moderators representing multiple political parties.  Paragraph 5 conveys the author's disapproval of ""the snappy soundbites and one-liners that typify so much of political debate and media coverage"" (Paragraph 5).  Accordingly, it is possible that he or she would find fault with the kinds of questions asked at debates.  However, the author never discusses moderators or the parties to which they belong.  Moreover, the author's vision for politics concerns ""acting in good faith"" regardless of a candidate's party; by contrast, this scenario would seem to presume partisanship from moderators.
(Choice C)  incorporate more questions from professional scholars rather than ordinary citizens.  The author argues that ""citizens must commit themselves to valuing nuanced positions and open-minded reflection from candidates, rather than the snappy soundbites and one-liners that typify so much of political debate and media coverage"" (Paragraph 5).  However, he or she never discusses the source of the questions posed to candidates, nor suggests that such questions should come from scholars rather than ordinary citizens.
(Choice D)  prioritize asking questions to candidates with the widest voter appeal.  The author advocates ""valuing nuanced positions and open-minded reflection from candidates"" (Paragraph 5), suggesting that he or she favors significant consideration of various ideas.  However, a system that prioritized asking questions to certain candidates would deny others the same opportunities to voice their ideas, limiting the attention and discussion those candidates' views would receive.  Hence, the author would be unlikely to recommend this approach."
"204","Shortly after the rally described in the passage, John McCain went on to lose the 2008 presidential election to Barack Obama.  Does this information undermine the author's recommendations for politicians?","A","36","So how do we fix this problem, restoring the original sense of ""politics"" in the minds of both voters and politicians?  The answer is twofold.  First, politicians must commit themselves to acting in good faith and to upholding a kind of mutual aspiration.  For instance, when attendees at a 2008 John McCain rally suggested that Barack Obama was untrustworthy and not an American citizen, McCain famously defended his rival as ""a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.""  Second, citizens must commit themselves to valuing nuanced positions and open-minded reflection from candidates, rather than the snappy soundbites and one-liners that typify so much of political debate and media coverage.  If each group strives to embody these aims, we can return to genuinely engaging in politics rather than playing politics. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, the goal of the author's recommendations is ""restoring the original sense of 'politics' in the minds of both voters and politicians.""  In order to achieve this goal, ""politicians must commit themselves to acting in good faith and to upholding a kind of mutual aspiration.""  As an example of this ideal, the author cites how John McCain refused to characterize Barack Obama as ""untrustworthy and not an American citizen"" but instead ""famously defended his rival as 'a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.'""
The author argues that if politicians and voters uphold this aspirational approach to political contests, then ""we can return to genuinely engaging in politics rather than playing politics"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, the point of the author's recommendations for politicians is to improve the political process.  However, he or she never suggests that every politician who does so will win his or her election.  (Moreover, only one candidate can win any election, so if both candidates were to follow the author's recommendations, one of them would still lose.)
Consequently, the fact that John McCain lost the 2008 presidential election does not challenge the author's recommendations for politicians; those recommendations are aimed at transforming politics as a whole rather than ensuring particular electoral outcomes.
 Accordingly, the following responses mistake the author's goal to be about winning elections rather than reforming the political process:
Yes, it suggests they are too optimistic (Choice B).  Whether the author's recommendations are too optimistic would depend on whether they promote the ""return to genuinely engaging in politics rather than playing politics"" (Paragraph 5), not on whether a particular candidate wins or loses.
Yes, it reveals they are ineffective (Choice C).  McCain's remark was effective in ""acting in good faith and…upholding a kind of mutual aspiration"" (Paragraph 5), regardless of any electoral impact it may have had.
Yes, it shows they are unreliable (Choice D).  The author's recommendations might reliably help in ""restoring the original sense of 'politics' in the minds of both voters and politicians"" (Paragraph 5), even if individual politicians follow the recommendations and lose their elections."
"205","Given the information in the passage, the assertion that representational art is ""if not objectively, then at least concretely"" superior to abstract art (Paragraph 1) is most likely meant to imply that:","C","37","To begin with, we should make an admission: there is a sense in which—if not objectively, then at least concretely—representational art is superior to abstract art. (Paragraph 1)
Although that claim may seem shocking, the reasons behind it need to be acknowledged.  One advantage of representational art that abstract art often lacks is definite conditions for success.  To a significant degree, with representational works it is clear when an artist has done well: if an object or person has been accurately portrayed, anyone can see that something skillful has been accomplished.  Moreover, human beings have a natural desire to depict the world around us.  With representational art, then, ordinary viewers will generally see some purpose to the work whether or not they discern any deeper meaning or symbolism that the artist may have intended. (Paragraph 2)
With many abstract works, however, there are no broadly accessible grounds for judging their success or failure.  Nor is it always apparent what the purpose of such a work is….  The problem is not necessarily a perception that abstract works lack meaning—the real issue is more subtle. (Paragraph 3)
By stating that representational art is ""not objectively"" superior to abstract art (Paragraph 1), the author implies that it may not be better in an absolute sense or regardless of one's perspective.  However, the idea that it is ""concretely"" superior suggests there is some clearly defined advantage of representational art that motivates people's preference for it.  Paragraph 2 discusses such an advantage by noting that there are ""definite conditions for success"" in representational art that are absent in abstract art.  Specifically, ""if an object or person has been accurately portrayed, anyone can see that something skillful has been accomplished.""
In addition, these success conditions relate to human beings' ""natural desire to depict the world around us.""  As such, ""ordinary viewers will generally see some purpose to"" a representational work, regardless of any opinions they may have about its quality (Paragraph 2).  By contrast, with abstract works ""there are no broadly accessible grounds for judging their success or failure.  Nor is it always apparent what the purpose of such a work is"" (Paragraph 3).  Thus, the author argues that the purpose of abstract art requires justification, but the purpose of representational art is essentially taken for granted.  Accordingly, representational art is superior in this specific respect.
Therefore, the ""concrete"" advantage of representational art is that, unlike abstract works, it is easy for people to see the purpose of representational works.  Consequently, the assertion that representational art is ""if not objectively, then at least concretely"" superior to abstract art (Paragraph 1) is most likely meant to imply that while the value of any art can be questioned, there is a naturally accepted purpose to representation.
  (Choice A)  scholars should recognize the futility of promoting abstract art to the public.  Paragraph 1 describes ""the low opinion that the public at large has of abstract works and styles.""  However, the passage never suggests that promoting abstract works to the public is futile.  Rather, the author implies that the public's attitude might be changed, and offers recommendations for how art scholars can ""better convey the value of abstract works"" (Paragraph 5).
(Choice B)  unlike abstract art, representational art expresses an artist's meaning concretely.  Paragraph 2 implies that viewers may fail to perceive the meaning of representational art: ""ordinary viewers will generally see some purpose to the work whether or not they discern any deeper meaning.""  In addition, Paragraph 4 states that ""the difficulty with abstract art is not that ordinary viewers can find no meaning in it.""  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that representational art is superior in terms of the way in which an artist's meaning is expressed.
(Choice D)  the two types of art differ in terms of value rather than goals.  The author does not draw such a distinction between value and goals in the passage.  Moreover, the passage suggests that the two types of art do differ in terms of goals, as only representational art is intended to ""portray literal likenesses"" (Paragraph 1)."
"206","Which of the following statements best describes the main point of the passage?","A","37","For those of us whose careers are devoted to art, a common frustration is the low opinion that the public at large has of abstract works and styles....  Naturally, we in the art world would like to change this attitude, to better share what we recognize as valuable artistic experiences….  I think it behooves us to re-evaluate our perspective.  If we are committed to the idea that art is enriching to ordinary lives, we must take more seriously the question of why the popular preference exists. (Paragraph 1)
One advantage of representational art that abstract art often lacks is definite conditions for success.  To a significant degree, with representational works it is clear when an artist has done well….  Moreover, human beings have a natural desire to depict the world around us.  (Paragraph 2)
Thus, our frustrating cliché may reveal an important truth: the difficulty with abstract art is not that ordinary viewers can find no meaning in it.  Rather, there is no obvious reason why anyone other than the artist should care what that meaning is. (Paragraph 4)
This, then, is the issue that we as art scholars must address if we want to better convey the value of abstract works.  To explore this topic fully will require a more extensive treatment, but I would like to offer a starting point for reflection….  The task is to universalize: to make clear how an artist's vision is more than idiosyncratic, extending to the shared spaces of human experience. (Paragraph 5)
At both the beginning and the end of the passage, the author expresses the goal of encouraging ordinary people to appreciate abstract art.  For instance, Paragraph 1 mentions ""the low opinion that the public at large has of abstract works and styles,"" with the author asserting that ""we in the art world would like to change this attitude.""  He or she suggests that in order to accomplish such a change, art scholars must ""re-evaluate our perspective"" on ordinary views and ""take more seriously"" the reasons behind them.
The middle sections of the passage then address those reasons.  According to the author, a crucial difference between the two types of art is that there are ""definite conditions for success"" with representational works, relating to humans' ""natural desire to depict the world around us"" (Paragraph 2).  By contrast, abstract works lack this feature, leading to a perception that they have value only for the artist and not anyone else: ""there is no obvious reason why anyone other than the artist should care what [an abstract work's] meaning is"" (Paragraph 4).
Paragraph 5 identifies this perception as ""the issue that we as art scholars must address if we want to better convey the value of abstract works.""  Thus, the author returns to the goal from Paragraph 1, offering recommendations for changing ordinary people's attitudes toward abstract art.  He or she ultimately concludes that ""[t]he task is to universalize: to make clear how an artist's vision is more than idiosyncratic, extending to the shared spaces of human experience.""  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that for ordinary viewers to value abstract works, scholars must forge connections between such works and people's own experiences.
  (Choices B and D)  Representational art is superior to abstract art in at least one important respect; and Abstract works of art lack clearly identifiable conditions for judging their success or failure.  According to Paragraph 1, ""there is a sense in which…representational art is superior to abstract art.""  Paragraph 2 then specifies: ""One advantage of representational art that abstract art often lacks is definite conditions for success.""  Thus, these points relate to why most ordinary viewers prefer representational art over abstract art.  However, the main point of the passage concerns what ""we as art scholars"" should do in response to that preference, in order ""to better convey the value of abstract works"" (Paragraph 5).
(Choice C)  Representational art is generally preferred by most people over abstract art.  According to Paragraph 1, ""[t]he tendency for most people is to strongly prefer representational art, while mostly disdaining works that do not portray literal likenesses.""  However, the main point of the passage concerns how those in the art world could work ""to change this attitude, to better share what we recognize as valuable artistic experiences."""
"207","Based on the information in the passage, the author believes that his or her audience is largely:","B","37","For those of us whose careers are devoted to art, a common frustration is the low opinion that the public at large has of abstract works and styles.….  Naturally, we in the art world would like to change this attitude, to better share what we recognize as valuable artistic experiences.  Perhaps we even look down upon the public a little bit—smugly superior in the face of one more clichéd remark that ""a four-year-old could do that.""  I think it behooves us to re-evaluate our perspective.  If we are committed to the idea that art is enriching to ordinary lives, we must take more seriously the question of why the popular preference exists.  To begin with, we should make an admission: there is a sense in which—if not objectively, then at least concretely—representational art is superior to abstract art. (Paragraph 1)
Although that claim may seem shocking, the reasons behind it need to be acknowledged.  One advantage of representational art that abstract art often lacks is definite conditions for success. (Paragraph 2)
This, then, is the issue that we as art scholars must address if we want to better convey the value of abstract works. (Paragraph 5)
The author writes from the perspective of ""those of us whose careers are devoted to art"" (Paragraph 1) and appears to be directing his or her remarks to a similarly dedicated audience.  For instance, Paragraph 1 describes an attitude that ""we in the art world would like to change,"" and Paragraph 5 discusses ""the issue that we as art scholars must address.""  Thus, part of the author's argument concerns how his or her fellow art scholars are likely to react to passage claims.
In particular, the author refers to how such scholars view ordinary people's tendency to appreciate representational art but dislike abstract art.  In Paragraph 1, he or she suggests that ""we even look down upon the public a little bit"" for their preference, adding that ""we must take more seriously the question of why the popular preference exists.""  Furthermore, after suggesting there is a sense in which the ordinary view is justified, the author states: ""Although that claim may seem shocking, the reasons behind it need to be acknowledged"" (Paragraph 2).  Thus, the author implies that his or her audience is dismissive of ordinary people's views and needs to be convinced that those views deserve further consideration.
Therefore, based on the information in the passage, the author believes that his or her audience is largely biased against the passage idea that ordinary people's views may be reasonable.
  (Choice A)  skeptical of how the passage describes ordinary people's attitudes.  According to Paragraph 1, people in the art world share ""a common frustration"" regarding ""the low opinion that the public at large has of abstract works and styles.""  Similarly, the author suggests that ""we even look down on the public"" because of their ""clichéd"" reactions to such works.  Therefore, the author seems to assume the audience's agreement about how the passage describes ordinary people's attitudes.
(Choice C)  unsure of the passage claim that art is enriching to ordinary lives.  In Paragraph 1, the author discusses how ""we in the art world would like…to better share what we recognize as valuable artistic experiences.""  He or she later adds: ""If we are committed to the idea that art is enriching to ordinary lives, we must take more seriously the question of why the popular preference exists.""  Thus, the author implies that his or her audience does believe that art is enriching to ordinary lives.
(Choice D)  predisposed to favor the passage's recommendations for those in the art world.  In Paragraph 1, the author recommends that ""we in the art world"" should ""re-evaluate our perspective"" regarding ordinary views of art.  Similarly, after suggesting that the ordinary views might have some justification, he or she remarks that ""that claim may seem shocking"" (Paragraph 2).  Therefore, the author implies that his or her audience needs to be convinced to accept the passage's recommendations, not that the audience is predisposed to favor them."
"208","Why does the author most likely ""revisit the hypothetical four-year-old"" (Paragraph 4)?","C","37","Perhaps we even look down upon the public a little bit—smugly superior in the face of one more clichéd remark that ""a four-year-old could do that.""  I think it behooves us to re-evaluate our perspective.  If we are committed to the idea that art is enriching to ordinary lives, we must take more seriously the question of why the popular preference exists. (Paragraph 1)
To a curator, an untitled Joan Mitchell canvas may be a ""bold departure from traditional forms"" warranting serious contemplation.  But to museum visitors, it may be an indistinct hodgepodge warranting only a brief glance en route to paintings with recognizable subjects. (Paragraph 3)
To see why, let us revisit the hypothetical four-year-old.  When a child produces art, we likely judge the production as beneficial to her: she has expressed herself, exercised creativity, and so on.  But there is little reason to think that anyone else (save perhaps her parents or teacher) should find her work important.  Thus, our frustrating cliché may reveal an important truth: the difficulty with abstract art is not that ordinary viewers can find no meaning in it.  Rather, there is no obvious reason why anyone other than the artist should care what that meaning is. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 1 describes a ""clichéd"" response to abstract works of art in which people claim that ""'a four-year-old could do that.'""  Although people in the art world look down on this attitude, the author suggests that they should ""take more seriously the question of why"" this reaction is so common.  Thus, he or she later revisits this idea in discussing the public's tendency to be unimpressed by abstract works.  After suggesting that most viewers would ignore an abstract painting in favor of ""paintings with recognizable subjects"" (Paragraph 3), the author writes: ""To see why, let us revisit the hypothetical four-year-old"" (Paragraph 4).
Specifically, abstract works may seem similar to the works of young children in terms of how their meaning is perceived by observers.  For instance, when a child produces an artwork, ""she has expressed herself, exercised creativity, and so on.  But there is little reason to think that anyone else…should find her work important"" (Paragraph 4).  Similarly, if an abstract work does not concern ""recognizable subjects"" (Paragraph 3), there may be nothing to connect it to a viewer's experience.  Hence, while it may express the artist's personal ideas, there would be ""no obvious reason why anyone other than the artist should care what [the work's] meaning is"" (Paragraph 4).
Therefore, the author most likely decides to ""revisit the hypothetical four-year-old"" to help clarify why abstract art is often underappreciated.
  (Choice A)  to demonstrate the clichéd nature of a common reaction to abstract styles.  According to Paragraph 4, ""our frustrating cliché may reveal an important truth"" about abstract art.  Therefore, the author's choice to ""revisit the hypothetical four-year-old"" is not meant to demonstrate the clichéd nature of the common reaction, but to explain why abstract works lead to such a reaction in the first place.
(Choice B)  to help explain why the general public dislikes works by Joan Mitchell.  Paragraph 3 refers to ""an untitled Joan Mitchell canvas"" as an example of art that professional scholars may find impressive but that the general public would likely ignore.  However, the author uses this example to make a claim about perceptions of abstract art as a whole: ""The problem is not necessarily a perception that abstract works lack meaning—the real issue is more subtle.""  Therefore, the suggestion to ""revisit the hypothetical four-year-old"" (Paragraph 4) is not meant to explain an attitude toward Joan Mitchell works specifically, but to make a broader observation about how people perceive abstract art.
(Choice D)  to describe why abstract works have less value than representational ones.  The author's aim in the passage is to help promote the value of abstract works of art.  For instance, Paragraph 1 refers to such works as ""valuable artistic experiences,"" and Paragraph 5 expresses the goal of ""better convey[ing] the value of abstract works.""  Therefore, although revisiting the hypothetical four-year-old helps explain why most ordinary viewers prefer representational works, the author does not argue that abstract works have less value than representational ones."
"209","Which of the following works would be an example of ""representational art"" as the author uses the term?","A","37","For those of us whose careers are devoted to art, a common frustration is the low opinion that the public at large has of abstract works and styles.  The tendency for most people is to strongly prefer representational art, while mostly disdaining works that do not portray literal likenesses. (Paragraph 1)
To a significant degree, with representational works it is clear when an artist has done well: if an object or person has been accurately portrayed, anyone can see that something skillful has been accomplished.  Moreover, human beings have a natural desire to depict the world around us. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 1, works of art are ""representational"" when they ""portray literal likenesses.""  Similarly, Paragraph 2 conveys that the goal of representational art is for ""an object or person [to be] accurately portrayed.""  Therefore, the author uses the term ""representational art"" to refer to works that realistically depict how beings or objects appear in the world.
Similarly, a painting of animals as they appear from a ground-level vantage point would illustrate how the animals literally appear from a given perspective.  Consequently, such a work would be an example of ""representational art"" as the author uses the term.
  By contrast, none of the following works is an example of ""representational art"" as the author uses the term:
A painting portraying animals as collections of geometric shapes (Choice B).  Portraying animals as collections of geometric shapes would leave out specific details of the animals' physical appearance.  Accordingly, such a depiction would not yield ""literal likenesses"" of the animals (Paragraph 1).
A painting of animals that represent the artist's hidden fears (Choice C).  In this context, the animals would ""represent"" the artist's fears in a symbolic way, not a literal one (ie, the animals' physical appearance would not literally resemble the emotion of fear).  By contrast, the author uses the term ""representational"" to refer to art that depicts the visible appearance of a being or object.
A still life that depicts common objects from multiple perspectives at once (Choice D).  In the natural world, objects are only viewed from a single perspective at a time.  Therefore, depicting objects from multiple perspectives at once would not exemplify ""representational art"" as the author uses the term."
"210","In one episode of a 1981 TV show, an art critic praises a painting of a single circle, stating that it ""reduces experience to its most elemental aesthetic"" and is ""quite profound in its simplicity.""  This scenario best supports the assertion that:","A","37","A typical skepticism toward art analysis stems from the impression that it is characterized by trickery or puffery of some sort.  The average viewer sees little of note in a given work, but is assured of its great significance by a member of the intellectual elite; if only the viewer understood art, he would perceive the work's many virtues….  We must dispel this misconception.  The task is to universalize: to make clear how an artist's vision is more than idiosyncratic, extending to the shared spaces of human experience. (Paragraph 5)
In Paragraph 5, the author discusses a common negative perception of art analysis.  Many people perceive such analysis as making implausible, grandiose claims about art that is actually unimpressive: ""The average viewer sees little of note in a given work but is assured of its great significance by a member of the intellectual elite; if only the viewer understood art, he would perceive the work's many virtues.""
Similarly, an art critic who praises a painting of a single circle could easily be seen as exemplifying such a tendency toward implausible and grandiose claims.  By describing how supposedly ""profound"" such a simplistic painting is, the critic contributes to the perception that art analysis is ""characterized by trickery or puffery of some sort"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, this scenario best supports the assertion that art analysis is often viewed with skepticism because it can seem pretentious or phony.
  By contrast, this scenario would not best support the assertion that:
an abstract work may seem like ""an indistinct hodgepodge"" that is difficult to make sense of (Choice B).  Although the painting of the circle is presumably meant to be abstract, it would not constitute ""an indistinct hodgepodge (confusing jumble)"" (Paragraph 3).  Rather, a single circle would be a distinct, easily identifiable shape.
those in the art world are often frustrated by ordinary people's views of abstract works (Choice C).  Paragraph 1 states that ""[f]or those of us whose careers are devoted to art, a common frustration is the low opinion that the public at large has of abstract works and styles.""  However, in the given scenario, the art critic does not express any attitudes about ordinary people's opinions; rather, he simply praises the painting.
with representational art it is generally clear when an artist has done well (Choice D).  By claiming that the painting is ""quite profound in its simplicity,"" the art critic highlights the supposedly deep significance of the painting, not the artist's accuracy in depicting a circle.  Hence, the scenario does not exemplify the ease of determining when ""an object or person has been accurately portrayed"" (Paragraph 2)."
"211","The poem based on Munch's diary entry is most likely incorporated into the passage (Paragraph 2) to:","C","38","In a poem based on an 1892 diary entry, Munch relates the genesis of what would become his most celebrated work.  He was walking across a bridge with two friends in the vicinity of Ekeberg Hill, overlooking Oslo, when ""…the sun was setting—suddenly the sky turned blood-red—I paused, feeling exhausted, and leaned on the fence—there was blood and tongues of fire above the blue-black fjord and the city––my friends walked on and I stood there trembling with anxiety—and I sensed an infinite Scream passing through nature."" (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 quotes Munch's ""poem based on an 1892 diary entry"" describing ""the genesis (origin or beginning) of his most celebrated work,"" namely, the moment when he ""'sensed an infinite Scream passing through nature.'""  Consequently, the author most likely incorporated this poem into the passage in order to depict the circumstances surrounding the artwork's conception (origin).
By contrast, it is unlikely that the author incorporated the poem into the passage in order to:
show that an artist can use a short-lived moment as a stimulus for a permanent work of art (Choice A).  In Paragraph 2, the author explicitly states that Munch's poem ""relates the genesis"" of The Scream, indicating that this is the purpose of the poem's inclusion in the passage.  Therefore, describing the short-lived moment when the artist ""'sensed an infinite Scream'"" serves to depict how the painting came into being (ie, its conception or origin) rather than to show how a particular moment might become a stimulus for a permanent work of art.
portray Munch as a writer (Choice B).  Paragraph 2 quotes a poem Munch wrote ""based on an 1892 diary entry"" about his personal experience when he ""'sensed an infinite Scream passing through nature.'""  However, the passage makes no further mention of Munch's poetry or writing, nor does it ever identify Munch as a writer.
show the appeal of Munch's paintings (Choice D).  As Paragraph 2 makes clear, the poem based on the diary entry relates an experience of Munch's that served as ""the genesis "" of The Scream.  However, although the content of this poem might prove useful for understanding the appeal of this painting, it reveals nothing about Munch's other paintings or their appeal."
"212","The passage suggests that a work of art is most relatable if it:","B","38","Nevertheless, as art curator Martha Tedeschi asserts, The Scream is one of only a handful of paintings in the history of art able to ""communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer""; its primitive character transmits a raw emotionality and subjectivity.  Unsurprisingly, then, the painting has over-spilt the bounds of traditional art to become an icon of popular culture. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 quotes Tedeschi's claim that The Scream is ""only one of a handful of paintings…able to 'communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer.'""  It can therefore be inferred that the author believes that exuding (radiating) universal appeal is what makes a work of art most relatable—that is, easy for people to relate to or find meaning in.
By contrast, the passage does not suggest that a work of art is most relatable if it:
combines popular styles (Choice A).  Paragraph 4 states that when painting The Scream, Munch was ""[i]nfluenced by luminaries (prominent individuals) such as the impressionist painter Monet and the more deeply expressive Van Gogh.""  Although this evidence shows that Munch did combine popular artistic styles, the passage does not suggest that combining styles was essential to making this work, or any artwork, easy for people to relate to.
embodies the mood of the times (Choice C).  Paragraph 4 states that ""The Scream aptly captured both the self-indulgence (decline and excess) and despair characterizing the turn of the twentieth century at the same time that it heralded the existential angst (deep anxiety or dread) of the mid-century.""  However, Paragraph 5 explains that The Scream can ""'communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer,'"" showing that it also exemplifies an artwork that is easy for viewers from many different time periods to relate to.
portrays its subject realistically (Choice D).  Paragraph 3 describes the main figure in The Scream as being ""ill-defined and ghostlike...against the menacing background of a bloodshot sky.""  Such a description demonstrates that The Scream portrays its subject unrealistically."
"213","Which of the following best represents the author's primary concern in the passage?","A","38","…Edvard Munch's instantly identifiable painting…The Scream, destabilizes the very concept of a work of art as discrete and unique…[and] constitutes not a single but a multiplicitous work. (Paragraph 1)
…Munch's free-form style, vivid colors, and striking juxtapositions mark this work as avant-garde. (Paragraph 4)
The Scream is one of only a handful of paintings in the history of art able to ""communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer""…. [T]he painting has over-spilt the bounds of traditional art to become an icon of popular culture. (Paragraph 5)
Ironically, however, it is the ""single"" provocative image of The Scream that, as both masterpiece and pop icon, has eclipsed all this artist's other works. (Paragraph 7)
According to Paragraph 1, The Scream is ""instantly identifiable"" (ie, indicating popularity) but deviates from ""the very concept of a work of art as discrete (separate and distinct) and unique"" because it boasts multiple versions and was ""conceived of…not as a freestanding piece"" of art.  Moreover, in Paragraph 4, the painting's ""free-form style, vivid colors, and striking juxtapositions"" are labeled ""avant-garde (unusual or innovative).""
Paragraph 5 discusses how The Scream has ""become an icon of popular culture,"" and Paragraph 6 relates two ""unusual thefts"" of the painting that have added to its notoriety.  Lastly, Paragraph 7 claims that, due to its popularity, The Scream ""has eclipsed all this artist's other works.""
Consequently, the main concern of the passage is to consider aspects of a work of art that may have contributed to its unusualness and popularity.
By contrast, the following do not represent the passage's main concern:
To provide evidence that artists with many works are more successful than those with fewer works (Choice B).  Paragraph 7 shows that despite being a ""remarkably prolific (productive) painter,"" Munch is mostly famous for just a single work, The Scream.  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that an artist's success is directly connected to the quantity of his or her work.
To support increased opportunities for artists to express their personal experiences in their work (Choice C).  Paragraph 3 describes The Scream as ""the artistic consequence"" of Munch's ""terrifying epiphany""—that is, his personal experience.  Although the painting therefore constitutes an example of artwork based on personal experience, the passage neither discusses nor supports more opportunities for artists to express their personal experiences in their work.
To show how the existence of multiple versions affects the value of a particular work (Choice D).  Paragraph 1 describes The Scream as ""[b]oasting two versions in pastel and two in oil"" and as ""arguably constitut[ing] not a single but a multiplicitous work.""  However, the passage never associates multiple versions of a work with its artistic or material value."
"214","The author's probable motive in mentioning the thieves' postcard message is to show that:","A","38","In an almost comical heist, two men employed a ladder to easily access a second-story window and abscond with the painting, taking the time to leave a postcard that read, ""Thanks for the poor security.""  Then, in 2004, robbers entered Oslo's Munch Museum in broad daylight, intimidated museum guards with firearms, and used a wire cutter to extract another version of The Scream from the wall along with Munch's Madonna painting. (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 6 relates that when a version of The Scream was stolen in 1994, the thieves ""[took] the time to leave a postcard that read, 'Thanks for the poor security.'""  The inclusion of this detail adds humor to the narrative but, more importantly, also shows how the thieves wished to underscore (emphasize) the ease with which they were able to abscond (escape or flee) with this famous painting.  This inference is further supported by the stark contrast with the second theft, in which thieves ""intimidated museum guards with firearms"" in order to seize the painting (Paragraph 6).
By contrast, the author's probable motive for mentioning the postcard message was not to show that:
complicated methods were used to steal the painting (Choice B).  Paragraph 6 relays how ""two men employed a ladder to easily access a second-story window and abscond with the painting.""  This description of the heist (robbery) makes it clear that the methods used to steal The Scream were not complicated but simple and easy, requiring only a ladder.
the thieves' commentary did not hinder accomplishment of the theft (Choice C).  Leaving behind the postcard did not hinder the accomplishment of the theft but did serve to underscore its unusual ease.
the thieves' plan to bypass security was very carefully organized (Choice D).  Paragraph 6 states that the thieves used a ladder ""to easily access a second-story window and abscond with the painting.""  This information indicates that their theft of The Scream was simple, but not necessarily that they had a carefully organized plan to bypass security.  The thieves left the postcard message behind because there was an obvious lack of security that made the theft unusually easy."
"215","In the context of the passage, the word kitsch can most accurately be defined as:","B","38","Wildly appropriated and often misused, the image—through which Munch purported to be doing nothing less than studying his own soul—has appeared on everything from keychains to dormitory posters and is in danger of becoming kitsch. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 describes how The Scream has turned into ""an icon of popular culture"": the image has been ""mass-produced,"" ""wildly appropriated,"" and ""often misused,"" appearing on ""everything from keychains to dormitory posters,"" and therefore ""in danger of becoming kitsch.""
Overall, Paragraph 5 emphasizes that the image of The Scream has been trivialized and its status as art diminished through uses that could be judged as in poor taste.  It even implies that these treatments of the image have degraded Munch's stated artistic intention in creating The Scream of ""studying his own soul.""  Consequently, in the context of the passage, the word kitsch could most accurately be defined as tasteless art.
By contrast, the following definitions do not accurately define the word kitsch as it is used in the context of the passage:
lofty style (Choice A).  Paragraph 5 refers to the image as being ""wildly appropriated,"" ""misused,"" and ""in danger of becoming kitsch.""  A lofty style (ie, a positive, elevated, and tasteful presentation) would constitute the opposite of these negative treatments.
cheap workmanship (Choice C).  Paragraph 5 clearly states that it is the ""misuse"" and wild appropriation of the image itself rather than the workmanship (mechanical skill) invested in its reproduction that puts it ""in danger of becoming kitsch.""
playful imitation (Choice D).  Paragraph 5 discusses how the ""misuse"" of the image of The Scream has put it ""in danger of becoming kitsch.""  However, a playful imitation of an artistic image would not necessarily constitute a misuse of the image; for example, it could represent a meaningful parody of the original work or an homage."
"216","Suppose that the majority of artists prefer to create several versions of a work.  How would this correspond to the ideas about art presented in the passage?","B","38","Norwegian artist Edvard Munch's instantly identifiable painting Der Schrei der Natur or, more simply, The Scream, destabilizes the very concept of a work of art as discrete and unique.  Boasting two versions in pastel and two in oil as well as a lithograph—all generated between 1893 and 1910—Munch's masterpiece arguably constitutes not a single but a multiplicitous work.  Moreover, Munch originally conceived of the painting not as a freestanding piece, but as part of a more ambitious project called the Frieze of Life. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 identifies ""the very concept of a work of art"" as something ""discrete (ie, separate and distinct) and unique,"" in contrast to The Scream, which boasts ""two versions in pastel and two in oil as well as a lithograph (a type of print).""  Consequently, finding out that the majority of artists actually prefer to create several versions rather than just one version of a work would weaken the passage contention that the standard work of art is singular and separate.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 1 states that the typical work of art is ""discrete and unique"" and then holds up Munch's painting The Scream as unusual because it is ""multiplicitous"" and does not embody these qualities.  Paragraph 1 also implies that The Scream is unusual because it was not created as a ""freestanding piece"" of art.  Therefore, if the majority of artists prefer to create several versions of a work, this finding would weaken rather than strengthen the passage contention that The Scream is an unusual work of art.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 5 relates that, according to art curator Martha Tedeschi, ""The Scream is one of only a handful of paintings in the history of art able to 'communicate a specific meaning almost immediately to almost every viewer.'""  Although this assertion implies that only a few paintings have universal appeal, it does not draw a connection between an artwork's multiplicity and its appeal.  Therefore, if the majority of artists prefer to create several versions of a work, this finding would be irrelevant to the passage inference that only a few paintings possess such universal appeal.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 1 relates how Munch created a work of art that boasted ""two versions in pastel and two in oil as well as a lithograph"" and ""arguably constitute[d] not a single but a multiplicitous work.""  Therefore, the idea that artists prefer to express the same artistic vision in slightly different forms would strengthen rather than weaken the passage inference that there can be more than one version of an artistic vision."
"217","Why does the author most likely introduce the topic of the Victorian Internet by discussing the sociological conditions prevalent between 1820 and 1914?","C","39","Lasting roughly from 1820 to 1914, the Victorian Era is often defined by its many distinctive sociological conditions, including industrialization, urbanization, railroad travel, imperialism, territorial expansionism, and the frictions sparked by Darwinism and democratic reform.  However, descriptors that may not come as readily to mind are ""the Information Age"" and ""the Age of Communication""; nor would we likely associate this era with something called the ""highway of thought,"" which emanated from the electric telegraph—an invention that, in retrospect, could be renamed ""the Victorian Internet.""  Yet the rise of the electric telegraph in the mid-1800s constituted the greatest revolution in communication since the invention of the printing press in the fifteenth century and until the launch of the World Wide Web at the end of the twentieth century. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 attempts to show the popular view of the Victorian Era.  The author describes it as ""often defined by its many distinctive sociological conditions, including industrialization, urbanization, railroad travel, imperialism, territorial expansionism, and the frictions sparked by Darwinism and democratic reform.""  The author then stresses that the Victorian Era is not typically thought of as ""'the Information Age' and 'the Age of Communication,'"" nor is the telegraph commonly recognized as ""an invention that…could be renamed 'the Victorian Internet.'""  He or she also emphasizes that ""the rise of the electric telegraph…constituted the greatest revolution in communication"" since the printing press and before the World Wide Web.
Accordingly, the author shows that, although the telegraph had a dramatic impact, Victorian society had already experienced a series of cultural upheavals and technological innovations by the time telegraphic communication arose.  As people are more likely to associate the Victorian Era with those other dramatic changes, the impact of the telegraph often goes unacknowledged.  Therefore, the most likely reason the author introduces the topic of the Victorian Internet by discussing the sociological conditions prevalent between 1820 and 1914 is to suggest that the many other dramatic changes of the period cause people to overlook the telegraph's impact.
 (Choices A and B)  To explore the details of an era of change leading to the inevitable development of the telegraph; and To reveal the socioeconomic factors that made improvements in communication possible.  Paragraph 1 lists many of the significant changes that occurred during the Victorian Era, including ""industrialization, urbanization, railroad travel, imperialism, [and] territorial expansionism,"" as well as ""the frictions sparked by Darwinism and democratic reform.""  The author then describes the development of the telegraph as another dramatic but often unrecognized change during this era.  However, he or she never provides any information to suggest that the telegraph's development was an inevitable result of the other changes that took place.  Furthermore, the author never suggests that the rise of the telegraph, or other improvements in communication, was made possible by the given socioeconomic factors.
(Choice D)  To overcome the notion of the telegraph as a phenomenon that transcended its time.  In referring to telegraphic communication as ""the greatest revolution in communication since…the printing press in the fifteenth century and…the World Wide Web at the end of the twentieth century"" (Paragraph 1), the author connects the telegraph system with both a past and a future system of dramatically accelerated communication.  Accordingly, the passage does not present the telegraph as a phenomenon entirely embedded in the specific sociological conditions of the Victorian Era; instead, it is revealed to be another transformative and highly influential communication revolution in world history.  Thus, the author likely discusses the sociological conditions prevalent at the time in order to support rather than to overcome the notion of the telegraph as transcending its time."
"218","Based on the passage, the comparison between Victorian and modern online subcultures suggests:","A","39","A new type of skilled worker, the telegrapher, was born.  He or she belonged to a vast, online community, whose semi-anonymous members shared a unique intermediary role as well as a language of dots and dashes—vaguely prefiguring the exchange of bits and bytes along modern computer networks.  Like today's online communities, these telegraphers fostered their own subculture: jokes and anecdotes flew over the wires; some operators invented systems to play games, and occasional romances blossomed.  Regrettably, hackers, scammers, and shady entrepreneurs also frequented the byways of this early internet. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, ""the telegrapher…belonged to a vast, online community"" of individuals who remained largely unknown but ""shared a language of dots and dashes—vaguely prefiguring the exchange of bits and bytes along today's computer networks.""  The author further explains how ""these telegraphers fostered their own subculture,"" which was like a modern online community: ""[J]okes and anecdotes flew over the wires; some operators invented systems to play games, and occasional romances blossomed.""  As with today's internet, there were also ""hackers, scammers, and shady entrepreneurs.""
Accordingly, despite the vast differences between the culture of the Victorian Era and that of the twenty-first century, the passage suggests that their respective communication systems led to similar shared online experiences and so to the development of comparable subcultures.  Therefore, based on the passage, the comparison between Victorian and modern online subcultures suggests that that even when two cultures are distinct, their online subcultures tend to be similar.
 (Choice B)  that the development of a subculture is the most significant effect of online communication.  Paragraph 3 focuses on the profound socioeconomic consequences of telegraphic communication such as ""'an irreversible acceleration in the pace of business life.'""  In Paragraph 4, the author also notes that an online subculture of telegraphers, ""whose semi-anonymous members shared a unique intermediary role as well as a language of dots and dashes,"" developed.  However, in comparison with the socioeconomic effect, the author seems to view the development of such a subculture as an interesting and inevitable (but not particularly significant) effect of telegraphic communication, similar to the development of today's online internet communities.
(Choice C)  that an online subculture is defined solely by a shared language.  In Paragraph 4, the author describes ""the vast, online community"" of Victorian telegraphers as ""semi-anonymous"" and sharing ""a unique intermediary role as well as a language of dots and dashes.""  Thus, while the author implies that a shared language is essential to defining this online subculture, he or she also mentions shared status and a role.  The author then goes on to compare the telegraph subculture to ""today's online communities,"" describing various activities characteristic of both: ""[J]okes and anecdotes flew over the wires; some operators invented systems to play games, and occasional romances blossomed.""  Accordingly, the passage does not suggest that an online subculture is defined solely by a shared language.
(Choice D)  that the transmission of messages cannot be trusted due to online criminal activity.  According to Paragraph 4, telegraphers formed ""a vast, online community"" with its own subculture.  The author then points out that ""hackers, scammers, and shady entrepreneurs also frequented the byways of this early internet.""  Thus, some illicit activity was being conducted on the Victorian Internet, as it is on today's internet.  However, the passage emphasizes that the telegraph sparked dramatic changes in communication and business, suggesting that, despite some criminal activity, online transmission of messages could generally be trusted."
"219","Given passage information, which of the following assertions most aptly describes how the economic climate of the Victorian Era was transformed as a result of the telegraph?","B","39","Following some spectacular failures, a durable cable was stretched across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, enabling Europe and the U.S. to exchange messages within minutes.  In the 1870s, the British Empire connected London with outposts in India and Australia.  While individual telegram speed remained relatively constant, an endless deluge of information began to pour through the wires.  There was, as Tom Standage observes, ""an irreversible acceleration in the pace of business life,"" reflecting how ""telegraphy and commerce thrived in a virtuous circle.""  It was as though ""rapid long-distance communication had effectively obliterated time and space,"" begetting the phenomenon known as ""globalization."" (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 outlines how foreign communications and, thus, commerce increased as telegraphic networks were expanded: ""a durable cable was stretched across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, enabling Europe and the U.S. to exchange messages within minutes.  In the 1870s, the British Empire connected London with outposts in India and Australia.""  As a result of this expansion, ""an endless deluge of information poured through the wires,"" triggering ""'an irreversible acceleration in the pace of business life.'""  Hence, telegraphy and commerce were mutually reinforced.  Overall, the impact of these changes was so profound it seemed that the telegraph ""'had effectively obliterated time and space.'""
Accordingly, as overseas communication irreversibly increased, businesses evolved in response to the new ""'rapid long-distance communication'"" and its effects.  Therefore, as a result of the transformation wrought by the telegraph, the economic climate during the Victorian Era adapted to an acceleration of foreign communications.
 (Choice A)  It adapted to regulations controlling the pace of business.  Paragraph 3 states that after the expansion of both the domestic and foreign telegraph networks, there was ""'an irreversible acceleration in the pace of business life,'"" and telegraphy and commerce mutually thrived.  However, the passage never mentions any regulations designed to control the increased pace of business after the telegraph came into wide commercial use.
(Choices C and D)  It adapted to an increase in the localization of markets; and It adapted to a reduction in domestic trade deals.  According to Paragraph 3, when the transatlantic cable was installed, it enabled ""Europe and the U.S. to exchange messages within minutes.""  In addition, the distant parts of the British Empire were connected with London.  As a result of this telegraph expansion, ""an endless deluge of information poured through the wires.""  Moreover, ""there was…'an irreversible acceleration in the pace of business life,'"" as telegraphy and commerce reinforced each other.  According to the passage, ""'[R]apid long-distance communication…obliterated time and space,' begetting the modern phenomenon known as 'globalization.'""  Thus, during the Victorian Era, the economic climate had to adapt to an increase in the globalization, not the localization, of markets due to the rise of the telegraph.  However, although the passage indicates an increase in international trade, it never suggests that there was a corresponding reduction in domestic trade deals."
"220","In the last paragraph, the author compares telegrams with text messages.  Based on this comparison, the author considers the telegram to be a communication mode that was:","B","39","Predictably, newer forms of the original telegraphic technology—first the telephone and, much later, the fax machine—eventually encroached.  The last telegram departed from India in 2013, but the twenty-first century has arguably seen a revival of this communication form in the text message.  As Standage claims, texting has not only ""reincarnate[d] a defunct nineteenth-century technology"" but reinforced ""the democratization of telecommunications"" inaugurated by the miraculous Victorian Internet. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, ""[T]he twenty-first century has arguably seen a revival of this communication form in the text message.""  The author then cites Tom Standage's claim that texting has not only brought back to life a nineteenth century form of technology but ""reinforced 'the democratization of telecommunications'"" begun with ""the miraculous Victorian Internet.""  The term ""democratization"" strongly implies that the telegram was widely available in its time, offering many members of Victorian society the chance to use this form of fast long-distance communication.
Accordingly, the author indicates that, as with text messaging today, the telegram in the Victorian Era was a mode of communication readily available to most of the general population.  Therefore, based on the comparison between telegrams and text messages in the last paragraph, the author considers the telegram to be a mode of communication that was commonplace.
 By contrast, the author does not consider the telegram to be a mode of communication that was:
elitist (Choice A).  Paragraph 5 cites Standage's claim that ""texting…reinforced 'the democratization of telecommunications'"" brought about by ""the miraculous Victorian Internet.""  To the extent that the telegram was democratic or generally available to the masses, it could not be considered elitist—that is, available to only a select few.
overrated (Choice C).  The rapid transmission of long-distance messages or telegrams represented a new technology in the nineteenth century that the author describes as ""the greatest revolution in communication since the invention of the printing press"" (Paragraph 1).  Likewise, in Paragraph 5, he or she calls the electric telegraph or Victorian Internet ""miraculous.""  Accordingly, the author stresses that in its time the telegraph was an extraordinary phenomenon rather than something overrated.
unique (Choice D).  Paragraph 5 states that ""[p]redictably, newer forms of the original telegraphic technology—first the telephone and, much later, the fax machine—eventually encroached.""  Having noted that the last telegram was sent in 2013, the author points out ""the revival of this communication form in the text message.""  Thus, the similarity between the telegram and the text message suggests that the author does not view the telegram as a unique form of communication, but as one that has been subject to imitation and has generated analogues."
"221","Which of the following statements is implied by passage information?","D","39","Within 20 years, telegraph cables crisscrossed the continental U.S. and much of Europe....  Following some spectacular failures, a durable cable was stretched across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, enabling Europe and the U.S. to exchange messages within minutes.  In the 1870s, the British Empire connected London with outposts in India and Australia.  While individual telegram speed remained relatively constant, an endless deluge of information began to pour through the wires.  There was, as Tom Standage observes, ""an irreversible acceleration in the pace of business life,"" reflecting how ""telegraphy and commerce thrived in a virtuous circle.""  It was as though ""rapid long-distance communication had effectively obliterated time and space,"" begetting the phenomenon known as ""globalization."" (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 tracks the overseas expansion of the telegraph over the three decades that followed its invention: ""telegraph cables crisscrossed…much of Europe,"" and ""a durable cable was stretched across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, enabling Europe and the U.S. to exchange messages within minutes.""  Furthermore, ""In the 1870s, the British Empire connected London with outposts in India and Australia.""  As a result of this expansion, ""an endless deluge of information poured through the wires,"" triggering ""'an irreversible acceleration in the pace of business life.'""  Thus, in Europe (and elsewhere) telegraphy and commerce mutually thrived.
Accordingly, passage information implies that the markets in Europe depended on both continental and overseas ""'rapid long-distance communication'"" (Paragraph 3), enabled by the newly expanded telegraph system.  Therefore, passage information implies that European markets became heavily dominated by telegraphic communication.
 By contrast, passage information does not imply that:
the transatlantic telegraph system provided less reliable service than the domestic system (Choice A).  Paragraph 3 states that ""[f]ollowing some spectacular failures, a durable cable was stretched across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean, enabling Europe and the U.S. to exchange messages within minutes.""  However, even though the transatlantic telegraph system had proven difficult to install, the passage never suggests that it provided less reliable service than the domestic system.
the telegraph can be considered an essentially American invention (Choice B).  Paragraph 2 outlines the invention of the telegraph: ""After countless attempts by scientists to use electricity to transmit messages, innovators in both Britain and America…worked at harnessing electromagnetic forces to send communications via cable.""  The passage then conveys the difference that American efforts ""culminated in the transmission of a message along a 40-mile telegraphic wire…while in Britain the technology was initially reserved for railway signaling.""  Thus, the passage maintains that the British invented the telegraph at the same time as the U.S., even though they initially used it for a different purpose.
the speed of the typical telegram was continually increasing (Choice C).  Paragraph 3 describes how telegraph networks expanded and telegraphic communication accelerated with the installation of overseas cables after 1870.  However, the author distinguishes how, ""[w]hile individual telegram speed remained relatively constant, an endless deluge of information began to pour through the wires.""  Consequently, although the passage implies a great increase both in the distance that telegrams could travel and in the overall volume of telegraphic transmissions, it does not specify that there was a corresponding increase in the speed of the typical telegram."
"222","Leach's critique of Frazer (Paragraph 4) is based on:
concerns about methodology
the importance of fieldwork
opposition to a comparative approach","B","40","Leach gazed backward upon The Golden Bough as a target rather than a benchmark.  While acknowledging Frazer's legendary status as ""a colossus in the history of English scholarship,"" Leach nevertheless attacked him as a plagiarist, distortionist, and popularizer.  In a particularly scathing critique entitled ""Golden Bough or Gilded Twig?"" he condemned his predecessor's ""artistic license,"" alleging that he routinely embellished sources and twisted information to support preformulated theories.  According to Leach, Frazer relied shamelessly on secondhand material culled from missionaries and imperial officials rather than on his own interactions with native peoples.  Moreover, many of his comparisons of myths seemed based solely on superficial resemblances between just a few elements.  Lastly, Leach joined in decrying what critics termed Frazer's ""misapplication of Darwin's theory of biological evolution to human history and psychology"" that depicted cultures as progressing through predictable stages from belief in magic to belief in religion, and, finally, in science. (Paragraph 4)
The passage presents Edmund Leach's view that the methods Frazer used in his voluminous The Golden Bough were fundamentally flawed.  According to Paragraph 4, Leach attacked Frazer ""as a plagiarist, distortionist, and popularizer.""  He denounced Frazer's"" 'artistic license,' alleging that he routinely embellished sources and twisted information to support preformulated theories.""  Leach also claimed that ""Frazer relied shamelessly on secondhand material"" and that ""many of his comparisons of myths were based solely on superficial resemblances between just a few elements.""  Furthermore, Paragraph 4 notes that Leach was among those who scorned ""Frazer's 'misapplication of Darwin's theory of biological evolution to human history and psychology,'"" which maintained that cultures advanced ""through predictable stages.""  Therefore, according to the passage, Leach's critique of Frazer is based on concerns about methodology (Number I).
The passage indicates that Leach saw fieldwork, which would yield firsthand information, as an essential part of anthropological research.  He emphasized that ""Frazer relied shamelessly on secondhand material culled (gathered) from missionaries and imperial officials rather than on his own interactions with native peoples"" (Paragraph 4).  Consequently, Leach's critique of Frazer is based in part on the importance of fieldwork to anthropological writings (Number II).
(Number III)  Paragraph 4 cites Leach's criticism that ""many of [Frazer's] comparisons of myths were based solely on superficial resemblances between just a few elements.""  Accordingly, he believed that Frazer's comparisons were not drawn from sufficient evidence.  Thus, Leach's criticism is directed at Frazer's resistance to gathering firsthand evidence when applying a comparative approach rather than at such an approach itself.  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that Leach's critique of Frazer is based on opposition to a comparative approach."
"223","The passage implies that Frazer's work was popular because:","A","40","An instantaneous bestseller when it appeared in 1890, Sir James Frazer's The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion was…considered controversial….  While the book's overwhelming popularity assured its place in posterity, the changing face of science and the further emergence of anthropology as a discipline meant it would end up as reviled as it was revered….  [A]t best it was exalted as a dazzling display of erudition packaged in poetic prose.  Moreover, as a rare example of adventure tale, travelogue, and detective story rolled into one, The Golden Bough was enormously entertaining to read. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 describes Frazer's The Golden Bough as divergent in several significant ways.  It was considered ""controversial"" within the field of anthropology, largely because of its flawed methodologies and lack of fieldwork.  Nevertheless, Frazer's text turned out to be ""an instantaneous bestseller.""  It is described as ""a dazzling display of erudition (learnedness) packaged in poetic prose.""  More specifically, the passage author calls it ""a rare example of adventure tale, travelogue, and detective story rolled into one"" and, as such, ""enormously entertaining to read.""
These descriptions suggest that Frazer's work featured a unique and interesting combination of diverse qualities one would not expect to find in an anthropological text but that gave it a distinctly literary appeal and accounted for its ""overwhelming popularity.""  Therefore, the passage implies that Frazer's work was popular because it diverged from the more scientific presentation of some anthropological works.
 By contrast, the passage does not imply that Frazer's work was popular because:
it promoted the notion that wisdom can be conveyed through myth (Choice B).  Paragraph 2 describes The Golden Bough as a ""vast compendium of myth and ritual"" that ""emphasized the striking similarities in myths across cultures and time periods.""  Thus, Frazer's work suggests that many societies share conceptions about important aspects of life.  Accordingly, one might suppose the common elements in those myths conveyed wisdom.  However, the passage never indicates that Frazer's work promoted the notion that wisdom can be conveyed through myth.
it enabled the reader to achieve a deep understanding of a particular culture (Choice C).  Frazer's work is described as ""a vast compendium of myth and ritual"" with an emphasis on ""the striking similarities found in myths across cultures and time periods.""  As such, The Golden Bough took ""a comparativist or universalist view,"" and Frazer ""piled example upon example.""  It is then reasonable to assume that the reader of this huge collection of myths from diverse civilizations would gain information about a wide variety of cultures, leading to a broad understanding of many cultures rather than a deep understanding of a particular culture.
it demonstrated that the comparativist method can be used to elucidate myths across cultures (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 2, The Golden Bough ""emphasized the striking similarities found in myths across cultures and time periods"" in what amounted to ""a comparativist or universalist view that Frazer…employed lavishly, piling example upon example.""  Thus, Frazer's work seemed to demonstrate that the comparative method could be used to elucidate (shed light on) various myths across cultures.  However, the passage never links such a demonstration to the popularity of his work."
"224","Based on the passage, one can most reasonably conclude that Frazerian anthropology seeks to:","B","40","First published in two volumes, Frazer's vast compendium of myth and ritual had by 1915 filled twelve.  The work emphasized the striking similarities found in myths across cultures and time periods—in other words, a comparativist or universalist view that Frazer did not invent but employed lavishly, piling example upon example.  Frazer's text proved an intellectual and stylistic phenomenon with an ever-expanding influence on the cultural milieu. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, Frazer's work ""emphasized the striking similarities found in myths across cultures and time periods.""  Frazer's method could thus be called ""comparativist or universalist.""  Such an approach, which Frazer reportedly ""employed lavishly, piling example upon example,"" would have focused on common elements appearing in myths from different societies.  Therefore, one can most reasonably conclude that Frazer's approach to anthropology seeks to identify the mythic elements that a society shares with others.
 (Choices A and C)  emphasize the connection between a society's myths and language; and organize the basic components of myths into pairs of opposites.  Paragraphs 3 and 4 describe how later anthropologists tended either to diverge from or to build on Frazer's work.  For example, ""Claude Lévi-Strauss went on to integrate Frazer's comparative method with the structural linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure and Roman Jakobson to create structural anthropology, which organized the basic elements of myths into binary oppositions"" (Paragraph 3).  Therefore, the passage indicates that structuralist anthropology, not Frazerian anthropology per se, sought to connect a society's myths with the general structure of language.  In addition, the passage conveys that structuralist anthropology ""organized the basic elements of myths into binary oppositions,"" that is, arranged these basic components into pairs of opposites.  However, by contrast, Frazer's comparativist approach ""emphasized the striking similarities found in myths across cultures and time periods.""
(Choice D)  turn ineffective mythic practices into effective ones.  Paragraph 4 conveys Leach's criticism that ""Frazer relied shamelessly on secondhand material culled from missionaries and imperial officials rather than on his own interactions with native peoples"" as he had no direct interactions with native peoples nor the opportunity to observe their rituals.  Given that this was the case, it is implausible that Frazerian anthropology would have sought to intervene in or to try to transform mythic practices in any way.  Furthermore, the passage does not indicate that even Frazer's successors—such as Malinowski, ""who…began incorporating fieldwork into the discipline, focusing on the ways mythic practices contributed to the overall stability of a society"" (Paragraph 3)—were interested in trying to revise the mythic practices of the peoples with whom they interacted to make them more effective."
"225","Based on the passage information about Frazer's approach to anthropology, which of the following texts would most reasonably be regarded as Frazerian?","B","40","The work emphasized the striking similarities found in myths across cultures and time periods—in other words, a comparativist or universalist view that Frazer did not invent but employed lavishly, piling example upon example. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 states that Frazer's work ""emphasized the striking similarities found in myths across cultures and time periods—in other words, a comparativist or universalist view that Frazer…employed lavishly, piling example upon example.""  Based on this information, Frazer believed that, regardless of historical context or geography, myths (ie, culturally significant stories) were informed by the same basic patterns.  Consequently, an account in which the lives of diverse people all follow common mythic patterns would most reasonably be regarded as Frazerian.
 (Choice A)  A text detailing direct observations of the rituals of people from a specific tribe.  The passage suggests that Frazer's work was criticized because it was not based on firsthand research.  As Paragraph 3 states, Malinowski ""departed radically"" from Frazer's approach by ""incorporating fieldwork"" into his anthropological studies.  Similarly, Paragraph 4 conveys that Leach denounced Frazer for having ""relied shamelessly on secondhand material…rather than on his own interactions with native peoples.""  Thus, Frazer would not have actually observed tribal rituals.  Therefore, a text detailing direct observations of the rituals of people from a specific tribe would not be regarded as Frazerian.
(Choices C and D)  An article stressing the incompatibilities between the myths of Europe and Africa; and A poem that describes someone's personal myth.  Paragraph 2 states that The Golden Bough ""emphasized the striking similarities in myths across cultures and time periods,"" taking ""a comparativist or universalist view"" in which Frazer cited ""example upon example.""  Thus, to be identified as Frazerian an article would have to stress the similarities between the myths of Europe and Africa, not the incompatibilities.  Similarly, a poem identified as Frazerian would describe a universal myth based on common or shared experiences, not a personal myth based on unique or individual experiences."
"226","What is the central idea of the passage?","D","40","Ironically, one of the most influential works of anthropology ever written was destined to have its most enduring impact outside that field….  While the book's overwhelming popularity assured its place in posterity, the changing face of science and the further emergence of anthropology as a discipline meant it would end up as reviled as it was revered. (Paragraph 1)
Frazer's text proved an intellectual and stylistic phenomenon with an ever-expanding influence on the cultural milieu.  Those pulled into the Frazerian vortex included pioneering psychologists Freud and Jung as well as many of the most creative writers of the early 20th century, such as James Joyce, Joseph Conrad, and T. S. Eliot. (Paragraph 2)
Leach nevertheless attacked [Frazer] as a plagiarist, distortionist, and popularizer….alleging that he routinely embellished sources and twisted information to support preformulated theories.  According to Leach, Frazer relied shamelessly on secondhand material…rather than on his own interactions with native peoples.  Moreover, many of his comparisons of myths seemed based solely on superficial resemblances between just a few elements.  Lastly, Leach joined in decrying what critics termed Frazer's ""misapplication of Darwin's theory of biological evolution to human history and psychology""…. (Paragraph 4)
Such criticism notwithstanding, the popularity of The Golden Bough has remained largely undiminished and its impact on the culture of the early 20th century indisputable. (Paragraph 5)
The passage's opening statement about Frazer's The Golden Bough conveys the central idea: ""Ironically, one of the most influential works of anthropology ever written was destined to have its most enduring impact outside that field.""  Paragraph 1 also states that the book's ""overwhelming popularity assured its place in posterity"" even though ""the changing face of science and the further emergence of anthropology as a discipline meant it would end up as reviled as it was revered.""
Paragraph 2 reinforces that ""Frazer's text proved an intellectual and stylistic phenomenon with an ever-expanding influence on the cultural milieu (environment).""  As the author also notes, it influenced ""pioneering psychologists Freud and Jung as well as many of the most creative writers of the 20th century.""
In Paragraph 4, Leach denounces Frazer as being—in the context of emerging anthropology—""a plagiarist, distortionist, and popularizer"" who misapplied methods and theories.  However, as Paragraph 5 reasserts, ""[T]he popularity of The Golden Bough has remained largely undiminished and its impact on the culture of the early 20th century indisputable.""  Consequently, the central idea of the passage is that The Golden Bough's influence on culture outweighs its influence on anthropology.
 (Choice A)  The Golden Bough was written more as a work of literature than of anthropology.  Paragraph 1 describes Frazer's text as ""packaged in poetic prose.""  Furthermore, it proved ""a rare example of adventure tale, travelogue, and detective story all rolled into one"" that was ""enormously entertaining to read.""  According to Paragraph 2, the work had an ""ever-expanding influence on the cultural milieu (environment)"" and on ""many of the most creative writers of the early 20th century.""  Such evidence underscores that The Golden Bough was more appreciated as a work of literature than of anthropology.  However, the passage also focuses on the work's scientific shortcomings and its influence in psychology.
(Choice B)  Progress in anthropology has made Frazer's work less relevant.  The passage stresses how Frazer's work became less relevant in the field of anthropology.  As Paragraph 1 states, ""[T]he changing face of science and the further emergence of anthropology as a discipline meant [The Golden Bough] would end up as reviled as it was revered.""  According to Paragraph 3, later ""groundbreaking anthropological works…departed radically in method and style from Frazer's grand exercise in mythography (collecting and studying myths) and ethnography (describing the customs of particular peoples and cultures).""  Furthermore, as fieldwork became essential, Frazer was criticized for relying on ""secondhand material"" (Paragraph 4).  However, the passage's central idea also stresses that Frazer's work had more influence outside anthropology.
(Choice C)  Frazer's work influenced the formation of structural anthropology.  Passage information reveals that Frazer's work did influence the formation of structural anthropology.  According to Paragraph 3, ""Claude Lévi-Strauss went on to integrate Frazer's comparative method with the structural linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure and Roman Jakobson to create structural anthropology.""  However, as the passage also emphasizes, Frazer's approach had limited direct impact on anthropology, influencing fields such as psychology and literature instead."
"227","Which of the following ravens exhibited the least success at retrieving the suspended food in Heinrich's experiment?
Bird 3
Bird 27
Bird 30","B","41","One occasion of such behavior was documented by University of Vermont zoologist Bernd Heinrich in an experiment with Common Ravens.  Heinrich's central focus was whether the birds could discern the solution to a newly encountered problem of food acquisition without any training or prior familiarity with the problem's elements.  To address this question, he presented groups of ravens with pieces of meat suspended from a perch by a length of string.  The food was too far from either the perch or the ground to be reached from those vantage points.  Hence, accessing the food efficiently would require using the string itself, a situation not encountered in the wild and to which none of the birds had been previously exposed. (Paragraph 2)
The first two ravens to approach the food found little success in retrieving it.  As Heinrich relates, both Bird 3 and Bird 27 attempted to jump and grab the meat from the air.  Although this process resulted in only tiny scraps of food being obtained, both birds initially ""tried no other method after the pattern was established on the first day.""  However, another raven fared far better.…  Days later, Bird 5 also discovered how to access the meat in this way, completing ""the entire repetitive sequence correctly all at once.""  Eventually Bird 3 and Bird 30 learned as well, but only after weeks of further opportunities. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 2 describes ""an experiment with Common Ravens"" conducted by Bernd Heinrich, based on the presentation of ""pieces of meat suspended from a perch by a length of string.""  Because the meat could not be reached from either the perch or the ground, ""accessing the food efficiently would require using the string itself.""
According to Paragraph 3, ""The first two ravens to approach the food found little success in retrieving it.  As Heinrich relates, both Bird 3 and Bird 27 attempted to jump and grab the meat from the air.""  The author notes that despite the inadequacy of these efforts, at first neither bird modified its behavior: ""Although this process resulted in only tiny scraps of food being obtained, both birds initially 'tried no other method after the pattern was established on the first day.'""  Therefore, at the beginning of the experiment both Bird 3 and Bird 27 were very unsuccessful at retrieving the food.
However, the passage goes on to convey that ""[e]ventually Bird 3 and Bird 30 learned"" how to use the string to pull up the meat, ""after weeks of further opportunities.""  By contrast, the passage never suggests that Bird 27 likewise learned at any point in the experiment.  Therefore, Bird 27 exhibited the least success at retrieving the suspended food in Heinrich's experiment (Number II).
 (Number I)  Bird 3.  Bird 3 ""initially 'tried no other method'"" besides ineffectively attempting to grab the meat from the air.  However, unlike Bird 27, the passage indicates that ""[e]ventually Bird 3…learned"" how to successfully access the suspended food (Paragraph 3).
(Number III)  Bird 30.  Paragraph 3 states that ""Bird 5…discovered how to access the meat.""  The author then adds that ""[e]ventually Bird 3 and Bird 30 learned as well, but only after weeks of further opportunities.""  Therefore, the passage includes Bird 30 in the group of ravens that learned to successfully retrieve the meat in Heinrich's experiment."
"228","In the context of the passage, what is the primary significance of the claim that the suspended food represents a situation ravens would not encounter in the wild?","B","41","One occasion of such behavior was documented by University of Vermont zoologist Bernd Heinrich in an experiment with Common Ravens.  Heinrich's central focus was whether the birds could discern the solution to a newly encountered problem of food acquisition without any training or prior familiarity with the problem's elements.  To address this question, he presented groups of ravens with pieces of meat suspended from a perch by a length of string.  The food was too far from either the perch or the ground to be reached from those vantage points.  Hence, accessing the food efficiently would require using the string itself, a situation not encountered in the wild and to which none of the birds had been previously exposed. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, ""Heinrich's central focus was whether the birds could discern the solution to a newly encountered problem of food acquisition without any training or prior familiarity with the problem's elements.""  In the experiment he designed, groups of ravens encountered ""pieces of meat suspended from a perch by a length of string.""  In this scenario, ""accessing the food efficiently would require using the string itself, a situation not encountered in the wild and to which none of the birds had been previously exposed.""
Because Heinrich was testing whether ravens could solve a completely unfamiliar problem, it was essential to ensure that neither instinct nor prior experience could influence their ability to approach it.  In other words, Heinrich wanted to preclude those factors as possible origins of the birds' responses.  Therefore, the primary significance of the claim that the suspended food represents a situation ravens would not encounter in the wild is that it rules out potential sources for the birds' behavior.
 By contrast, none of the following represents the primary significance of the claim that the suspended food represents a situation ravens would not encounter in the wild:
It means that the food retrieval could not be achieved through trial and error (Choice A).  Paragraph 3 describes how Bird 4 ""'performed a behavioral sequence of at least six steps…with no apparent trial-and-error learning for most if not all of these steps.'""  However, the passage never indicates that the experiment was designed to prevent a trial-and-error approach.  Moreover, whether such an approach could have been successful is a separate point from whether the scenario would be encountered in the wild.
It highlights that the experiment focused on animals in captivity (Choice C).  It can reasonably be assumed that Heinrich's experiment was performed on animals in captivity, since it took place over several weeks and the birds were identified by numbers.  Thus, working with captive animals was an inherent part of the experiment.  Accordingly, the fact that ravens would not encounter the experimental scenario in the wild is not intended to highlight the ravens' captivity.  Rather, the author highlights ""the ravens' apparent ability to solve a problem for which neither instinct nor experience could be expected to have prepared them"" (Paragraph 4).
It explains the difficulty of the task presented (Choice D).  Paragraph 2 explains that ""Heinrich's central focus was whether the birds could discern the solution to a newly encountered problem.""  Accordingly, the fact that the ravens had to approach that problem ""without any training or prior familiarity with the problem's elements"" is the most significant part of the experiment's design.  Therefore, although the passage does imply that the task of retrieving suspended meat was difficult for the ravens, that difficulty is secondary to the point that experience and instinct would not have prepared the ravens to confront the situation presented."
"229","What is the main point of Paragraph 4?","C","41","The most notable point of these observations is the ravens' apparent ability to solve a problem for which neither instinct nor experience could be expected to have prepared them.  Heinrich casts his experiment in terms of testing for insight, or ""the possibility of mental awareness—of seeing into a situation.""  Naturally, such awareness can only be inferred rather than observed directly, and researchers should be wary of the tendency to anthropomorphize animals when discussing their mental capabilities.  Nevertheless, such wariness should not prevent us from drawing at least probable or tentative conclusions.  Bird 4 especially seems almost to have mentally worked through the scenario in the intervening time between its originally unsuccessful and subsequent successful attempts to retrieve the food.  In the human world, we might speak of someone thinking about a problem for a while before trying another solution.  Even if we are reluctant to view Bird 4's behavior as a precise analogue, it seems clear that the raven displayed evidence of a noteworthy mental operation.  In further experiments, some other ravens also demonstrated the ability to pull up food on strings.  Although Heinrich notes that the birds exhibiting this behavior are ""possibly exceptional,"" they represent a fascinating example in our understanding of animal intelligence. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, ""The most notable point of these observations is the ravens' apparent ability to solve a problem for which neither instinct nor experience could be expected to have prepared them.  Heinrich casts his experiment in terms of testing for insight, or 'the possibility of mental awareness—of seeing into a situation.'""  The author implies that the test was successful, suggesting that some of the ravens did see into the situation in this way.  For instance, ""Bird 4 especially seems almost to have mentally worked through the scenario in the intervening time between its originally unsuccessful and subsequent successful attempts to retrieve the food.""
The author further compares Bird 4's behavior to ""the human world, [where] we might speak of someone thinking about a problem for a while before trying another solution.""  In addition, the passage goes on to say that ""some other ravens also demonstrated the ability to pull up food on strings,"" declaring that those ravens ""represent a fascinating example in our understanding of animal intelligence.""  Therefore, Paragraph 4 focuses on the idea that, based on Heinrich's findings, at least some ravens seem to exhibit insight in solving problems.
 By contrast, none of the following represents the main point of Paragraph 4:
Heinrich conceived his experiment as testing for insight (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 4, ""Heinrich casts his experiment in terms of testing for insight.""  However, the larger point of the paragraph is that the test seems to have been successful.  For instance, ""Bird 4…displayed evidence of a noteworthy mental operation,"" and the birds exhibiting similar behavior ""represent a fascinating example in our understanding of animal intelligence.""
Ravens' mental capabilities are exceptional among most animals (Choice B).  Paragraph 4 discusses ravens that ""demonstrated the ability to pull up food on strings.""  The author notes that although ""the birds exhibiting this behavior are 'possibly exceptional,' they represent a fascinating example in our understanding of animal intelligence.""  Accordingly, Paragraph 4 suggests that these birds are exceptional among other ravens; it does not compare the mental capabilities of ravens to those of other animals.
Ravens' mental capabilities should not be anthropomorphized (Choice D).  Paragraph 4 states that ""researchers should be wary of the tendency to anthropomorphize animals when discussing their mental capabilities.""  However, the author then implies that some level of anthropomorphizing may be justified, stating that ""such wariness should not prevent us from drawing at least probable or tentative conclusions.""  In addition, he or she arguably anthropomorphizes explicitly by comparing one raven's mental capabilities to ""the human world, [where] we might speak of someone thinking about a problem for a while before trying another solution."""
"230","Which of the following pieces of information would most weaken the author's conclusions about the birds in Heinrich's experiment?","D","41","Heinrich's central focus was whether the birds could discern the solution to a newly encountered problem of food acquisition without any training or prior familiarity with the problem's elements….  Hence, accessing the food efficiently would require using the string itself, a situation not encountered in the wild and to which none of the birds had been previously exposed. (Paragraph 2)
Thus, the raven ""performed a behavioral sequence of at least six steps…with no apparent trial-and-error learning for most if not all of these steps, chaining these steps together into a single unbroken sequence.""  Days later, Bird 5 also discovered how to access the meat in this way, completing ""the entire repetitive sequence correctly all at once.""  Eventually Bird 3 and Bird 30 learned as well, but only after weeks of further opportunities. (Paragraph 3)
Heinrich casts his experiment in terms of testing for insight, or ""the possibility of mental awareness—of seeing into a situation.""

According to Paragraph 2, ""Heinrich's central focus was whether the birds could discern the solution to a newly encountered problem of food acquisition without any training or prior familiarity with the problem's elements.""  Thus, his experiment was intended to represent a challenge ""to which none of the birds had been previously exposed.""  Similarly, Paragraph 3 describes Bird 4 as performing ""'a behavioral sequence of at least six steps…with no apparent trial-and-error learning for most if not all of these steps.'""  The author further indicates that Bird 5, Bird 3, and Bird 30 also eventually learned how to successfully access the meat in the experiment.
Paragraph 4 notes that Heinrich was ""testing for insight, or 'the possibility of mental awareness—of seeing into a situation.'""  The author implies that he or she sees that test as successful: although ""such awareness can only be inferred rather than observed directly,"" we can draw ""at least probable or tentative conclusions"" about ravens' capabilities.  For instance, Bird 4 ""displayed evidence of a noteworthy mental operation,"" and the successful ravens ""represent a fascinating example in our understanding of animal intelligence.""
However, if some ravens had access to the suspended food when not being observed by Heinrich, it is possible that they engaged in a trial-and-error process or otherwise gained experience with the problem without Heinrich's awareness.  If so, this fact would call into question the nature of the birds' success and its implications for their mental capabilities; hence, it would weaken the author's conclusions about the birds in Heinrich's experiment.
 (Choice A)  The Loggerhead Shrike, a non-Corvid species, instinctually suspends its prey by impaling it on thorns.  Paragraph 1 states that ""some members of the Corvid family (such as ravens, crows, and jays) display a high capability to successfully confront novel challenges through innovative behavior.""  However, information about a non-Corvid species would not affect whether ravens display such capabilities.  Moreover, even if a comparison between Corvids and non-Corvids is implied, the instinct of Shrikes to impale and suspend their prey is not an equivalent situation to a bird encountering food suspended by a string.  Therefore, the Shrike's behavior would not weaken the author's conclusions about the birds in Heinrich's experiment.
(Choices B and C)  Instead of attempting to retrieve the suspended food, some ravens tried to steal food retrieved by others; and Some ravens never successfully retrieved the suspended food.  Paragraph 3 states that Bird 27 ""found little success in retrieving"" the food and implies that it never learned how to acquire the meat effectively.  Similarly, Paragraph 4 conveys that ""some other ravens…demonstrated the ability to pull up food on strings,"" but it also notes Heinrich's assertion that ""the birds exhibiting this behavior are 'possibly exceptional.'""  Accordingly, the passage suggests that only some of the ravens in Heinrich's study demonstrated exceptional abilities.  Therefore, if other ravens were unsuccessful at retrieving the food (or simply tried to steal it from others), that would not weaken the author's conclusions."
"231","During another researcher's observation of Corvids, a Steller's Jay deliberately broke a twig off a bush and subsequently thrust it at an American Crow with which it was competing for food.

In particular, some members of the Corvid family (such as ravens, crows, and jays) display a high capability to successfully confront novel challenges through innovative behavior. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 states that ""[r]esearch on animal intelligence has proliferated in recent decades, producing additional evidence of complex types of thought in non-human creatures.""  In the scenario described in the question, the researcher interprets the jay's behavior as constituting the use of a weapon.  In other words, the jay seemed to intentionally make a tool that it then used to threaten another animal, behavior that suggests a purposive mental process involving multiple steps.  Therefore, the researcher's interpretation would most accord with the conclusion that animal behavior research provides evidence of complex types of thought in non-humans.
 (Choice A)  The claim that avians have displayed even more striking behavior than primates.  According to Paragraph 1, ""Although primates have been the most frequent subjects of such study, observations of avians (birds) have at times proved even more striking.""  However, the passage never discusses any examples of primate behavior, nor specifically whether a primate may have used a weapon.  Without this information, it is unclear whether the jay's behavior should be seen as more striking than the behavior of primates.  Hence, the researcher's interpretation would not necessarily accord with that idea.
(Choices B and C)  The claim that some types of challenges would not be encountered in the wild; and The conclusion that Corvids are highly capable of successfully confronting novel challenges.  According to Paragraph 1, ""[S]ome members of the Corvid family (such as ravens, crows, and jays) display a high capability to successfully confront novel challenges through innovative behavior.""  The jay's behavior of breaking a twig from a bush to use it as a weapon can indeed be seen as innovative.  However, the challenge it faced involved competing with a rival for food, a common situation that is frequently encountered by wild animals.  Consequently, the researcher's interpretation does not most accord with ideas about confronting novel challenges or challenges that would not be encountered in the wild."
"232","Which of the following is NOT mentioned as a consideration that should be made by the doctor prior to deciding what must be done with the antidote?","C","42","Accordingly, the doctor has only enough of the antidote to save either Citizen A or the five other citizens.  (Paragraph 2)
It may seem clear that a doctor could not justifiably allocate the entirety of an antidote to preserving one citizen's life at the expense of losing five others.  However, suppose that Citizen A is the only patient currently present in the doctor's clinic, as the remaining patients are being transferred to Dr. Jones' facility by their respective physicians.  Citizen A is, in fact, Dr. Jones' longtime patient.  The doctor must therefore decide between two exigencies:  to save his own patient's life or to await the arrival of the five remaining citizens.  (Paragraph 3)
One should consider, for instance, how long each patient can survive without the antidote.  (Paragraph 4)
The passage does not mention that the doctor should consider the possibility that the antidote may not function properly in each citizen.  Rather, the passage assumes that the antidote will function, but that each citizen will require a different amount of it, depending on the amount of poison consumed.
Based on the passage, Dr. Jones should consider the following prior to administering the antidote:
The amount of antidote necessary to cure each patient:  ""the doctor has only enough of the antidote to be able to save citizen A or the five other citizens"" (Paragraph 2).  Citizen A would require the entire antidote whereas the other citizens would require only a fraction of the antidote to be cured. (Choice A)
His responsibility to the patient in the clinic:  Dr. Jones' decision is complicated by the fact that Citizen A, a ""longtime patient,"" is ""the only patient currently present"" in the clinic.  Therefore, the doctor must consider if he should ""save his own patient's life"" (Paragraph 3). (Choice B)
The urgency of time in administering the antidote:  Dr. Jones must consider how long he can wait for the remaining patients to arrive to administer the antidote.  He has to choose between administering the antidote to Citizen A or waiting for the other ""five remaining citizens"" to arrive. (Choice D)"

One should consider, for instance, how long each patient can survive without the antidote.  Unfortunately, no one has a crystal ball to predict future events.  A decision must be made in conjunction with the information available at the time.  (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 mentions the crystal ball to highlight the doctor's inability to predict the future in conjunction with the severity of the choice he must make:  save citizen A or save the five citizens.  This is important because Dr. Jones must accept whatever decision he makes.  According to the passage, he unfortunately does not have a crystal ball to predict the ending and must struggle with the uncertainty of the outcome of his choice.
(Choice A)  The crystal ball is mentioned after discussing the risk of losing any of the six citizens and considering ""how long each patient can survive without the antidote.""  The crystal ball indicates that the outcome of the decision cannot be predicted, but is completely unrelated to the definition of good versus evil in this circumstance.
(Choice B)  Although the risk of losing all the citizens is related to the time it will take for them to arrive at the clinic, the crystal ball does not pertain directly to the urgency of time.
(Choice C)  The crystal ball does not serve to (symbolically) undermine the doctor's ability to make an appropriate decision."
"234","The author implies that the virtues of compassion, empathy, and loyalty are:","D","42","With this in mind, one may argue that the determination of good versus evil in making a decision lies in the doctor's motivations as he considers the consequences of his impending actions.  Imagine Dr. Jones' nurse exclaiming, ""But the doctor cannot make an objective comparison between the lives of other citizens and his own patient!""  Yet, perhaps the doctor would be selfishly inclined to save Citizen A, as Citizen A is the only one whose death would be considered a grievous personal loss.  (Paragraph 5)
But are such selfish human instincts then to be labeled as evil?  The same propensities labeled as selfish underlie characteristics classified as decent human virtues, such as compassion, empathy, and loyalty.  (Paragraph 6)
As Paragraph 5 explains, there are instincts associated with personal attachment to others (ie, Citizen A's ""death would be considered a grievous personal loss"").  The author states that the same human instincts that underlie Dr. Jones' personal motives (ie, selfishness) to save Citizen A also underlie ""decent human virtues"" such as ""compassion, empathy, and loyalty.""
In other words, Dr. Jones may be considered selfish in his desire to save Citizen A because he is attached to this patient.  Such personal attachments (which can lead to bias) are necessary to cultivate the ""decent human virtues"" mentioned by the author.
(Choices A and B)  The author does not indicate whether these values are characteristic of all doctor-patient relationships/interactions or whether they are enhanced by the experience of grief and loss.
(Choice C)  There are no passage indications to suggest that compassion, empathy, and loyalty are guided by universal (common to everyone) human instincts.  On the contrary, ""the determination of good versus evil…lies in the doctor's motivations.""  Therefore, human instincts may be good (ie, compassion, empathy, and loyalty) or evil (ie, selfishness)."
"235","Suppose that, following ingestion of Poison H by the citizens, Dr. Jones modifies the antidote slightly in an attempt to provide more to all affected patients.  Dr. Jones finds that as a result of the modifications, the efficacy of the antidote diminishes rapidly as time passes.

One should consider, for instance, how long each patient can survive without the antidote.  (Paragraph 4)
The new information provided states that following ingestion of Poison H, the doctor modified the antidote, but that due to these modifications the efficacy (effectiveness/success) of the antidote diminished (decreased) rapidly with time.  Paragraph 4 suggests that if Dr. Jones did not administer the entire antidote to Citizen A and waited for the remaining citizens to arrive, there would be a chance that the citizens would die from the poison while being transported to his clinic.
In light of the new scenario, the Dr. Jones would have had to quickly choose between giving the antidote to Citizen A and hoping it is still effective or waiting a longer time for the other citizens to arrive and risking the antidote becoming completely ineffective.  In addition, the antidote would be less effective in the remaining five citizens even if they were still alive.  As a result, Dr. Jones would be more likely to administer the antidote to Citizen A, the only patient in the clinic at the time.
(Choice B)  Dr. Jones would be less likely in this circumstance to withhold the antidote from Citizen A, given that, in the time following ingestion of Poison H, the efficacy of the antidote decreases.  The doctor is at greater risk of losing all six citizens, but he could still make a timely decision and hope to save at least Citizen A, who is present.
(Choice C)  The passage does not indicate whether Dr. Jones would defer to his nurse in making the decision.
(Choice D)  It is unlikely that Dr. Jones would fail to consider this new information (ie, the diminishing efficacy of the antidote), as it would affect his ability to save all poisoned citizens."
"236","Which of the following conclusions would be most in accordance with the ideas expressed in the passage?","A","42","Evil can most accurately be defined as the direct antithesis of good.  However, when a human situation does not lend itself to clear designations of ultimate good and ultimate evil, or of right and wrong, then the best that one can hope for is to be able to make an informed decision about which course of action is ""more right"" and which is ""more wrong.""  (Paragraph 1)
In such circumstances, the decision between right and wrong, or the moral dilemma, escalates into what is more accurately a personal determination of good and evil.  In this way, the relative construct of right and wrong, as determined by one's best attempts at logic and sense, must be subordinated to a moral imperative that may be said to be absolute:  namely, that one must abide by an internal commitment to what one has reasoned to be the right decision and follow a corresponding course of action in the allotted time.  (Paragraph 7)
Paragraph 1 implies that morality relies on certain, absolute universal laws and, beyond that, an individual's own reasoning in particular scenarios.  The author alludes to universal morality in the first sentence of the passage by stating, ""Evil can most accurately be defined as the direct antithesis of good.""  This suggests that the author does believe in absolute constructs that define good and evil.
However, the author also claims that certain situations do not lend themselves ""to making clear designations of ultimate good and ultimate evil"" and that, in these circumstances, individuals must use their own insight or reasoning to decide the best course of action.  In this case, the definitions of good and evil are not fixed (Choice C).
In Paragraph 7, the author reveals ""a moral imperative that may be said to be absolute:  namely, that one must abide by an internal commitment to what one has reasoned to be the right decision and follow a corresponding course of action in the allotted time.""  The individual remains responsible to determine a ""relative construct of right and wrong, or the moral dilemma"" according to the individual's ""best attempts at logic and sense.""
(Choice B)  In Paragraph 6, the author claims that a decision can ""be argued as evil"" as in cases when an individual ""opts to dismiss or distrust his individual conscience.""
(Choice D)  When the author defines evil as ""the direct antithesis of good,"" this is proposed as a universally accepted truth.  The author focuses on explaining that individuals must use their own ""internal commitment"" to judge what is right and what is wrong (Paragraph 7).  Therefore, this internal moral compass is likely guided by the universal truth that both good and evil exist and accordingly provides guidance for decision-making."
"237","A study finds that 90% of practicing doctors believe that the most beneficial treatment decisions cannot be determined by computer-generated algorithms but must be determined in light of a doctor's observations of the preference and needs of an individual patient.

(Paragraph 1)
If 90% of doctors believe that no set of rules (computer-generated algorithms) exist that can determine the best course of action for each individual patient, this claim would support the author's assertion that humans (not computers) should abide by an internal commitment to what is right and what is wrong.  In these cases, doctors must use their insight and observations of an individual patient to determine for themselves which decisions are ""more right"" and most beneficial to a patient.
(Choices A and C)  This finding neither directly supports nor challenges the idea that morality, as defined in terms of good and evil, is absolute or clearly designated.
(Choice D)  This statistic suggests that the best a doctor can hope for is, in fact, to determine which actions are ""more right"" and which are ""more wrong"" in a given scenario."
"238","Physician burnout has been associated with exhaustion and a loss of interest, compassion, and previously acknowledged purpose.  How would these symptoms affect Dr. Jones if he were experiencing physician burnout?","B","42","There are particular circumstances in which the doctor would indeed be remiss to the point of what could be argued as evil—as in cases where he opts to dismiss or distrust his individual conscience.  Consider the case in which he doubts his ability to arrive at a judicious conclusion and abdicates his responsibility for making this grave decision to the nurse.  Or consider the case in which he concludes that it is indeed more valiant to save the five citizens, yet fails to act on his decision out of personal anguish at losing Citizen A or to put an end to the ordeal.  (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 6 clearly states that the doctor ""doubts his ability to arrive at a judicious (well-judged/sensible) conclusion.""  This means that the doctor was consciously weighing the seriousness of his decision.  However, if Dr. Jones were experiencing physician burnout:  defined as exhaustion and a loss of interest, compassion, and previously acknowledged purpose, he would most likely dismiss his own conscience in making a decision.  In the second example in Paragraph 6, the doctor fails to wait for the remaining five citizens ""to put an end to the ordeal,"" which would more likely occur if he were burned out.
(Choice A)  In the passage, Dr. Jones' potential grief over the idea of the losing Citizen A is linked to his feeling of personal attachment, which the author relates to the human virtue of compassion.  A doctor experiencing loss of compassion during burnout would be less likely to harbor feelings of attachment to Citizen A.
(Choice C)  The characteristics of physician burnout do not indicate whether the doctor would require more or less information to complete the decision.  However, if Dr. Jones were tired or otherwise experiencing a loss of interest, he might make decisions more hastily, therefore taking less information into account.
(Choice D)  If Dr. Jones were experiencing physician burnout, he would be experiencing exhaustion and loss of interest, implying that he would be less able to make sound decisions.  Therefore, he would be less likely to arrive at a judicious (sensible) conclusion regarding the antidote."
"239","Which of the following distinctions between related concepts is NOT made by the passage author?","C","43","Of late it has become popular among linguists and literary theorists to assert that a work's meaning depends upon the individual reader.  It is readers, we are told, not authors, who create meaning, by interacting with a text rather than simply receiving it.  Thus, a reader transcends the aims of the author, producing their own reading of the text.  Indeed, on this line of thinking, even to speak of ""the"" text is to commit a conceptual error; every text is in fact many texts, a plurality of interpretations that resist comparative evaluation.  This view is nonsense.  That many otherwise sensible scholars should be attracted to it can perhaps be readily explained, but we should first delineate why the theory goes so far astray.... (Paragraph 1)
The passage begins by discussing a theory of interpretation which is held by many scholars, but which the passage author opposes.  According to Paragraph 1, ""[I]t has become popular among linguists and literary theorists to assert that a work's meaning depends upon the individual reader.  It is readers, we are told, not authors, who create meaning.""  Although the passage author asserts that ""[t]his view is nonsense,"" they admit that ""many otherwise sensible scholars [are] attracted to it.""
By describing them as ""otherwise sensible,"" the passage author implies that such scholars are generally credible (even if they are wrong about this particular idea).  However, the passage never describes any scholars as unsensible or non-credible.  Therefore, the passage author does not make a distinction between credible and non-credible scholars.
 By contrast, the passage author makes distinctions between each of the following:
Greater and lesser types of literature (Choice A).  Paragraph 4 contrasts ""the loftiest tomes of Shakespeare or Milton"" with ""the lowliest of yellowed paperbacks.""  Thus, by describing some literature as lofty and other literature as lowly, the passage author conveys that some types of literature are of greater significance than others.
An idea's content and its correctness (Choice B).  In describing a hypothetical conversation, Paragraph 3 states that ""Jones might judge Smith's ideas to be wrong, unfounded, etc.  But whether Smith's ideas are right or wrong is a different matter from what those ideas are.""  Therefore, the passage author distinguishes between the content of Smith's ideas and whether those ideas are correct.
Accurate and inaccurate interpretations (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 5, literary scholarship ""must presume the existence of standards for success: accuracy and inaccuracy, depth or shallowness of analysis, grounds for preferring one interpretation to another.""  Therefore, the passage author distinguishes between accurate and inaccurate interpretations of literature."
"240","Based on the view of interpretation described by the passage author in Paragraph 1, which of the following areas of study would be most similar to literary scholarship?","C","43","Of late it has become popular among linguists and literary theorists to assert that a work's meaning depends upon the individual reader.  It is readers, we are told, not authors, who create meaning, by interacting with a text rather than simply receiving it.  Thus, a reader transcends the aims of the author, producing their own reading of the text.  Indeed, on this line of thinking, even to speak of ""the"" text is to commit a conceptual error; every text is in fact many texts, a plurality of interpretations that resist comparative evaluation.  This view is nonsense. (Paragraph 1)
In Paragraph 1, the passage author describes a view of interpretation in which ""[i]t is readers…not authors, who create meaning.""  On this line of thinking, ""a reader transcends the aims of the author,"" with the result that multiple scholars of a work generate ""a plurality of interpretations that resist comparative evaluation.""  Thus, according to this view the meaning of a literary work is determined by those who analyze it, regardless of what the work's creator may have intended.
Like works of literature, works of art are also interpreted.  Similarly, although it is reasonable to think that artists create their works with a certain message in mind, it would be likely for different critics to have different interpretations of what those works mean.  Accordingly, based on the view of interpretation described by the passage author in Paragraph 1, art criticism would be most similar to literary scholarship.
 (Choice A)  Code decryption.  Paragraph 1 discusses the view that ""[i]t is readers…not authors, who create meaning"" and that ""every text is in fact many texts, a plurality of interpretations that resist comparative evaluation.""  However, the purpose of code decryption is to expose disguised communication in order to determine an author's specific message.  Consequently, unlike the view of interpretation described in Paragraph 1, code decryption is based on the assumption that the true meaning of a work depends on its author, not its readers.
(Choice B)  Linguistic translation.  Paragraph 1 describes a view of literary scholarship in which ""[i]t is readers…not authors, who create meaning….  Thus, a reader transcends the aims of the author.""  However, the intention of linguistic translation is to accurately render a speaker's original ideas into another language.  Unlike studies in literature or art, there is no presumption that it could be appropriate for translators to ""superimpose their own volitional perspectives (ie, interpret a work in terms of their own subjective views)"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, there is a key difference between linguistic translation and literary scholarship as described in Paragraph 1.
(Choice D)  Forensic accounting.  Forensic accounting is used to uncover hidden evidence of financial crimes.  Accordingly, the only correct ""interpretation"" of the records involved would be one that accurately describes the financial activities of a person or corporation.  Therefore, unlike the view of literary interpretation described in Paragraph 1, such a process would not involve producing ""a plurality of interpretations that resist comparative evaluation."""
"241","The author's ""more complex supposition"" in Paragraph 2 implies that speakers:","D","43","Suppose Smith is conveying his ideas to Jones in conversation (the particular topic is of no consequence).  Afterward, we discover that the men differ in their accounts of what Smith had expressed.  At this point, Jones may decide that he misunderstood Smith, or perhaps that Smith was unclear.  A more complex supposition might be that Smith misused some key term, so his words did not fully match his intentions.  Any of these possibilities would reasonably describe why Jones and Smith possessed different opinions about what Smith had said. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 describes a scenario in which ""Smith is conveying his ideas to Jones in conversation….  Afterward, we discover that the men differ in their accounts of what Smith had expressed.""  One possible explanation for this difference is the ""more complex supposition…that Smith misused some key term, so his words did not fully match his intentions.""
If Smith misused a key term with the result that his words did not match his intentions, then he was mistaken about what the term meant.  Accordingly, it would be Smith's fault that Jones did not understand what Smith was saying, because Smith did not accurately communicate his message.  Therefore, the author's ""more complex supposition"" implies that speakers can fail to accurately convey the meaning of their ideas.
 By contrast, the author's ""more complex supposition"" does not imply that speakers:
are not responsible for whether listeners correctly interpret the meaning of their ideas (Choice A).  If ""Smith misused some key term,"" that would mean it was his fault that ""Jones and Smith possessed different opinions about what Smith had said"" (Paragraph 2).  Specifically, Smith's mistake about the term prevented Jones from understanding what Smith had meant.  Accordingly, the passage indicates that speakers can be responsible for whether listeners correctly interpret the meaning of their ideas.
cannot fail to accurately convey the meaning of their ideas (Choice B).  If ""Smith misused some key term"" (Paragraph 2), he would not have expressed what he meant correctly.  Accordingly, Smith would have failed to accurately convey the meaning of his ideas.
may sometimes be mistaken about the actual meaning of their ideas (Choice C).  The ""more complex supposition"" described in Paragraph 2 is that ""Smith misused some key term, so his words did not fully match his intentions.""  In this scenario, although Smith knew what ideas he wanted to convey, he was mistaken about the meaning of a word.  Hence, the passage makes a distinction between ideas and the words used to express them.  Paragraph 3 then states that ""in questions about what Smith meant….  Smith must be the authority.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that speakers are correct about the meaning of their ideas, even when they are mistaken about the meaning of a term."
"242","Which of the following statements, if true, would most support the passage author's argument about interpretation?","A","43","From the loftiest tomes of Shakespeare or Milton to the lowliest of yellowed paperbacks, authors produce works with a particular message in mind.  It is readers' task to discern that message, not to superimpose their own volitional perspectives. (Paragraph 4)
To think otherwise is to undermine the foundation of literary scholarship.  For what is the purpose of such scholarship, if not to seek understanding of an author's creation?  One examines the text, taking note of style, historical context, allusions to other works, and other factors, in addition, of course, to the surface sense of the words themselves.  If such an enterprise is to be reasonable, it must presume the existence of standards for success: accuracy and inaccuracy, depth or shallowness of analysis, grounds for preferring one interpretation to another.  Different readers may come to different conclusions about a text, it is true.  But to excise authorial intent from the evaluation of those conclusions does a disservice both to individual works and to literary study as a discipline. (Paragraph 5)
The passage author argues that an interpretation of a text is correct only when it matches the ""authorial intent"" behind the work (Paragraph 5).  For instance, Paragraph 4 states that ""authors produce works with a particular message in mind.  It is readers' task to discern that message, not to superimpose their own volitional (self-willed) perspectives.""  Similarly, Paragraph 5 suggests that the purpose of literary scholarship is to ""seek understanding of an author's creation,"" and that while doing so one ""must presume the existence of standards for success…grounds for preferring one interpretation to another.""
Therefore, the passage author's argument about interpretation would be supported if novelists often express confusion about the meanings people assign to their works.  Such a scenario would suggest that readers are misinterpreting the novels according to their own subjective ideas, rather than correctly identifying the authors' messages.
 By contrast, none of the following statements would support the passage author's argument about interpretation:
Poets often construct verses based on the way words sound regardless of their content (Choice B).  If poets cared only about how words sound rather than their meaning, that would indicate that the poets were unconcerned with what their poems actually say.  If so, this would contradict the passage author's claim that ""authors produce works with a particular message in mind"" (Paragraph 4).
Psychological studies suggest that authors are often unaware of their own motivations (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 3, ""[I]n questions about what Smith meant, it is surely Smith whose answer must be accepted….  On that count, Smith must be the authority.""  However, if authors are often unaware of their own motivations, that would imply that their works may include themes beyond what they consciously intended.  In that case, they would not necessarily be the authority on what their works meant; other people's differing interpretations might be accurate as well.
Interpretations of famous texts often differ widely between scholars and ordinary readers (Choice D).  Paragraph 4 asserts that a work's ""true meaning is whatever [an author] intended to convey"" by writing ""whatsoever object of literature a scholar (or ordinary reader) encounters.""  Thus, the passage author includes both scholars and ordinary readers when stating that ""[i]t is readers' task to discern [an author's] message.""  Although scholars might be more skilled at discerning such messages, that would not affect the claim that authorial intent determines a work's meaning.  Therefore, the passage author's argument would be neither supported nor weakened if scholars and ordinary readers often interpret famous texts differently."
"243","Based on the passage, a poetry student who encounters an established scholar's interpretation of a poem should do which of the following?","A","43","To think otherwise is to undermine the foundation of literary scholarship.  For what is the purpose of such scholarship, if not to seek understanding of an author's creation?  One examines the text, taking note of style, historical context, allusions to other works, and other factors, in addition, of course, to the surface sense of the words themselves.  If such an enterprise is to be reasonable, it must presume the existence of standards for success: accuracy and inaccuracy, depth or shallowness of analysis, grounds for preferring one interpretation to another.  Different readers may come to different conclusions about a text, it is true.  But to excise authorial intent from the evaluation of those conclusions does a disservice both to individual works and to literary study as a discipline. (Paragraph 5)
In Paragraph 5, the passage author stresses the need to examine multiple factors that contribute to how a work of literature should be understood.  For instance, they assert that ""the foundation of literary scholarship"" involves examining ""style, historical context, allusions to other works, and other factors, in addition, of course, to the surface sense of the words themselves.""
Furthermore, Paragraph 5 conveys that if ""[literary scholarship] is to be reasonable, it must presume the existence of…grounds for preferring one interpretation to another.""  Accordingly, the passage author suggests that there are standards by which interpretations of literary works should be analyzed and critiqued.  Therefore, based on the passage, a poetry student who encounters an established scholar's interpretation of a poem should evaluate the factors that might support or challenge that interpretation.
 (Choice B)  Develop their own personal interpretation of the poem.  Paragraph 1 describes the view that ""[i]t is readers…not authors, who create meaning, by interacting with a text rather than simply receiving it.  Thus, a reader transcends the aims of the author, producing their own reading of the text.""  However, the passage author strongly disagrees, asserting that ""[t]his view is nonsense.""  Therefore, the passage author would reject the idea that a poetry student should develop their own personal interpretation of the poem.
(Choice C)  Treat the scholar's greater experience as irrelevant to determining the best interpretation of the poem.  Paragraph 5 discusses ""standards for success"" in literary interpretation: ""accuracy and inaccuracy, depth or shallowness of analysis, grounds for preferring one interpretation to another.""  Although the passage author does not specifically discuss scholarly experience, it is reasonable to think that experienced scholars would be more skilled than general readers at analyzing works according to such standards.  Therefore, the passage author would likely not suggest treating a scholar's greater experience as irrelevant.
(Choice D)  Presume that the scholar's interpretation is probably correct.  According to Paragraph 5, ""If [literary scholarship] is to be reasonable, it must presume the existence of standards for success: accuracy and inaccuracy, depth or shallowness of analysis, grounds for preferring one interpretation to another.""  Thus, the passage author advocates thoroughly assessing any interpretation.  Consequently, they would likely oppose simply presuming an interpretation is probably correct."
"244","Suppose data shows that Japan's whaling industry is unprofitable and depends on government funding to maintain its operations.  What effect would this information have on the Australian view of Japanese whaling?","D","44","Consequently, Australian minds tend implicitly or explicitly to embrace the view that ""pro-whaling countries can lay no similar claim to being enlightened and humane.""  To engage in whaling is seen as treating a species as a source of financial gain rather than as creatures deserving protection, and ""since only the Japanese kill 'Australian Whales', they are the target of sustained demonization."" (Paragraph 2)
Naturally, the Japanese have their own view of the situation, which frames the issue differently.  Peace describes the significant cultural importance attached to Japanese whaling, noting that the tradition of consuming whale meat dates back thousands of years.  Moreover, supplies of whale meat enabled Japan to endure the effects of famine in the early twentieth century, as well as food shortages in the waning years of the Second World War.  For many reasons, whaling is ""valorized and preserved"" among ""the exceptional elements of Japanese culture."" (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 2, Australians condemn whaling as exploiting another species for commercial profit: ""whaling is seen as treating a species as a source of financial gain rather than as creatures deserving protection.""  Moreover, this attitude is especially pronounced toward Japanese whaling; in Adrian Peace's words, ""'[S]ince only the Japanese kill ""Australian Whales"", they are the target of sustained demonization.'""  Therefore, the Australian view portrays Japanese whaling as harming whales for financial motives.
However, if Japan's whaling industry is unprofitable and depends on government funding to maintain its operations, this fact would suggest that financial gain is not really the point of the whaling.  Instead, it would support the idea that Japan is motivated by ""the significant cultural importance attached to Japanese whaling,"" whereby that practice is ""'valorized and preserved.'""  In that case, the Australian view would be weakened because commercial profit would not be the reason for Japan's continued whaling operations.
 (Choice A)  The Australian view would be neither strengthened nor weakened because it makes no reference to whether whaling is government funded.  The Australian view is that Japanese whaling ""treat[s] a species as a source of financial gain rather than as creatures deserving protection"" (Paragraph 2).  Accordingly, although it is true that the view makes no reference to whether whaling is government funded, it does portray whaling as motivated by commercial profit.  Therefore, since the information that Japanese whaling is unprofitable would seem to disprove that motive, this information would still weaken the Australian view.
(Choice B)  The Australian view would be strengthened because Japan's whaling would result from official policies of its government.  Paragraph 2 describes ""[a]ntipathy (negative feelings) on both sides of…a decades-long maritime conflict"" between Australia and Japan over whaling.  However, the passage never suggests that Australian opposition to whaling has to do with whether the whaling results from official government policies.  Rather, ""Australian fervor for conservation"" would likely oppose ""Japan's annual whale hunts"" whether or not the Japanese government was involved.  Consequently, the Australian view would be unaffected by the information that Japan's whaling results from official policies of its government.
(Choice C)  The Australian view would be weakened because it is specifically commercial whaling that was banned by the International Whaling Commission.  According to Paragraph 3, ""[T]he International Whaling Commission voted in 1982 to end all commercial whaling by 1986, leaving only a few types of whaling permissible.""  However, Australia's negative view of Japanese whaling is not based on whether some types of whaling are banned by the International Whaling Commission.  Instead, that view is based on the belief that whaling immorally ""treat[s] a species as a source of financial gain rather than as creatures deserving protection"" (Paragraph 2).  Therefore, the fact that it is specifically commercial whaling that was banned by the International Whaling Commission is irrelevant to the Australian view."
"245","According to the author, it is unlikely that a compromise position between Australia and Japan over whale hunting will be realized soon.  Which of the following claims made in the passage most strongly supports the author's conclusion?","C","44","In Peace's words, ""identification with the totemized whale has become part of how Australians imagine themselves as decent and enlightened citizens in the contemporary world.""  Consequently, Australian minds tend implicitly or explicitly to embrace the view that ""pro-whaling countries can lay no similar claim to being enlightened and humane.""  To engage in whaling is seen as treating a species as a source of financial gain rather than as creatures deserving protection, and ""since only the Japanese kill 'Australian Whales', they are the target of sustained demonization."" (Paragraph 2)
Consequently, whereas Australian cultural identity has become entwined with opposition to whaling, in Japan hunting and eating whales constitute ""significant traditions which must be honoured.""  Given this stark societal difference, a compromise position is unlikely to be realized soon. (Paragraph 4)
For Australia and Japan to reach a compromise position, each side would need to make some concession to the other.  However, Paragraph 2 cites Peace's claim that supporting the protection of whales ""'has become part of how Australians imagine themselves as decent and enlightened citizens.'""  This view affects how Australians judge other people, as they ""tend implicitly or explicitly to embrace the view that 'pro-whaling countries can lay no similar claim to being enlightened and humane.'""  Accordingly, Australians have an extremely negative opinion of whaling, and ""'since only the Japanese kill ""Australian Whales"", they are the target of sustained demonization.'""
The phrase ""'sustained demonization'"" implies strong and persistent antagonism on matters of fundamental value, suggesting that the possibility of finding common ground is very slim.  Furthermore, if Australians believe that only those who oppose whaling are ""'decent and enlightened,'"" it is difficult to see how they could accept any amount of Japanese whaling.  Therefore, this passage claim most strongly supports the author's conclusion that ""a compromise position is unlikely to be realized soon"" (Paragraph 4).
 (Choice A)  ""[T]he Ady Gil's captain, Peter Bethune, was arrested after he boarded the Shonan Maru No. 2 and attempted to force the Japanese to pay for the loss of the Australian ship.""  This information describes only one incident in the ""decades-long maritime conflict"" between Australia and Japan over whaling (Paragraph 2).  Accordingly, while this event would contribute to tensions between the two countries, it would not in itself establish that ""a compromise position is unlikely to be realized soon"" (Paragraph 4).
(Choice B)  ""Australia is not the only country that has objected to Japan's whaling practices.""  According to Paragraph 3, the United States considered the Japanese ""to be acting in bad faith"" in claiming that they ""'would continue to take hundreds of minke whales each year for ""scientific purposes.""'""  However, the fact that other countries besides Australia have objected to Japan's whaling practices does not necessarily suggest anything about how soon a compromise might be reached between Australia and Japan in particular.
(Choice D)  ""'Save The Whales' is a long-touted, even clichéd, rallying cry of environmentalism.""  According to Paragraph 2, ""'Save The Whales'"" is a common environmentalist concern.  However, the author points out that the Australian view goes beyond this broader cause: ""Australia possesses its own particular sense of guardianship for the Antarctic whales that swim up its coastlines,"" which the Australians think of as ""'our whales.'""  Therefore, the difficulty of reaching a compromise between Australia and Japan has less to do with a general call to ""'Save The Whales,'"" and more to do with the belief that Japan kills ""'Australian Whales'"" specifically."
"246","The author's main purpose in the passage is most likely to:","D","44","In 2010, the Japanese vessel Shonan Maru No. 2 crashed into Australia's Ady Gil, severing eleven feet of the latter craft and causing it to sink. (Paragraph 1)
Antipathy on both sides of this encounter actually extends much farther than the crash, which represents merely one incident in a decades-long maritime conflict….  As anthropologist Adrian Peace points out, descriptions of these animals are ""suffused with anthropomorphism,"" in which ""our whales"" are ascribed with characteristics such as shyness or affection, and somehow imbued with the knowledge that the people of Australia want to keep them safe….  To engage in whaling is seen as treating a species as a source of financial gain rather than as creatures deserving protection, and ""since only the Japanese kill 'Australian Whales', they are the target of sustained demonization."" (Paragraph 2)
After initially refusing, Japan agreed to stop its commercial whaling in 1987 but ""immediately announced that it would continue to take hundreds of minke whales each year for 'scientific purposes.'""  Considering Japan to be acting in bad faith, U.S. president Ronald Reagan responded by revoking that country's rights to fish in United States waters. (Paragraph 3)
Peace describes the significant cultural importance attached to Japanese whaling, noting that the tradition of consuming whale meat dates back thousands of years….  For many reasons, whaling is ""valorized and preserved"" among ""the exceptional elements of Japanese culture.""  …Given this stark societal difference, a compromise position is unlikely to be realized soon. (Paragraph 4)
Throughout the passage, the author explains various aspects of the tensions between Australia and Japan over whaling.  Paragraph 1 recounts a collision in which ""the Japanese vessel Shonan Maru No. 2 crashed into Australia's Ady Gil…causing it to sink.""  This event is then located within the context of ""a decades-long maritime conflict"" between Australia and Japan (Paragraph 2), and the rest of the passage provides additional details about this conflict.
For instance, Paragraph 2 discusses how Australians envision themselves as protectors of ""'our whales,'"" who are ""somehow imbued with the knowledge that the people of Australia want to keep them safe.""  Accordingly, ""'since only the Japanese kill ""Australian Whales"", they are the target of sustained demonization.'""  Paragraph 3 adds that commercial whaling had been banned by the International Whaling Commission, and notes a widespread view that Japan was ""acting in bad faith"" by claiming it would continue whaling ""'for ""scientific purposes.""'""
Finally, Paragraph 4 describes the Japanese view of the conflict.  In Japan there is ""significant cultural importance attached"" to whaling, which is considered part of ""'the exceptional elements of Japanese culture.'""  Thus, whereas Australians view whaling as immoral, ""in Japan hunting and eating whales constitute 'significant traditions which must be honoured.'""  Given this extreme difference in values between Australia and Japan, the author ultimately concludes that ""a compromise position is unlikely to be realized soon.""
Consequently, the author's main purpose in the passage is to discuss the influences most relevant to Australia's conflict with Japan over whaling.
 By contrast, the author's main purpose in the passage is not to:
explain the events leading up to the crash of the Shonan Maru No. 2 and the Ady Gil (Choice A).  Paragraph 2 asserts that ""the crash…represents merely one incident in a decades-long maritime conflict"" between Australia and Japan.  Accordingly, the author mentions the crash of the Shonan Maru No. 2 and the Ady Gil as a way to introduce this broader conflict, which is the focus of most of the passage.  Moreover, although the passage describes this context surrounding the crash, it does not actually explain the events that led up to it.
clarify the less acknowledged Japanese perspective in Australia's conflict with Japan over whaling (Choice B).  In Paragraph 4, the author points out that ""the Japanese have their own view of the situation, which frames the issue differently.""  However, clarifying the Japanese perspective is only one part of the author's purpose in the passage, which also includes explaining the Australian perspective and the overall conflict between the two countries.
illustrate the leadership role played by Australia internationally in opposing commercial whaling (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 2, ""Australia possesses its own particular sense of guardianship for the Antarctic whales that swim up its coastlines.""  However, while Australians exhibit strong concern for what they think of as ""'our whales,'"" the passage never suggests that Australia has played an international leadership role in opposing commercial whaling."
"247","The author seems to imply that Japanese whaling:","A","44","…the International Whaling Commission voted in 1982 to end all commercial whaling by 1986, leaving only a few types of whaling permissible.  After initially refusing, Japan agreed to stop its commercial whaling in 1987 but ""immediately announced that it would continue to take hundreds of minke whales each year for 'scientific purposes.'""  Considering Japan to be acting in bad faith, U.S. president Ronald Reagan responded by revoking that country's rights to fish in United States waters.  Similarly, in 2000 the U.S. secretary of commerce, Norman Y. Mineta, wrote to President Bill Clinton that ""Japan's research program has dubious scientific validity….  Many suspect that Japan's motivation…has less to do with validation of scientific hypotheses and more to do with paving the way for outright resumption of commercial whaling."" (Paragraph 3)
Naturally, the Japanese have their own view of the situation, which frames the issue differently.  Peace describes the significant cultural importance attached to Japanese whaling….  Specifically, ""Eating whale meat represents an integral part of how the Japanese locate themselves in a world geared to the destruction of regional differences."" (Paragraph 4)
One aspect of the passage discussion concerns Japan's motives for engaging in whale hunts.  According to Paragraph 3, Japan claimed it would stop commercial whaling in response to a 1986 ban, but ""'immediately announced that it would continue to take hundreds of minke whales each year for ""scientific purposes.""'""  Other nations were skeptical of this response.  For example, U.S. Commerce Secretary Norman Y. Mineta wrote: ""'Many suspect that Japan's motivation…has less to do with validation of scientific hypotheses and more to do with paving the way for outright resumption of commercial whaling.'""
Paragraph 4 then notes that ""the Japanese have their own view of the situation, which frames the issue differently.""  However, the author provides no information to suggest that Japan's whaling really is motivated by scientific purposes.  Instead, the author discusses only ""the significant cultural importance attached to Japanese whaling.""  For example, they cite Adrian Peace's claims that ""whaling is 'valorized and preserved' among 'the exceptional elements of Japanese culture'"" and that ""'[e]ating whale meat represents an integral part of how the Japanese locate themselves in a world geared to the destruction of regional differences.'""
Accordingly, although the author never explicitly states a position about Japan's motivations, their description of these motivations focuses entirely on the cultural aspects of whaling, not on any scientific goals that whaling might achieve.  Therefore, the author seems to imply that Japanese whaling is not actually motivated by scientific purposes.
 (Choice B)  is largely a reaction to criticism from Australia.  According to Paragraph 2, Australia and Japan have been involved in ""a decades-long maritime conflict"" in which ""Japan's annual whale hunts are confronted by Australian fervor for conservation.""  However, the author never implies that the Japanese engage in whaling because they receive criticism from Australia.  Instead, the author conveys that Japan practices whaling due to its ""significant cultural importance"" (Paragraph 4), and that this practice leads to criticism from Australia.
(Choice C)  is important to maintaining the present food supply in Japan.  Paragraph 4 mentions the historical importance of Japanese whaling, as ""supplies of whale meat enabled Japan to endure the effects of famine in the early twentieth century, as well as food shortages in the waning years of the Second World War.""  However, although whaling was important for supplementing Japan's past food supply, the author never implies that whaling is important to maintaining the present food supply in Japan.
(Choice D)  is subjected to unjustified criticism.  In Paragraph 4, the author asserts: ""Naturally, the Japanese have their own view of [whaling], which frames the issue differently.""  However, acknowledging that Japan has its own view is not the same as endorsing that view.  Rather, the author explains the Japanese perspective after first explaining the Australian one, then concludes: ""Given this stark societal difference, a compromise position is unlikely to be realized soon.""  Thus, the point of the discussion is a factual claim about the two nations' differences; the author does not take a stance about whether either side has been criticized unjustly."
"248","According to the passage, the whaling conflict between Australia and Japan persists because of:
Japanese resistance to outside influence
The international ban on commercial whaling
Moral sentiments in Australia","C","44","""Save The Whales"" is a long-touted, even clichéd, rallying cry of environmentalism, but Australia possesses its own particular sense of guardianship for the Antarctic whales that swim up its coastlines….  In Peace's words, ""[I]dentification with the totemized whale has become part of how Australians imagine themselves as decent and enlightened citizens in the contemporary world.""  Consequently, Australian minds tend implicitly or explicitly to embrace the view that ""pro-whaling countries can lay no similar claim to being enlightened and humane.""  To engage in whaling is seen as treating a species as a source of financial gain rather than as creatures deserving protection, and ""since only the Japanese kill 'Australian Whales', they are the target of sustained demonization."" (Paragraph 2)
For many reasons, whaling is ""valorized and preserved"" among ""the exceptional elements of Japanese culture.""  Specifically, ""Eating whale meat represents an integral part of how the Japanese locate themselves in a world geared to the destruction of regional differences.  The anti-whaling rhetoric of countries like Australia and the United States is thus interpreted as a challenge to the right of the Japanese to live as they choose."" (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 describes the cultural importance of Japanese whaling, citing anthropologist Adrian Peace's explanation that ""'[e]ating whale meat represents an integral part of how the Japanese locate themselves in a world geared to the destruction of regional differences.'""  In other words, the Japanese perceive calls to stop whaling as outside forces threatening to destroy part of their distinct cultural heritage.  Thus, the desire to preserve this heritage motivates Japan to continue whaling despite ""'[t]he anti-whaling rhetoric of countries like Australia,'"" which is ""'interpreted as a challenge to the right of the Japanese to live as they choose.'""  Therefore, the whaling conflict between Australia and Japan persists partly because of Japanese resistance to outside influence (Number I).
Paragraph 2 discusses how concern for protecting whales has become intertwined with Australia's moral and social identity.  According to the author, Australia has ""its own particular sense of guardianship for the Antarctic whales that swim up its coastlines.""  Furthermore, this conservation is so culturally important that, as Peace asserts, it ""'has become part of how Australians imagine themselves as decent and enlightened citizens in the contemporary world.'""  Accordingly, most Australians have an extremely negative view of pro-whaling countries, and ""'since only the Japanese kill ""Australian Whales"", they are the target of sustained demonization.'""  Therefore, the whaling conflict between Australia and Japan persists in part because of moral sentiments in Australia (Number III).
 (Number II)  The international ban on commercial whaling.  According to Paragraph 3, ""[T]he International Whaling Commission voted in 1982 to end all commercial whaling by 1986, leaving only a few types of whaling permissible.""  However, the passage never suggests that the whaling conflict between Japan and Australia depends on whaling's legal status.  Rather, that conflict arises because these countries have opposing moral views about whaling.  Australians believe that only those who protect whales can be ""'decent and enlightened citizens'"" (Paragraph 2), while in Japan, whaling is ""'valorized and preserved' among 'the exceptional elements of Japanese culture'"" (Paragraph 4).
These contrasting cultural values would be in opposition regardless of whether whaling is legal or banned.  Accordingly, even if whaling were not banned, Australia would still make Japan ""'the target of sustained demonization'"" (Paragraph 2), while Japan would still take offense to ""'[t]he anti-whaling rhetoric of countries like Australia'"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, the existence of the international ban has little to do with the persistence of the whaling conflict between Australia and Japan."
"249","The main point of the passage is that:","B","45","To consult diverse interpretations is always a useful corrective against complacency in literary scholarship.  Reviewing alternative readings of a work helps remind us that questions regarding the work's meaning should seldom be viewed as settled but instead as opportunities for further inquiry. (Paragraph 1)
Nevertheless, another pitfall must be avoided as well.  The fear of missing genuine interpretive possibilities may lead one to imagine more differences in readings than truly exist, obscuring a hidden homogeneity among seemingly divergent understandings.  It has been said that to truly understand a people one must synthesize its stories; we must also acknowledge that to truly understand a story one must synthesize its interpretations. (Paragraph 2)
David McKee's deceptively rich Not Now, Bernard is an instructive example. (Paragraph 3)
Hence, whether the monster is literal or metaphorical, these seemingly divergent interpretations in fact exhibit a clear and striking coherence. (Paragraph 7)
The author begins by describing two related problems in interpretation, and recommending an approach to address them.  First, Paragraph 1 warns about ""complacency in literary scholarship"" and states that ""questions regarding the work's meaning should seldom be viewed as settled but instead as opportunities for further inquiry.""  Paragraph 2 then describes ""another pitfall"" that may be encountered, namely that engaging in this further inquiry ""may lead one to imagine more differences in readings than truly exist.""  As a result, the author asserts that different perspectives on a work's meaning must be incorporated into a more comprehensive whole: ""to truly understand a story one must synthesize its interpretations.""
The rest of the passage is devoted to exploring ""an instructive example"" (Paragraph 3) to illustrate this point about synthesizing interpretations.  The author analyzes the differences and similarities of Warner's and Hancock's perspectives on Not Now, Bernard, ultimately leading to the conclusion that ""these seemingly divergent interpretations in fact exhibit a clear and striking coherence"" (Paragraph 7).  Accordingly, this example constitutes a specific application of the author's approach to literary interpretation, arriving at a new understanding informed by views that initially seemed more at odds with each other.
Therefore, the main idea of the passage is that alternative interpretations of literary works should be synthesized into a coherent understanding.
 By contrast, all of the following statements represent supporting ideas rather than the main point of the passage:
alternative interpretations of literary works help to prevent complacency in scholarship (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 1,""To consult diverse interpretations is always a useful corrective against complacency in literary scholarship.""  However, the primary focus of the passage goes beyond this claim, stressing the further point that ""to truly understand a story one must synthesize its interpretations"" (Paragraph 2).
Warner and Hancock provide different but ultimately similar analyses of Not Now, Bernard (Choice C).  Paragraph 3 states that ""David McKee's deceptively rich Not Now, Bernard is an instructive example"" of the need to synthesize a story's interpretations.  Accordingly, the point of discussing Warner's and Hancock's analyses is to illustrate that type of synthesis.
questions about a literary work's meaning should generally be viewed as open and unsettled (Choice D).  In Paragraph 1 the author claims that ""questions regarding the work's meaning should seldom be viewed as settled.""  However, this statement serves to introduce the more comprehensive claim that ""to truly understand a story one must synthesize its interpretations"" (Paragraph 2)."
"250","Why does the author most likely mention the monster's ""bestial vocalization"" (Paragraph 6)?","D","45","Intriguingly, writer Sheila Hancock assumes that Bernard's parents are not oblivious.  On her interpretation no one has been eaten and replaced; rather, the monster is Bernard.  It is worth noting that of the two lines spoken by the monster, the first is simply ""ROAR,"" a bestial vocalization that makes little impression upon Bernard's mother (""Not now, Bernard"").  The human-sounding ""But I'm a monster"" comes later, after a series of events in which the presence of a monster in the house has been treated as unremarkable.  The apparent powerlessness of the monster to be perceived as anything but mundane suggests it could be merely the external manifestation of the child's frustrated psyche. (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 6 describes Sheila Hancock's view that the events of Not Now, Bernard are meant to be taken metaphorically: ""On her interpretation no one has been eaten and replaced; rather, the monster is Bernard.""  In discussing this possibility, the author points out that the monster's first line, ""ROAR,"" is ""a bestial vocalization that makes little impression upon Bernard's mother….  The human-sounding 'But I'm a monster' comes later, after a series of events in which the presence of a monster in the house has been treated as unremarkable.""  Thus, the author implies that Bernard's mother seems to find nothing unusual or surprising about the monster or its ""bestial vocalization.""
Therefore, the author portrays the story's dialogue as lending credence to the idea that the apparent monster ""could be merely the external manifestation of the child's frustrated psyche"" (ie, that the monster might be symbolic rather than literal).  If the monster is really Bernard, this would explain why his mother reacts no differently to a roar than to spoken human language.  Consequently, the author most likely mentions the monster's ""bestial vocalization"" (Paragraph 6) to help explain a reason why the monster might be viewed as metaphorical.
 (Choices A and C)  To help explain a potential flaw in Warner's psychological interpretation of the story; and To help illustrate why Hancock's interpretation of the story is preferable to Warner's.  Paragraph 7 states that ""on Hancock's symbolic interpretation of events…the latent psychological motivations identified by Warner would be just as operant.""  Therefore, the author views Warner's psychological analysis as essentially correct.  In addition, the author writes that ""whether the monster is literal or metaphorical, these seemingly divergent interpretations in fact exhibit a clear and striking coherence.""  Thus, he or she views Warner's and Hancock's interpretations as ultimately similar.  Accordingly, the author does not most likely refer to the monster's ""bestial vocalization"" (Paragraph 6) either to help explain a potential flaw in Warner's psychological interpretation of the story or to help illustrate why Hancock's interpretation of the story is preferable to Warner's.
(Choice B)  To help demonstrate that Bernard's parents do not see him as being like a monster.  Paragraph 5 relates Marina Warner's interpretation that ""Bernard's parents 'cannot tell the difference between a tiny tot and an angry beast, because the two are all the same to them: that is how they see Bernard.'""  Paragraph 7 further states that ""on Hancock's symbolic interpretation of events…the latent psychological motivations identified by Warner would be just as operant.""  Therefore, the author indicates that Bernard's parents do see him as being like a monster regardless of whether the monster is metaphorical."
"251","Based on the passage, with which of the following statements about the plot of Not Now, Bernard would the passage author most likely agree?","D","45","Thus Warner casts McKee's tale as an incisive commentary on ""parents who are so automatic in their oblivion—and rejection—that they do not notice when their child has been eaten."" (Paragraph 5)
Intriguingly, writer Sheila Hancock assumes that Bernard's parents are not oblivious.  On her interpretation no one has been eaten and replaced; rather, the monster is Bernard….  The apparent powerlessness of the monster to be perceived as anything but mundane suggests it could be merely the external manifestation of the child's frustrated psyche. (Paragraph 6)
Even so, Hancock's view would not completely absolve Bernard's parents….  [T]he latent psychological motivations identified by Warner would be just as operant.  Hence, whether the monster is literal or metaphorical, these seemingly divergent interpretations in fact exhibit a clear and striking coherence. (Paragraph 7)
The passage suggests that there are two ways in which the plot of Not Now Bernard can be interpreted.  For example, Marina Warner takes the events of the story literally, viewing it ""as an incisive commentary on 'parents who are so automatic in their oblivion—and rejection—that they do not notice when their child has been eaten.'""  By contrast, Paragraph 6 describes Sheila Hancock's view that the story is symbolic: ""no one has been eaten and replaced; rather, the monster is Bernard.""
However, the author points out that even on Hancock's interpretation ""the latent psychological motivations identified by Warner would be just as operant"" (Paragraph 7).  Moreover, he or she concludes by stating that ""whether the monster is literal or metaphorical, these seemingly divergent interpretations in fact exhibit a clear and striking coherence.""  Therefore, the author indicates that the plot of Not Now, Bernard is somewhat ambiguous, because it can be interpreted either literally or metaphorically.
 (Choice A)  It is derivative of many other stories.  Paragraph 3 relates the scene in the story where ""'[t]he monster ate Bernard up, every bit,'"" and Paragraph 4 follows by describing ""[t]he reader's shock at this turn of events.""  Accordingly, the author implies that the plot of Not Now, Bernard takes a surprising turn; he or she never suggests that it is derivative (ie, unoriginal or based on other works).
(Choices B and C)  It is difficult to understand; and It is non-linear.  Paragraph 3 conveys that the plot of Not Now, Bernard ""initially concerns the futile attempts of a child to gain his parents' attention,"" and that later ""[a] monster ate Bernard up, every bit.""  Although the author considers the question of ""whether the monster is literal or metaphorical"" (Paragraph 7), he or she never suggests that the plot is either non-linear or difficult to understand."
"252","Literary scholarship has always included debate about how the standard interpretation of a work should be determined.  Which of the following conceptions is most in accord with the main idea of the passage?","B","45","To consult diverse interpretations is always a useful corrective against complacency in literary scholarship.  Reviewing alternative readings of a work helps remind us that questions regarding the work's meaning should seldom be viewed as settled but instead as opportunities for further inquiry. (Paragraph 1)
It has been said that to truly understand a people one must synthesize its stories; we must also acknowledge that to truly understand a story one must synthesize its interpretations. (Paragraph 2)
One aspect of the passage's main idea is that different interpretations of a work should influence the way in which that work is understood.  For example, when discussing literary scholarship in Paragraph 1, the author highlights the need to ""consult diverse interpretations"" of a work in order to avoid ""complacency"" in one's thinking.  Similarly, he or she asserts that ""questions of meaning should seldom be viewed as settled but instead as opportunities for further inquiry.""  Hence, the passage describes interpretation as an ongoing process which should incorporate additional perspectives over time.
This idea is reinforced in Paragraph 2, which suggests that ""to truly understand a story one must synthesize its interpretations.""  The remainder of the passage then illustrates this synthesizing process in relation to the story Not Now, Bernard.  Therefore, the passage view about how the standard interpretation of a work should be determined is most in accord with a developmental conception, where the standard interpretation is continually subject to revision.
 (Choice A)  An individualist conception, where the standard interpretation is whatever each reader prefers it to be.  Paragraph 2 states that ""to truly understand a story one must synthesize its interpretations.""  Accordingly, the passage indicates that readers should take multiple interpretations of a work into account, and that those differing interpretations contribute to determining how a work should ultimately be understood.  Hence, the passage does not suggest that the standard interpretation should simply be based on each reader's individual preference.
(Choices C and D)  A consensus conception, where the majority view determines the standard interpretation; and An expert conception, where the most established scholars determine the standard interpretation.  The passage describes the problem of ""complacency in literary scholarship,"" and argues that ""questions regarding the work's meaning should seldom be viewed as settled but instead as opportunities for further inquiry"" (Paragraph 1).  Thus, the passage portrays literary interpretation as an ongoing process that continues to yield new insights over time.  Accordingly, the main idea of the passage is not reflected in the claims that the standard interpretation of a work is determined by a majority consensus or by the most established scholars."
"253","Which of the following, if true, would most challenge Marina Warner's analysis of the events in Not Now, Bernard (Paragraph 5)?","A","45","Likewise, Bernard's parents ""cannot tell the difference between a tiny tot and an angry beast because the two are all the same to them: that is how they see Bernard.""  Thus Warner casts McKee's tale as an incisive commentary on ""parents who are so automatic in their oblivion—and rejection—that they do not notice when their child has been eaten."" (Paragraph 5)
Intriguingly, writer Sheila Hancock assumes that Bernard's parents are not oblivious.  On her interpretation no one has been eaten and replaced; rather, the monster is Bernard….  The apparent powerlessness of the monster to be perceived as anything but mundane suggests it could be merely the external manifestation of the child's frustrated psyche. (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 5, Marina Warner interprets the plot of Not Now, Bernard literally: the monster in the story is an ""angry beast""  that actually eats the ""tiny tot"" Bernard.  Hence, she analyzes Not Now, Bernard in terms of ""'parents who are so automatic in their oblivion…that they do not notice when their child has been eaten.'""  By contrast, Paragraph 6 describes Sheila Hancock's interpretation that the monster is symbolic rather than literal: ""no one has been eaten and replaced; rather, the monster is Bernard.""
If the monster in the story saw Bernard's reflection in the mirror, it would suggest that the monster really was Bernard, and represented ""merely the external manifestation of the child's frustrated psyche"" (Paragraph 6).  In other words, the monster would be symbolic rather than the literal, separate being that Warner interprets it to be.  Therefore, Marina Warner's analysis would be most challenged if at the end of Not Now, Bernard, the monster sees Bernard's reflection in the mirror.
 By contrast, none of the following scenarios would challenge Warner's analysis:
Melanie Klein never actually mentions Not Now, Bernard in discussing her psychoanalytic theories (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 5, Warner references ""the psychoanalytic theories of Melanie Klein.""  However, the passage never indicates that Klein herself discusses Not Now, Bernard in relation to those theories.
Bernard's parents never actually look directly at either Bernard or the monster (Choice C).  This failure to look at Bernard or the monster would be consistent with Warner's description of ""'parents who are so automatic in their oblivion…that they do not notice when their child has been eaten'"" (Paragraph 5).
At the end of Not Now, Bernard, the monster eats Bernard's parents (Choice D).  If the monster ate Bernard's parents, this would support Warner's interpretation that the monster is a literal entity rather than ""merely the external manifestation of the child's frustrated psyche"" (Paragraph 6)."
"254","The author's claim about the ""hidden homogeneity"" of some interpretations (Paragraph 2) is most like:","D","45","Nevertheless, another pitfall must be avoided as well.  The fear of missing genuine interpretive possibilities may lead one to imagine more differences in readings than truly exist, obscuring a hidden homogeneity among seemingly divergent understandings. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 describes a tendency in literary interpretation to ""imagine more differences in readings than truly exist, obscuring a hidden homogeneity among seemingly divergent understandings.""  In other words, the author points out that multiple interpretations of a work might seem to be very different, but in fact contain a high degree of similarity (ie, homogeneity).  Accordingly, ""hidden homogeneity"" refers to an underlying similarity between ideas that at first appear to be significantly different.
Likewise, the policy positions of rival political candidates might seem quite different but in fact be much more similar, undercutting the initial appearance of significant distinction between them.  Consequently, the author's claim about the hidden homogeneity of some interpretations is most like the observation that the policy positions of rival political candidates are frequently very similar.
 By contrast, none of the following exemplifies an underlying similarity between entities that initially appeared more different:
the recognition that works of art tend to be more highly valued by art historians than by members of the general public (Choice A).  This tendency illustrates a difference in two groups' evaluations, rather than a similarity between groups whose evaluations appeared to be different.
the understanding that the same piece of reporting is typically published by several news outlets (Choice B).  A piece of reporting that is published by several news outlets would constitute multiple retellings of the same news story; it would not represent a similarity between news stories that initially appeared more different.
the concern that increasing globalization may cause a loss of an individual culture's distinctive character and practices (Choice C).  The author warns that one may ""imagine more differences in readings than truly exist, obscuring a hidden homogeneity among seemingly divergent understandings"" (Paragraph 2).  Therefore, the author's concern is that similarity between ideas may be overlooked; he or she does not express concern that the distinctive character of an interpretation may be lost."
"255","Based on the passage author's description, ""naturalistic"" explanations of magical beliefs:","C","46","Fictional exceptions aside, superstitions still hold sway in many people's minds.  However, over time the spread of knowledge can be expected to refute magical beliefs; thus humankind can only benefit from naturalistic explanations.  For example, to walk under a ladder is indeed ""unlucky"" because doing so is dangerous.  An umbrella opened indoors may strike objects in the enclosed space without any mystical forces to cause this ""misfortune."" (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 6 describes ""naturalistic explanations"" as part of ""the spread of knowledge [that] can be expected to refute magical beliefs.""  The passage provides two examples of such naturalistic explanations: (1) ""to walk under a ladder is indeed 'unlucky' because doing so is dangerous.""  (2) ""An umbrella opened indoors may strike objects in the enclosed space without any mystical forces to cause this 'misfortune.'""
Accordingly, behaviors that are superstitiously seen as ""unlucky"" are described in terms of their purely physical (ie, natural) effects rather than as the result of ""mystical forces"" (Paragraph 6).  Therefore, based on the passage author's description, ""naturalistic"" explanations of magical beliefs interpret superstitions in terms of physical phenomena.
By contrast, the passage author does not indicate that ""naturalistic"" explanations of magical beliefs:
associate superstitions with the cultural traditions surrounding them (Choice A).  The author mentions superstitions in various cultures, such as the ""Roman citizens [who] thought that sleeping next to pieces of iron could prevent nightmares,"" and the ""ancient Chinese [who] believed they could predict the future by analyzing fractures in animal bones"" (Paragraph 1).  However, naturalistic explanations serve as a way to ""refute magical beliefs"" (Paragraph 6), not as a way to associate those beliefs with cultural traditions.
connect superstitions to their origins in human nature (Choice B).  The author notes that ""[s]ome may simply conclude that humanity is inherently prone to superstition"" (Paragraph 6), suggesting that humans have a natural tendency to believe in superstitions.  However, the author describes some explanations of magical beliefs as ""naturalistic"" because they refer to physical events rather than ""mystical forces"" (Paragraph 6).
describe superstitions in relation to individual psychology (Choice D).  Although Paragraph 6 states that ""superstitions still hold sway in many people's minds,"" the author never connects naturalistic explanations to any individual's psychology."
"256","By creating a ""substitious"" character in the novel Jingo, Pratchett highlights the idea that:","A","46","Some may simply conclude that humanity is inherently prone to superstition.  In the novel Jingo, author Terry Pratchett emphasized this point by describing an exception: his character Ahmed was ""substitious.""  In contrast to being superstitious, Ahmed ""believed instead in the things that were true in which no one else believed.""  Fictional exceptions aside, superstitions still hold sway in many people's minds. (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 6 states that ""[s]ome may simply conclude that humanity is inherently prone to superstition,"" and notes that ""[i]n the novel Jingo, author Terry Pratchett emphasized this point by describing an exception: his character Ahmed was 'substitious.'""  Ahmed is an ""exception"" because he did not partake in the superstitious thinking inherent to humanity and instead served as a ""contrast"" to this thinking by believing ""in the things that were true in which no one else believed.""  Therefore, by creating this ""substitious"" character as an exception to the rule that humans are superstitious, Pratchett highlights the idea that superstitions feature prominently in human thinking.
(Choice B)  According to the passage, Pratchett implies that ""humanity is inherently prone to superstition"" and portrays his ""substitious"" character as a fictional exception to this common human tendency (Paragraph 6).  This view of humanity would suggest that superstitions are likely to continue over time rather than become increasingly rare.
(Choice C)  The passage states that ""[t]he most straightforward assumption would be that superstition results from causal fallacies"" and that ""empirical observations can easily lead to mistaken connections in the human mind"" (Paragraph 1).  Accordingly, the passage suggests that superstitions arise from logical errors made about the cause of an event.  However, Pratchett's idea of being ""substitious"" does not make reference to such mistakes.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 7 suggests that Pratchett thinks ""human tendencies"" include believing in superstition.  However, the passage discussion of Pratchett's ""substitious"" character Ahmed does not mention anything about whether superstitions manifest as conscious or subconscious beliefs."
"257","The author describes humans acting from a ""skewed"" sort of rationality.  Which of the following scenarios most exemplifies this type of thinking?","D","46","One potential motive for superstitious belief does not truly stem from belief at all, but purely pragmatic concerns like those described by William James or Blaise Pascal.  A person might decide that there is nothing to lose from acting based on a superstition; therefore, one might as well heed it ""just in case"" there really is an associated causal effect.  On those grounds, following the superstition would involve a sort of rationality.  If one's situation is sufficiently desperate, such thinking would be all the more appealing.  However, the rationality is a skewed one, and to act on it prizes wishful thinking over reason. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 describes a ""potential motive for superstitious belief [that] does not truly stem from belief at all.""  One might ""decide that there is nothing to lose from acting based on a superstition,"" and thus follow it ""'just in case' there really is an associated causal effect.""  The passage notes that such thinking ""would involve a sort of rationality,"" especially if ""one's situation is sufficiently desperate.""  However, the author states that ""the rationality is a skewed one, and to act on it prizes wishful thinking over reason.""
Therefore, the ""skewed"" sort of rationality that the author describes means following an unreasonable idea because one wants it to succeed (ie, engaging in wishful thinking).  Accordingly, a father who turns to unlicensed doctors to treat his terminally ill son most exemplifies this concept.  Typically, it would be unreasonable to turn to unlicensed doctors for proper medical treatment.  However, the fact that the son is terminally ill implies that medical professionals are unable to prevent him from dying.  Consequently, the father has nothing to lose and prizes wishful thinking over reason, seeking the unlicensed doctors just in case doing so could save his son.
By contrast, none of the following situations most exemplifies the ""skewed"" sort of rationality because they do not involve prizing wishful thinking over reason:
A writer eats the same three meals daily to increase her ability to focus on work without distraction (Choice A).  Eating the same meals every day would eliminate the need to decide what to eat, enabling the writer to focus her attention on other things.  Accordingly, such a schedule could be expected to make it easier for the writer to focus on work without distraction.  Hence, there is no indication that this situation involves engaging in wishful thinking.
Miners continue working in an area because a geologist insists that the region contains minerals (Choice B).  A geologist would be a reliable source of information about minerals in an area.  Accordingly, the miners would be acting reasonably in continuing their work.
A client asks his stockbroker to change his investment plan as retirement approaches (Choice C).  Such a client would not be engaging in wishful thinking but simply (and reasonably) planning for an impending life event."
"258","Paragraph 3 describes Saint Augustine as rejecting astrological predictions because of ""a slave and a noble who had been born under the same stars.""  Augustine's reasoning in this rejection was that:","A","46","Standards of science-based experimentation are second nature today but were largely absent a millennium or more prior to the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Renaissance.  Still, that is not to say that such methods were entirely unheard of.  Saint Augustine rejected astrological predictions in the fourth century after learning of a slave and a noble who had been born under the same stars.  Clearly, his conclusion was based on an inference from observed fact. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 states that ""Saint Augustine rejected astrological predictions in the fourth century after learning of a slave and a noble who had been born under the same stars,"" and describes Augustine's conclusion as ""based on an inference from observed fact.""  The observed fact was that the two people had very different destinies (ie, one was a slave and the other was a noble), even though the position of the stars was the same when they were born.
Because Augustine's rejection of astrological predictions was based on this difference in destiny, it is clear that he believed the two individuals' destinies should have been the same if such predictions were accurate.  Therefore, Augustine's reasoning was that being born under the same stars should have led to identical destinies.
(Choice B)  In Paragraph 3, Augustine is introduced as a ""[s]aint,"" suggesting that he was a religious person who believed in the spiritual aspect of the heavens.  However, although Augustine rejected predictions about destiny according to astrology (ie, based on physical stars), the passage makes no mention of whether he believed that a child's destiny was instead determined by the spiritual heavens.
(Choice C)  According to Paragraph 3, ""Saint Augustine rejected astrological predictions in the fourth century after learning of a slave and a noble who had been born under the same stars.""  Therefore, Augustine rejected the idea that the stars have a bearing on a person's destiny, rather than concluding that the patterns of the stars were too complex for destiny to be interpreted reliably.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 3 states that Augustine ""rejected astrological predictions…based on an inference from observed fact.""  However, the passage does not discuss Augustine's views regarding either how to make accurate predictions or the physical causes of phenomena."
"259","The passage implies which of the following ideas about superstition?","C","46","The most straightforward assumption would be that superstition results from causal fallacies.  One event is seen to have followed another, but this sequence may simply be chance.  As Hume warned, empirical observations can easily lead to mistaken connections in the human mind. (Paragraph 1)
Saint Augustine rejected astrological predictions in the fourth century after learning of a slave and a noble who had been born under the same stars.  Clearly, his conclusion was based on an inference from observed fact. (Paragraph 3)
Given such clarifications, superstitions should lose appeal, despite what Pratchett implies about human tendencies.  Genuine causal connections can be distinguished from fallacious ones, and empirical observations can expose superstitions as errors rather than engendering them. (Paragraph 7)
Paragraph 1 suggests that ""superstition results from causal fallacies"" because when ""[o]ne event is seen to have followed another…empirical observations can easily lead to mistaken connections in the human mind.""  Thus, the passage indicates that empirical observations cause superstitions to arise.
However, the passage also indicates that empirical observations help to refute superstitions.  For instance, Paragraph 3 states that Augustine rejected a superstitious belief ""based on an inference from observed fact.""  In addition, Paragraph 7 states more generally that ""empirical observations can expose superstitions as errors.""
Therefore, the passage implies that superstitious beliefs are refuted by empirical observations, which are also what causes them to arise.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 4 conveys that both adults and children are superstitious, stating that ""adults laugh at children's reluctance to step on cracks in the pavement but build skyscrapers such as New York's Macmillan Building, where Floor 12 is followed by Floor 14.""  However, the passage does not indicate that superstitious beliefs are more common in adults than they are in children.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 3 states that ""Saint Augustine rejected astrological predictions…based on an inference from observed fact,"" and that ""Lucretius attributed disease to material causes, not supernatural forces.""  Therefore, the passage conveys that Augustine and Lucretius were past figures who rejected superstition by thinking scientifically.  However, the passage never indicates that such thinkers lessened superstition among people of the past in general.  In fact, given the further claim that ""even contemporary knowledge has not eliminated magical beliefs"" (Paragraph 4), the passage suggests that superstition has persisted in spite of such scientific thinkers.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 4 states that ""contemporary knowledge has not eliminated magical beliefs,"" and gives the example that ""[u]niversity graduates can describe the physical laws governing the world but refuse to watch a sporting event without wearing a 'lucky' shirt.""  Therefore, the passage suggests that modern people are often superstitious in spite of their scientific knowledge."
"260","Which of the following passage statements would most suggest that the passage is one part of a longer work?","D","46","The most straightforward assumption would be that superstition results from causal fallacies.  One event is seen to have followed another, but this sequence may simply be chance.  As Hume warned, empirical observations can easily lead to mistaken connections in the human mind.  This erroneous type of reasoning has occurred throughout history. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 begins by stating: ""The most straightforward assumption would be that superstition results from causal fallacies.""  By starting with this sentence, the passage provides what appears to be either the answer to a question (eg, ""What causes belief in superstition?"") or a conclusion to a previous analysis (eg, ""Most superstitions share the following features in common…"").  Hence, Paragraph 1 suggests the existence of an ongoing discussion concerning the cause of superstition to which ""the most straightforward assumption"" would be a continuation or response.  Therefore, it is this passage statement that would most strongly suggest the passage is part of a longer text.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 2 discusses how ""the persistence of superstition in society seems mysterious"" given that ""[s]uperstitions should quickly vanish after continued observations.""  The fact that ""superstitions are not so easily dispelled"" despite such observations is then described as having been ""lamented"" by ""scientist Francis Bacon.""  Accordingly, when Paragraph 3 states ""[i]n light of those points, it must be remembered that a scientific mindset is essentially a modern privilege,"" that quote refers to the discussion in Paragraph 2, not to a discussion from a longer version of the text.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 3 states that ""a scientific mindset is essentially a modern privilege,"" and describes superstitions of the past such as ""astrological predictions in the fourth century"" and the ancient idea that ""attributed disease…to supernatural forces.""  Accordingly, when Paragraph 4 states, ""Yet even contemporary knowledge has not eliminated magical beliefs,"" that statement continues the discussion of superstition in relation to modern knowledge; it does not suggest the passage is part of a longer text.
(Choice C)  According to paragraph 2, ""if causal fallacies are to blame for such beliefs, then the persistence of superstition in society seems mysterious.""  Paragraph 2 then further clarifies: ""Superstitions should quickly vanish after continued observations.""  Hence, the second statement refers to the preceding one rather than to anything outside of the passage."
"261","The author's view of Simeon's unusual religious practice is most likely that:","B","47","The son of a shepherd from the Amanus Mountains of Syria, Simeon joined a monastic community at the age of 16 but felt called to a more reclusive and stringent mode of existence.  Withdrawing to a nearby hut, he took up such self-mortifying practices as abstaining from food and drink throughout the whole of Lent and standing upright for as long as possible.  After three years of this voluntary confinement, he settled upon a rocky prominence in the desert where he continued his practice, at times overwhelmed by the pilgrims who thronged to hear his spiritual counsel. (Paragraph 2)
When Simeon spied a pillar amidst the ancient ruins of the surrounding area, he contrived a new, radical method of sequestration by constructing a small platform at the top of the column where he could stand.  There he vowed to live out the remainder of his days, exposed to every vagary of weather. (Paragraph 3)
Moreover, the pathos of the stylite's demise was testimony to his conviction.  As Edward Gibbon relates in his history of the Roman Empire, ""The progress of an ulcer in [his] thigh might shorten, but could not disturb, this celestial life, and the patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column."" (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 2 states that ""Simeon joined a monastic community at the age of 16 but felt called to a more reclusive and stringent mode of existence,"" prompting him to withdraw and become a stylite.  Paragraph 2 also conveys that later on ""pilgrims…thronged to hear [Simeon's] spiritual counsel.""  According to Paragraph 3, Simeon then ""contrived (devised) a new, radical method of sequestration (seclusion)…at the top of [a] column,"" where he ""vowed to live out the remainder of his days"" despite the fact that he was ""exposed to every vagary of weather.""
Furthermore, in Paragraph 5 the author notes that the manner of Simeon's ""demise (death)"" proved nothing less than a ""testimony to his conviction.""  To support this claim, the author offers Edward Gibbon's comment that even ""'[t]he progress of an ulcer…might shorten, but could not disturb, this celestial (pertaining to the sky or heavens) life, and the patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column.'""
Accordingly, this passage information demonstrates that the author's view of Simeon's unusual religious practice is most likely that it served some spiritual and personal purpose.
By contrast, the author's view of Simeon's unusual religious practice is not most likely that:
it was a way to compensate for his tendency toward pridefulness(Choice A).  In Paragraph 6, the author cites a Tennyson poem in which Simeon ""boasts, 'Show me the man hath suffered more than I.'""  Tennyson thus implies that Simeon was prideful in his suffering but does not imply that the stylite suffered as a way to compensate for prideful tendencies.  Moreover, the poet's view is not clearly identified with the author's view.
it was the best means by which a solitary could show devotion (Choice C).  The author never evaluates or ranks the different religious practices of recluses or ""solitaries"" (Paragraph 2).
it evolved out of his intense dislike for others (Choice D).  Paragraph 2 states that Simeon ""felt called to a more reclusive and stringent mode of existence,"" and it was this calling that prompted him to withdraw from monastic society and become a stylite.  Although Paragraph 2 also notes that Simeon could ""at times"" be ""overwhelmed by the pilgrims who thronged to hear his spiritual counsel,"" the passage never implies that he had an intense dislike for others."
"262","The author probably mentions the proto-stylites in order to show that:","C","47","Simeon was not, however, without precursors.  Among purported proto-stylites was Epidus, a recluse from Palestine who dwelt in a mountaintop cave for 25 years.  Saint Gregory of Nazianzus told of a fourth-century solitary who stood for years without lying down.  Theodoret, Simeon's contemporary and Bishop of Cyrus, reported that a hermit had lived for 10 years inside a tub suspended in midair by poles. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 states that ""Simeon was not…without precursors"" and provides three examples: ""a recluse…who dwelt in a mountaintop cave for 25 years""; ""a fourth-century solitary who stood for years without lying down""; and a hermit who ""had lived for 10 years inside a tub suspended in midair by poles.""  However, the passage never discusses the practices of these ""precursors"" of Simeon or ""proto-stylites.""
Consequently, the author probably mentions the proto-stylites in order to show that extreme forms of seclusion had been undertaken before.
By contrast, the author probably does not mention the proto-stylites in order to show that:
new types of self-mortification were cultivated to draw attention (Choice A).  Paragraph 2 states that Simeon ""felt called to a more reclusive and stringent mode of existence"" and so withdrew from the monastic community and took up ""self-mortifying practices"" (ie, self-inflicted physical punishment for the purpose of spiritual purification).  Although the descriptions of the proto-stylites' practices in Paragraph 5 might imply that Simeon's precursors attracted attention with their behavior, the passage does not suggest that these new types of self-mortification were deliberately cultivated to draw such attention.
prominent recluses imitated the practices of their predecessors (Choice B).  The descriptions of the various proto-stylites' practices reveal that these precursors employed modes of self-discipline, such as standing ""for years without lying down,"" that were similar to Simeon's.  However, the passage never implies that the similarities were the result of imitation.
a life of seclusion could enhance one's spiritual purpose (Choice D).  Paragraph 4 describes the secluded lifestyles of various proto-stylites, such as, ""liv[ing] for 10 years inside a tub suspended in midair by poles,"" but the passage never suggests that a life of seclusion can actually enhance one's spiritual purpose."
"263","Based on the passage, ""certain critics"" (Paragraph 5) would have judged that:","D","47","Although certain critics deemed this lifestyle a pointless, self-willed martyrdom, he won the veneration of Emperor Theodosius. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 states that ""certain critics deemed [Simeon's] lifestyle a pointless, self-willed martyrdom.""  In other words, these critics viewed the stylite's practice as a form of self-imposed suffering that served no greater purpose.  Therefore, based on the passage, ""certain critics"" would have judged that radical self-denial was erroneously (mistakenly) thought to demonstrate piety.
By contrast, this passage information does not suggest ""certain critics"" would have judged that:
self-denial would likely diminish rather than increase the veneration one receives (Choice A).  Paragraph 5 indicates that Simeon ""won the veneration (great respect or reverence) of the Emperor Theodosius,"" suggesting that self-denial, though devalued by ""certain critics"" as ""pointless"" and ""self-willed,"" might increase the amount of veneration one receives.  However, this information does not imply that self-denial would instead likely diminish the veneration one receives.
self-denial had more to do with desire for fame than it did with piety(Choice B).  According to the passage, Simeon ""gained world renown"" (Paragraph 2) and his ""fame spread throughout the Byzantine…Empire"" (Paragraph 5).  However, while Simeon did achieve fame through his practice of self-denial, the criticism in the passage suggests only that this self-denial was ""pointless"" and ""self-willed"" (Paragraph 5), not that it was actually motivated by a desire for fame.
the result of self-denial is to diminish piety(Choice C).  Although the criticism implies that self-denial does not demonstrate piety, it does not suggest that self-denial actually diminishes piety."
"264","The passage suggests that Simeon's pioneering stint in vertical reclusion:
elicited displeasure from contemporary authorities.
offered Tennyson a powerful emblem of self-glorifying martyrdom.
may have served for Alypius partly as a goal for which to strive.","B","47","Simeon inspired more than a few imitators….  In the sixth century, Simeon's feat was surpassed by Alypius, who is said to have dwelt atop his pillar for a total of 67 years, the last 14 of which he spent lying down.  Nevertheless, it was Simeon's reputation that, for better or worse, endured.  In 1833, the English poet Tennyson composed an ironic verse in which the stylite boasts, ""Show me the man hath suffered more than I."" (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 6, ""Tennyson composed an ironic verse in which [Simeon] the stylite boasts, 'Show me the man hath suffered more than I.'""  This quote implies that, in Tennyson's view, Simeon thought that he had surpassed all other religious recluses in the extremity of his self-denying practices and suffering and, therefore, considered himself a great martyr (ie, someone who willingly endures suffering for the sake of his or her beliefs).  Consequently, the passage suggests that Simeon's pioneering stint in vertical reclusion offered Tennyson a powerful emblem of self-glorifying martyrdom (Number II).
Paragraph 6 states that ""Simeon inspired more than a few imitators"" and specifically that his ""feat was surpassed by Alypius, who is said to have lived atop his pillar for a total of 67 years.""  As Simeon's own stint was only ""37 years"" (Paragraph 5), Alypius' total time atop his column was indeed far longer than his predecessor's.  Accordingly, the passage suggests that Simeon's pioneering stint in vertical reclusion may have served the stylite Alypius partly as a goal for which to strive (Number III).
(Number I)  Paragraph 5 states that Simeon ""won the veneration (great respect or reverence) of Emperor Theodosius,"" thus providing an example of a contemporary authority showing respect for Simeon.  Therefore, the passage does not support the idea that Simeon's pioneering stint in vertical reclusion elicited (drew forth) displeasure from contemporary authorities."
"265","In affirming Simeon's life as a stylite, Gibbon points out in Paragraph 5 that ""the patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column.""  Gibbon's statement suggests that:","A","47","Moreover, the pathos of the stylite's demise was testimony to his conviction.  As Edward Gibbon relates in his history of the Roman Empire, ""The progress of an ulcer in [his] thigh might shorten, but could not disturb, this celestial life, and the patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column."" (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 states that ""the pathos (quality of evoking pity or sorrow) of the stylite's demise (death) was testimony to his conviction ""  Furthermore, according to Paragraph 5, ""Gibbon relates in his history of the Roman Empire, 'The progress of an ulcer in [Simeon's] thigh might shorten, but could not disturb""' the stylite's commitment to life atop a pillar.  Gibbon concludes by noting that ""'the patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column.'""  This information demonstrates that despite his dire physical condition, Simeon was determined to continue his self-denial, thus underscoring the willpower he had had to exert.
Accordingly, Gibbon's statement that ""the patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column"" suggests that to be a successful stylite, one must exert an iron will.
(Choices B and D)  Gibbon expresses admiration for Simeon's willpower in persevering in his pillar-dwelling practice despite '""the progress of an ulcer in [his] thigh""' (Paragraph 5).  However, Gibbon draws no comparisons between types of religious recluses with regard to the degree of admiration their practice could inspire or the degree of devoutness (commitment to religious practices) they displayed.
(Choice C)  Gibbon's statement that ""the patient Hermit expired, without descending from his column"" emphasizes the stylite's need to exert an iron will in order to remain atop his pillar.  However, the statement does not refer explicitly to piety (devoutness) nor suggest that its achievement demands relying on a deeper sense of purpose."
"266","The passage information about eleventh-century Chinese statesman Wang An-shih is mentioned as evidence for the idea that:","A","48","As time passes, however, the wealth or destitution of one generation is bequeathed to the next, and then inequality becomes ingrained. (Paragraph 5)
Such effects only compound over time.  Inevitably, dynasties of wealth accrue by which a few through mere circumstance enjoy economic mastery over the many, who face through the tyranny of chance an undeserved impediment. (Paragraph 6)
This same concern has led various leaders throughout history to implement socialism.  For instance, eleventh-century Chinese statesman Wang An-shih instituted state control of the economy ""with a view to succoring the working classes and preventing them from being ground into dust by the rich."" (Paragraph 7)
According to the author, there are certain economic disparities that arise in every society.  In particular, as wealth passes from one generation to another, ""inequality becomes ingrained"" (Paragraph 5) such that ""[i]nevitably, dynasties of wealth accrue by which a few through mere circumstance enjoy economic mastery over the many"" (Paragraph 6).  Hence, the author claims that societies inevitably face the challenge of socioeconomic inequality developing over time.
Paragraph 7 then states that concern over this issue ""has led various leaders throughout history to implement socialism.""  The author cites eleventh-century Chinese statesman Wang An-shih as a specific example of such a leader, emphasizing that he instituted socialist policies ""'with a view to succoring (aiding) the working classes and preventing them from being ground into dust by the rich.'""  Accordingly, this information about Wang An-shih is mentioned as evidence for the idea that socialism attempts to address a challenge that societies have always faced.
 (Choice B)  dynasties of wealth remain a uniquely American problem.  In Paragraph 6, the author states that ""[i]nevitably, dynasties of wealth accrue by which a few through mere circumstance enjoy economic mastery over the many.""  However, he or she never suggests that this problem is unique to America.  Rather, the author portrays this situation as resulting whenever ""the wealth or destitution of one generation is bequeathed to the next"" (Paragraph 5), implying that this dynastic wealth will arise in any society.
(Choice C)  economic inequality can be curbed by implementing socialism.  According to Paragraph 7, Wang An-shih's attempt to use socialism to address economic inequality ""met with only temporary success…as the system later fell to governmental corruption, private greed, and untimely droughts and floods.""  Thus, as Wang's socialist system was ultimately unsuccessful, the information about him is not mentioned as evidence for the idea that economic inequality can be curbed by implementing socialism.
(Choice D)  socialism was an infrequent phenomenon in post-industrial countries.  Paragraph 7 presents Wang An-shih as an example of ""various leaders throughout history"" who implemented socialism.  Thus, the passage suggests that socialism was relatively common, rather than an infrequent occurrence.  In addition, Wang is described as an ""eleventh-century Chinese statesman,"" indicating that he lived in a pre-industrial country."
"267","Based on the information in the passage, which of the following types of taxes would the author most likely view as beneficial to society?","A","48","As time passes, however, the wealth or destitution of one generation is bequeathed to the next, and then inequality becomes ingrained.  What was before an earned difference of outcome is now an unearned difference of potential.  One individual has an advantage that another lacks—not gained through striving and perseverance but inherited through accident of birth. (Paragraph 5)
Such effects only compound over time.  Inevitably, dynasties of wealth accrue by which a few through mere circumstance enjoy economic mastery over the many, who face through the tyranny of chance an undeserved impediment. (Paragraph 6)
In post-industrial America, governmental reforms and regulations on commerce and industry were required to redress the systemic injustices perpetuated by dynastic wealth, as well as to protect the welfare of a multitude bound to wages insufficient to secure life's necessities. (Paragraph 8)
The author argues that wealth redistribution is necessary as a response to economic inequality, especially as it concerns ""dynasties of wealth"" (Paragraph 6) that arise through inheritance.  According to Paragraph 5, ""the wealth or destitution of one generation is bequeathed to the next, and then inequality becomes ingrained.""  In the author's view, this ingrained inequality is unjust because the economic advantage that some people possess over others is simply ""inherited though accident of birth"" rather than ""gained through striving and perseverance.""  Thus, wealth redistribution is needed in order ""to redress (remedy) the systemic injustices perpetuated by dynastic wealth"" (Paragraph 8).
Accordingly, the tax system the author would most likely view as beneficial to society would be a progressive tax, where wealthier individuals are taxed at a higher rate than poorer individuals.  By requiring wealthier people to pay a relatively larger proportion of taxes, such a system would help to prevent the creation of dynastic wealth and its associated inequality.
 By contrast, the author would not most likely view the following kinds of taxes as beneficial to society:
a regressive tax, where the tax rate is eventually capped at a maximum level regardless of an individual's wealth (Choice B).  Under such a tax system, the richest individuals would pay proportionally less as their level of wealth rises, and as a result their descendants would inherit an even greater unearned economic advantage.  Accordingly, this kind of tax would contribute to the economic inequality and dynastic wealth that the author views as problematic.
a flat tax, where all individuals are taxed at the same rate regardless of their level of wealth (Choice C).  By taxing the poor at the same rate as the rich, this tax system would preserve the existing levels of economic advantage or disadvantage.
a consumption tax, where individuals' tax rates are based primarily on the value of goods and services that they purchase (Choice D).  Although wealthy individuals can afford to buy more expensive goods and services than poorer individuals, they can also choose whether or not to purchase such luxury items.  Hence, they could potentially reduce or eliminate the power of a consumption tax to affect them at a proportionally higher rate.  Accordingly, such a tax would be less effective at facilitating wealth redistribution than one that directly taxes wealthier individuals at a higher rate."
"268","Which of the following scenarios is the best example of a ""tyranny of chance"" (Paragraph 6), as the passage author uses the term?","B","48","Nonetheless, this claim of initial social equality is precisely what socialism rejects as illusory.  Let us suppose that everyone in society begins life upon equal footing....  Equality is shattered, but justly, and from an early uniformity of status rise differences in wealth, garnered according to the abilities and enterprise displayed by each person. (Paragraph 4)
As time passes, however, the wealth or destitution of one generation is bequeathed to the next, and then inequality becomes ingrained….  One individual has an advantage that another lacks—not gained through striving and perseverance but inherited through accident of birth. (Paragraph 5)
Such effects only compound over time.  Inevitably, dynasties of wealth accrue by which a few through mere circumstance enjoy economic mastery over the many, who face through the tyranny of chance an undeserved impediment. (Paragraph 6)
In Paragraph 4, the passage author implies that inequality can be just if it arises through fair competition, ""according to the abilities and enterprise displayed by each person.""  However, he or she stresses that such fair competition would depend on ""everyone in society begin[ning] life on equal footing,"" which is not the case.  Rather, much inequality simply arises by chance.
For example, the author stresses that when existing wealth or poverty is passed to the next generation, there inevitably arises a situation in which ""[o]ne individual has an advantage that another lacks—not gained through striving and perseverance but inherited through accident of birth"" (Paragraph 5).  Thus, the author states that ""through mere circumstance,"" there are disadvantaged individuals ""who face through the tyranny of chance an undeserved impediment"" (Paragraph 6).
Therefore, the author uses the term ""tyranny of chance"" to describe situations in which an individual is unfairly disadvantaged in society due to personal circumstances beyond his or her control (eg, being born into an impoverished family).  Accordingly, a job candidate who receives few employment offers because he is physically unattractive is the best example of a tyranny of chance.  Such a candidate does not deserve the disadvantage he suffers, because it is caused by a factor over which he had no control.
 By contrast, none of the following scenarios is the best example of a tyranny of chance:
A patient cannot have a desired medical procedure performed because her doctor has ethical concerns (Choice A).  A doctor's ethical concerns would most likely be based upon standards of practice that would be applied to any equivalent patient; they would not be a matter of chance or based on the woman's unique characteristics.
A defendant is found guilty at trial because his attorney could not persuade the jury that he is innocent (Choice C).  If the defendant were innocent but found guilty because his attorney could not persuade the jury, then the defendant could be considered as suffering an unfair disadvantage or ""tyranny of chance.""  However, if the defendant did commit the crime and was found guilty because his attorney could not persuade the jury, then it would be a deserved verdict, not a ""tyranny of chance.""  No information is given regarding whether the defendant actually committed the crime, so whether he faced a ""tyranny of chance"" cannot be determined.
A frequent gambler loses more than she wins because the games are engineered to have a higher likelihood of money loss (Choice D).  Although gambling involves games of chance, the likelihood of winning or losing would apply to any person who plays them (ie, the games are designed to make all players more likely to lose money).  Accordingly, while the frequent gambler loses more than she wins, she is not unfairly disadvantaged by her personal characteristics.  Therefore, this situation does not represent a tyranny of chance."
"269","The description of socialism as ""a pervasive bogeyman"" is part of the author's claim that:","B","48","For decades, socialism has been a pervasive bogeyman laying siege at the periphery of the American psyche.  Policies and candidates alike are dismissed out of hand by pronouncing them ""socialist,"" the term sufficing to preclude further consideration.  However, such reactions to any topic ought to give us pause: have we truly judged an idea as unworthy, impractical, or unjust?  Or do we simply demonstrate an unreflective fear of a label? (Paragraph 1)
In Paragraph 1, the author calls socialism ""a pervasive bogeyman laying siege at the periphery of the American psyche,"" thus portraying people as afraid of ideas thought to be socialist.  Moreover, the author asserts, this fear is so influential that the mere label 'socialist' is enough to make people reject those ideas prejudicially: ""Policies and candidates alike are dismissed out of hand by pronouncing them 'socialist,' the term sufficing to preclude (rule out) further consideration.""
Accordingly, the author implies that in dismissing socialist candidates and policies due to fear, people do not truly examine socialist ideas to evaluate them.  Therefore, the description of socialism as ""a pervasive bogeyman"" is part of the author's claim that people seldom genuinely examine socialist ideas.
 By contrast, the description of socialism as ""a pervasive bogeyman"" is not part of a claim that:
most Americans are unconcerned about socialist ideas (Choice A).  In Paragraph 1, the author describes American attitudes toward socialist ideas: ""Policies and candidates alike are dismissed out of hand by pronouncing them 'socialist,' the term sufficing to preclude further consideration.""  Accordingly, the author suggests that Americans are so concerned about socialist ideas that anything called 'socialist' is automatically rejected.
concerns about socialism are not reflected by the reality of socialism in practice (Choice C).  The author suggests that policies should not be ""dismissed out of hand"" due to fears about socialism (Paragraph 1).  However, this contention is part of a claim that socialist ideas should be genuinely evaluated; it is not based on assertions about the reality of socialism in practice.
objections to socialism are baseless (Choice D).  The author claims that ""legitimate scrutiny is warranted"" regarding socialism (Paragraph 2), implying that it is reasonable to look critically at socialist ideas.  Additionally, the author later suggests that ""a 'pure' form of either capitalism or socialism will ultimately prove destructive"" (Paragraph 8), implying that objections to socialism should be taken seriously."
"270","Based on the passage, a socialist would argue that those who object to wealth redistribution should actually support it because:","D","48","The objection to redistribution of wealth rests on the idea that it takes from the more deserving and gives to the less—if not to the lazy or the layabout.  Given equality of opportunity, why should he who toils be denied the right of harvest?  Why should he who idles be afforded an equal reward? (Paragraph 3)
As time passes, however, the wealth or destitution of one generation is bequeathed to the next, and then inequality becomes ingrained.  What was before an earned difference of outcome is now an unearned difference of potential…not gained through striving and perseverance but inherited through accident of birth. (Paragraph 5)
Such effects only compound over time.... The socialist's claim, then, is that complaints against redistribution of wealth fail in light of the very concern for fairness upon which they are founded. (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 3 poses the rhetorical questions: ""[W]hy should he who toils be denied the right of harvest?  Why should he who idles be afforded an equal reward?""  These objections to wealth redistribution (ie, transferring wealth from economically advantaged groups to economically disadvantaged groups) are based on a conception of economic fairness.  Specifically, the objectors believe economic inequality is fair as long as wealth goes to the people who have earned it and is not given to those who did not earn it themselves.
However, socialists point out that individuals who inherit wealth also did not earn it themselves.  When wealth is passed down it is ""not gained through striving and perseverance but inherited through accident of birth"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, socialists argue that ""complaints against redistribution of wealth fail in light of the very concern for fairness upon which they are founded"" (Paragraph 6).  In other words, if the inherited wealth is not redistributed, then wealth is given to those who did not earn it, violating the conception of fairness on which objections to wealth redistribution are based.
Accordingly, based on passage information, a socialist would argue that those who object to wealth redistribution should instead support it because the objectors' own commitment to fairness makes wealth redistribution justified.
 (Choice A)  wealth redistribution is consistent with capitalism.  Paragraph 8 describes capitalism as ""liable to exploitation,"" citing the example of ""the systemic injustices perpetuated by dynastic wealth.""  Hence, the passage indicates that capitalism leads to the kind of economic injustice that wealth redistribution is designed to alleviate.  Accordingly, the passage does not suggest that wealth redistribution is consistent with capitalism, but rather that wealth redistribution would help to correct a drawback of capitalism.
(Choice B)  people should not be denied the rewards of their labor.  According to Paragraph 3, ""capitalists and socialists will likely agree"" on the sentiments expressed by two rhetorical questions: ""[W]hy should he who toils be denied the right of harvest?  Why should he who idles be afforded an equal reward?""  However, the socialist's argument for wealth redistribution is based on the second of these points (ie, that people should not receive unearned rewards) rather than the first (ie, that people should not be denied the rewards of their labor).
(Choice C)  the majority of people have benefited from past socialistic reforms.  Paragraph 8 states that ""[i]n post-industrial America, governmental reforms and regulations on commerce and industry were required to redress (remedy) the systemic injustices perpetuated by dynastic wealth.""  A socialist would likely agree that people have benefited from such reforms.  However, the argument that those who object to wealth redistribution should instead support it is based not on the effect of past reforms, but instead on the objectors' own values.  Specifically, a socialist would argue that concern for economic fairness justifies wealth redistribution, regardless of whether the objectors agree that past socialistic reforms were beneficial."
"271","Which of the following statements regarding the author's argument would represent the most reasonable criticism?","D","48","In fact, capitalists and socialists will likely agree on the broad outlines of what fairness entails.  The objection to redistribution of wealth rests on the idea that it takes from the more deserving and gives to the less—if not to the lazy or the layabout.  Given equality of opportunity, why should he who toils be denied the right of harvest?  Why should he who idles be afforded an equal reward? (Paragraph 3)
As time passes, however, the wealth or destitution of one generation is bequeathed to the next, and then inequality becomes ingrained.  What was before an earned difference of outcome is now an unearned difference of potential. (Paragraph 5)
Such effects only compound over time...The socialist's claim, then, is that complaints against redistribution of wealth fail in light of the very concern for fairness upon which they are founded. (Paragraph 6)
A key part of the author's argument involves the relationship between wealth redistribution and economic fairness.  Although socialists generally support wealth redistribution while capitalists oppose it, the author asserts that both groups ""will likely agree on the broad outlines of what fairness entails.""  Specifically, capitalists and socialists both believe economic fairness means that wealth should go to those who earn it.  Thus, ""he who toils"" has a right to economic reward, but ""he who idles"" does not (Paragraph 3).
Nevertheless, the author argues that this connection between toil and reward inevitably breaks down.  When wealth or poverty is passed to the next generation, ""[w]hat was before an earned difference of outcome is now an unearned difference of potential"" (Paragraph 5).  In other words, although the person who works has originally earned wealth, someone who only inherits that same wealth has not earned it.  Therefore, the author argues that ""complaints against redistribution of wealth fail"" (Paragraph 6).  Rather, wealth redistribution is justified to help restore the ""equality of opportunity"" (Paragraph 3) needed to connect economic rewards with a person's own efforts in acquiring them.
However, the author never provides any details about the way this redistribution should function.  Accordingly, even if one accepts the author's conclusion that wealth redistribution is necessary for economic fairness, it may be unclear what form that redistribution could take, whether certain proposals would be effective, and so on.  Hence, lacking these details could call into question whether the proposed wealth redistribution is actually feasible.  Therefore, the most reasonable criticism of the author's argument would be that the passage does not discuss how wealth redistribution should be achieved.
 (Choice A)  Some Americans are already receptive to socialist ideas.  Paragraph 1 states that in America, ""[p]olicies and candidates alike are dismissed out of hand by pronouncing them 'socialist.'""  However, this attitude could be typical or widespread without applying to every American.  Accordingly, even if some Americans are already receptive to socialist ideas, that fact would not challenge the author's argument that Americans in general should be more willing to consider such ideas.
(Choice B)  Historically, proposals to redistribute wealth have always faced resistance.  Part of the passage argument concerns addressing ""[t]he objection to redistribution of wealth"" (Paragraph 3) and explaining why, in the author's view, that objection fails.  Therefore, the idea that wealth redistribution faces resistance would not be a criticism of the author's argument, but one of its motivations.
(Choice C)  Every economic system has some benefits and some flaws.  In Paragraph 8, the author suggests that ""a 'pure' form of either capitalism or socialism will ultimately prove destructive.""  Thus, he or she argues that instead of following any one economic system exclusively, we should ""instead inquire which ideas, and in what combination, best promote the justice whose value we profess.""  Therefore, the idea that every economic system has benefits and flaws is something the author seems to acknowledge; hence, that idea would not serve as a criticism of the author's argument."
"272","The author suggests that the majority of people in America are opposed to socialism mainly due to:","C","48","Policies and candidates alike are dismissed out of hand by pronouncing them ""socialist,"" the term sufficing to preclude further consideration.  However, such reactions to any topic ought to give us pause: have we truly judged an idea as unworthy, impractical, or unjust?  Or do we simply demonstrate an unreflective fear of a label? (Paragraph 1)
Are the dismissive reactions towards socialism then justified?  Not as such…. Rather than embrace or reject one system from the outset, we must avoid a focus on labels and instead inquire which ideas, and in what combination, best promote the justice whose value we profess. (Paragraph 8)
According to Paragraph 1, people in America tend to just assume socialism is detrimental and therefore reject it unthinkingly: ""[p]olicies and candidates alike are dismissed out of hand by pronouncing them 'socialist,' the term sufficing to preclude further consideration.""  Thus, in the author's view, most Americans do not truly examine the ideas behind socialism, but instead ""simply demonstrate an unreflective fear of a label"" (Paragraph 1).
Likewise, the author further alludes to this idea in Paragraph 8, asserting that ""we must avoid a focus on labels and instead inquire which ideas, and in what combination, best promote the justice whose value we profess.""  In this way, the author again implies that Americans reject ideas called 'socialist' without considering those ideas for themselves.  Therefore, the author suggests that the majority of people in America are opposed to socialism mainly due to a pre-existing bias against it.
 (Choice A)  uneasiness over government influence.  Paragraph 7 mentions a historical case in which socialism was implemented, when ""eleventh-century Chinese statesman Wang An-shih instituted state control of the economy.""  However, although this information connects socialism to government influence, the author never suggests that uneasiness over such influence is the main reason many Americans oppose socialism.
(Choice B)  confusion about what policies it entails.  Paragraph 2 states that ""[p]erhaps the gravest threat of socialist programmes to capitalist America is their perceived unfairness"" in transferring wealth from certain groups to others.  Thus, the passage conveys that people have some awareness of socialist ideas and the ""threat"" they represent.  Therefore, the author does not suggest that many Americans reject socialism due to confusion over what policies it entails, but rather that they reject it because they have a negative view of those policies.
(Choice D)  a scrutiny of its ideas.  In Paragraph 1, the author states that ""[p]olicies and candidates alike are dismissed out of hand by pronouncing them 'socialist,' the term sufficing to preclude further consideration.""  He or she then goes on to say: ""Initial prejudice notwithstanding, legitimate scrutiny is warranted"" (Paragraph 2).  Therefore, the author indicates that there are reasons to scrutinize socialism, but suggests that most people do not actually engage in such scrutiny; rather, they reject socialism due to their prejudice against it."
"273","The passage author's attitude toward the bewildered concert-goer is:","C","49","To the untutored layman, an orchestra's or choir's conductor may seem a superfluous appendage (although the view is unlikely to be expressed in such lofty terms).  Indeed, this sentiment is aptly conveyed by one bewildered concert-goer, who asked his companion: ""They know the song, and the music's right there in front of them.  So what do they need the guy with the wand for?""  This flagrant ignorance aside, it is true that the purpose of a conductor (and his baton) is but little understood by those who only listen to music rather than produce it.  Yet conductors play a pivotal role in these productions, elevating a performance beyond what it would be as merely a group of musicians engaged in a common cause. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 describes a ""bewildered concert-goer"" who did not understand why the musicians had a conductor: ""'They know the song, and the music's right there in front of them.  So what do they need the guy with the wand for?'""  The passage author calls this question an example of ""flagrant ignorance"" (ie, ignorance that is especially extreme and blameworthy), suggesting that he or she looks down upon the concert-goer for asking it.
The author further displays this disdainful attitude through remarks about language use, which imply that the concert-goer lacks intelligence and sophistication.  For instance, the author asserts that confusion about conductors ""is unlikely to be expressed in such lofty terms"" as ""superfluous appendage"" (ie, an unnecessary or pointless addition) and emphasizes that conductors use a ""baton"" rather than a ""'wand.'""
Consequently, the passage author belittles and ridicules the bewildered concert-goer, exhibiting an attitude of open condescension.
 (Choices A and B)  thorough puzzlement; and shocked incredulity.  Paragraph 1 describes the concert-goer as displaying ""flagrant ignorance"" about the purpose of conductors.  However, the author then suggests that similar types of ignorance are relatively common, stating: ""it is true that the purpose of a conductor (and his baton) is but little understood by those who only listen to music rather than produce it.""  Accordingly, the author does not express confusion or disbelief about the concert-goer.  Rather, he or she treats the concert-goer's reaction as an especially pronounced example of how ""[t]o the untutored layman, an orchestra's or choir's conductor may seem a superfluous appendage.""
(Choice D)  delighted amusement.  Paragraph 1 describes the concert-goer's question about conductors as a case of ""flagrant ignorance.""  This highly negative portrayal would suggest that the author views the concert-goer as obnoxious and dull; he or she never suggests that the concert-goer's ignorance is delightful or amusing."
"274","Based on information in the passage, a crucial difference between the role of a sports coach in a game and the role of a conductor in a concert is that:","C","49","Such factors explain why the comparison of a conductor to a sports coach would represent an inadequate understanding.  For while a coach instructs the players, determining their course and addressing their deficiencies, he does not take the field or court along with them.  However much he guides them, when the whistle blows, it is they who partake in the actual striving. (Paragraph 4)
A more apt analogy is provided by Paul Engelstad: ""At the conclusion of a fine concert, the conductor shares the applause and is quick to give credit to his choir.  But when the ship flounders and is lost, the responsible captain accepts all blame and absolves his crew from any fault.""  The conductor is as much a performer as the singer or instrumentalist under his command; together they voyage successfully or sink. (Paragraph 5)
According to the passage, conductors and sports coaches differ in terms of how they influence a concert or game.  Although a coach gives instructions to the athletes, ""he does not take the field or court along with them.  However much he guides them, when the whistle blows, it is they who partake in the actual striving"" (Paragraph 4).  Thus, although coaches affect the outcome of a game by training and instructing the players, they do not play in the game themselves.
By contrast, the act of conducting is itself a part of the concert.  By directing the musicians, a conductor ""is as much a performer as the singer or instrumentalist under his command; together they voyage successfully or sink"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, the passage implies that a crucial difference between the role of a sports coach in a game and the role of a conductor in a concert is that conductors perform alongside the musicians.
 (Choices A and B)  conductors give the credit for successes to the performers; and conductors shoulder the blame for every failure.  In Paragraph 5, the author cites Paul Engelstad's position that conductors should attribute successes to their performers, but take the blame for any failures themselves: ""'At the conclusion of a fine concert, the conductor shares the applause and is quick to give credit to his choir.  But when the ship flounders and is lost, the responsible captain accepts all blame and absolves his crew from any fault.'""
However, although the author draws a contrast between conductors and sports coaches, this distinction is not based on how they assign credit or blame, but rather on whether they ""partake in the actual striving"" alongside their players (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, it would be consistent with passage information if both conductors and coaches take the blame for any failures but give their players credit for successes.
(Choice D)  conductors communicate instructions non-verbally.  According to Paragraph 4, conductors use physical cues to influence performers.  For instance, ""[t]iming, volume, and emotional expressiveness can all be communicated non-verbally.""  However, the passage never discusses whether coaches might similarly communicate with players non-verbally.  Therefore, the passage does not distinguish between conductors and sports coaches in terms of giving non-verbal instructions."
"275","Which of the following statements about conductors and singers is most strongly suggested by Paragraph 3?","A","49","Nor is it purely a figure of speech that one can see a musical piece's character in the conductor.  Timing, volume, and emotional expressiveness can all be communicated non-verbally; not only through overt gestures but kinesthetically, via the operation of mirror neurons.  As Riikka Pietiläinen-Caffrey notes, ""Studies of the mirror neuron system are helpful for explaining scientifically what conductors already know by experience.""  Singers subconsciously mimic physical cues from a conductor, affecting their ""tone of voice, pronunciation, gesture, body posture, and breathing rates.""  Through even small adjustments to his or her own body, a conductor may therefore correct—or exacerbate—issues with singers' vocal quality, stance, proper inhalation, and so on, both during rehearsals and, more crucially, in concerts. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, singers ""can see a musical piece's character in the conductor.  Timing, volume, and emotional expressiveness can all be communicated non-verbally.""  The author then describes the effects of this non-verbal communication, asserting that ""[s]ingers subconsciously mimic physical cues from a conductor, affecting their 'tone of voice, pronunciation, gesture, body posture, and breathing rates.'""
Thus, Paragraph 3 indicates that conductors influence many aspects of singers' performance, and that some parts of this process may occur subconsciously.  Therefore, conductors may influence the performance of singers in ways that the singers are not directly aware of.
 (Choice B)  Conductors typically do not provide verbal instructions to singers during rehearsals.  Paragraph 3 states that ""[t]iming, volume, and emotional expressiveness can all be communicated nonverbally,"" and that ""[s]ingers subconsciously mimic physical cues from a conductor.""  However, although conductors can communicate using non-verbal cues, this does not exclude the possibility that they also provide verbal instructions to singers during rehearsals.  For instance, a conductor might verbally instruct singers before they begin singing, but use non-verbal cues while the singing is taking place.
(Choice C)  Difficulties experienced by singers are caused by conductors giving inaccurate physical cues.  According to Paragraph 3, ""Through even small adjustments to his or her own body, a conductor may therefore correct—or exacerbate (make worse)—issues with singers' vocal quality, stance, proper inhalation, and so on.""  However, although the conductor may correct or exacerbate singers' issues, the passage never suggests that he or she was the cause of those issues.  Rather, it simply states that the influence of a conductor can affect whether singers improve or grow worse in those areas.
(Choice D)  Conductors who possess an understanding of mirror neurons influence singers more effectively.  Paragraph 3 cites Riikka Pietiläinen-Caffrey's assertion that ""'[s]tudies of the mirror neuron system are helpful for explaining scientifically what conductors already know by experience.'""  Accordingly, this statement does not suggest that conductors influence singers more effectively when they understand mirror neurons.  Rather, it suggests that conductors ""already know by experience"" how to influence singers, and the mirror neuron system helps to explain why their techniques are effective."
"276","Which of the following discoveries would most undermine the author's claims about the role of conductors?","B","49","To the untutored layman, an orchestra's or choir's conductor may seem a superfluous appendage….  This flagrant ignorance aside, it is true that the purpose of a conductor (and his baton) is but little understood by those who only listen to music rather than produce it.  Yet conductors play a pivotal role in these productions, elevating a performance beyond what it would be as merely a group of musicians engaged in a common cause. (Paragraph 1)
In essence, the conductor is a unifying force, effecting a full transformation of complementary musical parts into a singular yet multifaceted whole. (Paragraph 2)
The conductor as captain thus gives the music its ultimate sense and expression.  The musical score has its instructions, but it is the conductor's interpretive vision that determines how the notes should be played or sung.  In short, the conductor infuses a work with passion, that element which, in the words of Terry York, ""modulates the performance to something greater than the sum of its parts."" (Paragraph 6)
Throughout the passage, the author stresses the importance of conductors in raising musical performances to greater heights.  For instance, Paragraph 1 states that ""conductors play a pivotal role…elevating a performance beyond what it would be as merely a group of musicians engaged in a common cause.""  Similarly, Paragraph 2 asserts that ""the conductor is a unifying force, effecting a full transformation of complementary musical parts into a singular yet multifaceted whole.""  Finally, the author concludes by stating that ""the conductor infuses a work with passion, that element which…'modulates the performance to something greater than the sum of its parts'"" (Paragraph 6).
Thus, the author asserts that conductors improve musical performances, enabling them to reach a level of excellence beyond what the musicians would achieve on their own.  However, if there were little difference in quality between performances that included conductors and those that did not, this would suggest that a conductor's efforts actually do not have much impact.  In that case, conductors would indeed be ""a superfluous appendage"" (Paragraph 1) rather than a transformative and elevating force.  Consequently, the author's claims about the role of conductors would be most undermined if symphonies receive similar acclaim from professional music critics whether or not the orchestras were led by a conductor.
 (Choice A)  When a conductor is not present, professional musicians still play their instruments with a high level of proficiency.  According to Paragraph 1, conductors ""elevat[e] a performance beyond what it would be as merely a group of musicians engaged in a common cause.""  However, this claim does not mean that musicians lack proficiency at playing their instruments when a conductor is not present.  Rather, the musicians may be highly skilled in either case, yet they could still have their performance as a group made ""'greater than the sum of its parts'"" by a conductor (Paragraph 6).
(Choice C)  Research studies suggest that the effects of conducting have little to do with the mirror neuron system.  According to Paragraph 3, ""Timing, volume, and emotional expressiveness can all be communicated non-verbally; not only through overt gestures but kinesthetically, via the operation of mirror neurons.""  However, if it were discovered that the effects of conducting have little to do with the mirror neuron system, that would challenge only the explanation of why conductors' techniques are effective.  It would not challenge the effectiveness of the techniques themselves.
(Choice D)  A survey of non-musicians finds that a majority of people believe conductors are important to the coherence and overall quality of a concert.  In this scenario, the author would be wrong that ""the purpose of a conductor…is but little understood by those who only listen to music rather than produce it"" (Paragraph 1).  Instead, most non-musicians would understand the purpose of conductors.  However, this discovery would undermine only the author's claims about how non-musicians conceive of conductors; it would not undermine his or her claims about the role of conductors."
"277","Which of the following ideas is the author inconsistent about in the passage?","A","49","In essence, the conductor is a unifying force, effecting a full transformation of complementary musical parts into a singular yet multifaceted whole.  A composer's vision is thereby transmitted through the musicians to be delivered to the audience—by the hand of the conductor, the truth of the music is made manifest. (Paragraph 2)
The conductor as captain thus gives the music its ultimate sense and expression.  The musical score has its instructions, but it is the conductor's interpretive vision that determines how the notes should be played or sung.  In short, the conductor infuses a work with passion, that element which, in the words of Terry York, ""modulates the performance to something greater than the sum of its parts."" (Paragraph 6)
When describing conducting in Paragraph 2, the author states: ""A composer's vision is thereby transmitted through the musicians to be delivered to the audience—by the hand of the conductor, the truth of the music is made manifest.""  Accordingly, in this part of the passage, the author implies that conductors transmit a composer's vision, which is identified as ""the truth of the music.""
However, Paragraph 6 asserts that ""[t]he conductor as captain thus gives the music its ultimate sense and expression.  The musical score has its instructions, but it is the conductor's interpretive vision that determines how the notes should be played or sung.""  Thus, in this later part of the passage, the author implies that a conductor may use his or her own ""interpretive vision"" for the music despite the composer's instructions in the musical score.
Consequently, the author is inconsistent about whether conductors convey their own vision for a piece of music or the vision of the composer.
 By contrast, the author is not inconsistent about any of the following ideas in the passage:
Whether the role of conductors is generally understood or misunderstood (Choice B).  In Paragraph 1, the author asserts that ""the purpose of a conductor…is but little understood by those who only listen to music rather than produce it.""  Hence, the author suggests that the role of conductors is generally misunderstood; he or she never contradicts this claim elsewhere in the passage.
Whether conductors and coaches are entirely dissimilar or only somewhat different (Choice C).  The author conveys that conductors and coaches are similar in that both help to improve the performance of those they lead.  For example, conductors ""correct…issues with singers' vocal quality, stance, proper inhalation, and so on"" (Paragraph 3), and ""a coach instructs the players…addressing their deficiencies"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, although the author asserts that ""the comparison of a conductor to a sports coach would represent an inadequate understanding"" (Paragraph 4), he or she never suggests that the two roles are entirely dissimilar.
Whether the information about conductors applies more to conducting orchestras or choirs (Choice D).  The author refers to conducting both choirs and orchestras, but never draws a distinction between the two types of conducting.  For example, Paragraph 5 states that ""[t]he conductor is as much a performer as the singer or instrumentalist under his command,"" and Paragraph 6 refers to determining ""how the notes should be played or sung.""  Thus, the author implies that his or her remarks apply to both choirs and orchestras; he or she never suggests otherwise in the passage."
"278","Passage information suggests that Beethoven's symphony and Klimt's frieze were notable in part because they:","C","50","In Swafford's astute estimation, the Ninth embodies Beethoven's own quest for the perfect melody; it is about ""the composer composing."" (Paragraph 2)
Klimt further immortalized the tune with his monumental frieze spanning three sides of the room it occupies.  This ""Ode to Joy"" mural depicts humanity's desperate struggle to achieve happiness through the power of art.  In the process, the painter reveals his own tortured search for the perfect style.  As a result, the finished frieze reflects a syncretism of ancient Greek, Byzantine, early medieval, Japanese, and contemporary Viennese art, yet also gleams with the unique gold inlay that would characterize Klimt's work. (Paragraph 3)
The passage stresses that both Beethoven and Klimt allowed the evidence of their own artistic struggles to show through their finished works.  For instance, Paragraph 2 presents Jan Swafford's view that ""the Ninth embodies Beethoven's own quest for the perfect melody; it is about 'the composer composing.'""  In other words, the Ninth presents the composer's artistic process and efforts.  Similarly, Paragraph 3 conveys that Klimt revealed ""his own tortured search for the perfect style"" through his painting.  As a result of this search, ""the finished frieze reflects a syncretism (mixture) of ancient Greek, Byzantine, early medieval, Japanese, and contemporary Viennese art, yet also gleams with the unique gold inlay that came to characterize Klimt's work.""
Consequently, passage information suggests that Beethoven's symphony and Klimt's frieze were notable in part because they revealed the process and great effort entailed in art.
 (Choice A)  stressed the frailties over the triumph of the human spirit.  Both Beethoven's symphony and Klimt's frieze emphasized the resiliency of the human spirit.  As the author points out, Beethoven's Ninth has ""served as protest song, hymn to freedom, and unifying chant"" and has been ""regularly hailed as 'a universal human anthem' and 'the battle cry of humanity'"" (Paragraph 2).  Likewise, Klimt's frieze describes how, with the help of the arts, the human spirit is strong enough to overcome the trials of existence: ""the magnificent image of a solitary muse…attests that the human quest for happiness will find its ultimate fulfillment in art"" (Paragraph 6).  Therefore, rather than merely stressing the frailties of the human spirit, both Beethoven's symphony and Klimt's frieze emphasized that the human spirit is ultimately triumphant.
(Choice B)  incorporated instructive messages to other artists.  The passage conveys that both Beethoven's Ninth and Klimt's frieze illustrate the struggles of artistic creation.  Paragraph 2 cites Jan Swafford's view that the Ninth ""embodies Beethoven's own quest for the perfect melody"" and reflects ""'the composer composing.'""  Paragraph 3 then conveys that the frieze reveals Klimt's ""own tortured search for the perfect style.""  Although other artists could likely relate to these struggles, the passage never indicates that either work contained instructive messages directed toward other artists.
(Choice D)  portrayed each person's journey toward happiness as unique.  As Paragraph 2 notes, the finale to Beethoven's Ninth is ""regularly hailed as 'a universal human anthem' and 'the battle cry of humanity.'""  Thus, the symphony represents humanity as striving toward a shared freedom and happiness.  Likewise, in Klimt's frieze, humanity is engaged in a struggle to overcome ""the hostile forces…that obstruct human happiness"" (Paragraph 5).  In the final panel, ""the magnificent image of a solitary muse…attests that the human quest for happiness will find its ultimate fulfillment in art"" (Paragraph 6).  Accordingly, the passage suggests that both Beethoven's symphony and Klimt's frieze presented a collective journey toward happiness—one that belongs to all humanity rather than one that was uniquely personal."
"279","Which of the following claims is strongly supported by passage evidence?","A","50","This ""Ode to Joy"" mural depicts humanity's desperate struggle to achieve happiness through the power of art.  In the process, the painter reveals his own tortured search for the perfect style.  As a result, the finished frieze reflects a syncretism of ancient Greek, Byzantine, early medieval, Japanese, and contemporary Viennese art, yet also gleams with the unique gold inlay that would characterize Klimt's work. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, Klimt's Beethoven Frieze ""reveals his own tortured search for the perfect style.""  The author then describes how ""the finished frieze reflects a syncretism (mixture) of ancient Greek, Byzantine, early medieval, Japanese, and contemporary Viennese art, yet also gleams with the unique gold inlay that came to characterize Klimt's work.""  Hence, the passage describes how when painting the frieze, Klimt integrated artistic styles from various sources, which he then overlayed with an innovation of his own.  Accordingly, the claim that Klimt's artistic technique reflected multiple sources is strongly supported by passage evidence.
 By contrast, passage evidence does not support the following claims:
Klimt was conscious of the prestige involved in creating the frieze (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 1, Klimt's ""spectacular wall painting was commissioned as a part of the fourteenth exhibition of the Viennese Secession"" and was ""[u]nveiled as an homage (public honoring) to the great composer.""  The author further conveys that ""the exhibit was meant to be temporary"" but Klimt's frieze ""was restored and became an enduring masterpiece.""  Although this information suggests that Klimt's frieze was considered important to the exhibit and was later held in high regard, the passage never reveals how Klimt felt about painting the frieze or whether he was aware of any prestige being involved.
Klimt's work was influential while that of his contemporaries was not (Choice C).  Paragraph 1 stresses that ""in the case of Klimt's frieze, what began as an ad hoc (ie, set up for a particular purpose) display, painted directly on brittle plaster, was restored and became an enduring masterpiece.""  The fact that the mural was deliberately restored and has since been proclaimed a masterpiece demonstrates that the frieze was influential.  However, the passage never discusses the other Secessionist painters' work and whether it was influential.
Many Secessionists were much more conventional than Klimt (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 1, the Viennese Secession was ""an association of radically nontraditional artists founded in 1897 and headed by Klimt.""  Hence, these artists could be characterized as highly unconventional.  However, the passage never discusses whether other Secessionist artists were any more or less conventional than Klimt."
"280","The passage most strongly suggests which of the following about choral pieces?","B","50","With his Ninth Symphony, first performed in 1824, Beethoven revolutionized the symphonic genre; in particular, the final movement was the first such work to feature a chorus. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, ""With his Ninth Symphony, first performed in 1824, Beethoven revolutionized the symphonic genre.""  Likely his most radical innovation was the symphony's final movement, which became ""the first such work to feature a chorus.""  This fact implies that in succeeding years other composers would also feature choruses in their symphonies.  Consequently, the passage most strongly suggests that choral pieces are more prevalent in symphonies after Beethoven's time.
 By contrast, although the following statements may describe Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy,"" the passage never suggests that they are characteristic of choral pieces:
Choral pieces are composed by musicians rebelling against convention (Choice A).  Paragraph 2 states that ""Beethoven revolutionized the symphonic genre"" with the choral movement of his Ninth Symphony.  However, the passage never generalizes from Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"" to convey the idea that choral pieces are more likely to be composed by musicians who rebel against convention.
Choral pieces are derived from common tunes that anyone could sing (Choice C).  Paragraph 2 conveys Jan Swafford's words about the Ninth Symphony's choral piece: ""[Beethoven] 'erected a movement of epic scope on a humble little tune that anyone can sing.'""  However, the humble origin of the ""Ode to Joy"" is presented as ironic or surprising rather than as something typical of choral pieces.
Choral pieces readily lend themselves to visual representation (Choice D).  Although the painter Klimt chose to depict the choral piece or ""Ode to Joy"" of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on his frieze, the passage never connects this fact to the idea that choral pieces readily lend themselves to visual representation."
"281","Based on the passage, many of the figures in Klimt's frieze are meant to be interpreted as:","A","50","First, sylph-like female figures—genii signifying the human yearning for happiness—float past.  Next, naked, pitiable figures, including the emaciated form of a girl and a kneeling couple, epitomize humanity's suffering.  They implore a knight in shining golden armor, behind whom looms the feminine dyad of Compassion and Ambition, to protect humankind. (Paragraph 4)
The middle wall portrays the hostile forces—external as well as internal—that obstruct human happiness.  The giant gorilla-like monster Typhoeus, whose lower body morphs into that of a winding serpent, symbolizes not only the typhoid disease that ravaged Europe but also the destructive winds of war.  To the left stand his three, snake-haired, Gorgon-like daughters, above whom peer the grimacing faces of Sickness, Madness, and Death—scourges prevalent in the Viennese society of Klimt's day.  To the monster's right, the threefold evils of Lasciviousness, Wantonness, and Intemperance lurk, while dwarfed before his serpentine coil appears the horrifying hag of Gnawing Grief. (Paragraph 5)
On the far wall, the ephemeral feminine genii of human desires once again float past.  In the following panel, a vertical arrangement of five females appearing to awaken represents the different art forms.  Farther to the right, the magnificent image of a solitary muse holding a golden lyre attests that the human quest for happiness will find its ultimate fulfillment in art. (Paragraph 6)
The passage presents many of the figures in Klimt's frieze as symbolic.  For example, Paragraph 4 describes the ""sylph-like (slender and graceful) female figures—genii signifying the human yearning for happiness"" and the ""naked, pitiable figures, including the emaciated form of a girl and a kneeling couple [who] epitomize (represent) humanity's suffering.""  In addition, the ""feminine dyad (pair) of Compassion and Ambition"" is mentioned.  While these figures have human form, they represent concepts or abstract ideas such as happiness and suffering.
Likewise, Paragraph 5 showcases ""hostile forces"" that, though abstract, have living forms such as the ""giant gorilla-like monster Typhoeus,"" who ""symbolizes…the destructive winds of war,"" as well as ""Sickness, Madness, and Death,"" which are portrayed as ""grimacing faces.""  Others, including ""the threefold evils of Lasciviousness, Wantonness, and Intemperance"" and ""the horrifying hag of Gnawing Grief,"" are also mentioned.
Paragraph 6 presents more symbolic figures: ""[A] vertical arrangement of five females…represents the different art forms.""  Farther on, ""a solitary muse holding a golden lyre attests that the human quest for happiness will find its ultimate fulfillment in art.""
Although the figures mentioned above have the forms of humans or other living beings, they stand for abstract concepts, such as compassion, war, and grief.  Therefore, based on the passage, many of the figures in Klimt's frieze are meant to be interpreted as personified concepts.
 (Choice B)  muses.  According to Paragraph 6, ""[T]he magnificent image of a solitary muse…attests that the human quest for happiness will find its ultimate fulfillment in art.""  However, this muse is only one of the figures in the frieze; the passage never indicates that any of the other figures are meant to be muses.
(Choice C)  dream images.  In describing the frieze, Paragraph 4 mentions ""sylph-like female figures—genii signifying the human yearning for happiness,"" while Paragraph 6 conveys that ""the ephemeral (transient) feminine genii of human desires once again float past.""  Even though these figures might appear dream-like, the passage never suggests that they are meant to represent images from a dream.
(Choice D)  lovers.  In Paragraph 4, the author mentions ""a kneeling couple"" who are supposed to ""epitomize humanity's suffering"" but are not depicted as lovers.  By contrast, Paragraph 6 describes the final panel of the frieze, where ""locked in an embrace, a man and woman kiss.""  While the kissing couple represent lovers, most of the images on the frieze are solitary figures—for example Typhoid, the Horrifying Hag, and the muse—or feminine groups of two, three, or five.  Accordingly, while some of the figures on the frieze may be lovers, many are not."
"282","Of the following assertions about painters, which is most strongly suggested by information in Paragraph 3?","B","50","Klimt further immortalized the tune with his monumental frieze spanning three sides of the room it occupies.  This ""Ode to Joy"" mural depicts humanity's desperate struggle to achieve happiness through the power of art.  In the process, the painter reveals his own tortured search for the perfect style.  As a result, the finished frieze reflects a syncretism of ancient Greek, Byzantine, early medieval, Japanese, and contemporary Viennese art, yet also gleams with the unique gold inlay that would characterize Klimt's work. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, in painting his ""Ode to Joy"" mural, Klimt ""reveals his own tortured search for the perfect style.""  Hence, his ""finished frieze reflects a syncretism (mixture) of ancient Greek, Byzantine, early medieval, Japanese, and contemporary Viennese art, yet also gleams with the unique gold inlay that came to characterize Klimt's work.""  Accordingly, the passage implies that Klimt's desire to find the perfect style prompted him to borrow from multiple artistic influences while incorporating his own unique stylistic flourish.  Therefore, the information in Paragraph 3 suggests that painters who are in search of a new style are more likely to be eclectic.
 By contrast, none of the following assertions is strongly suggested by the information in Paragraph 3:
Painters prior to Klimt rarely revealed the struggles required to produce their artistic works (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 3, in the process of painting his ""Ode to Joy"" mural, Klimt ""reveals his own tortured search for the perfect style.""  However, the passage never indicates whether any of the artists who preceded Klimt ever revealed the struggles of their artistic process in their works.
The works of successful painters include a distinctive identifying feature (Choice C).  Paragraph 3 points out that the Beethoven Frieze ""gleams with the unique gold inlay that came to characterize Klimt's work.""  However, although the passage mentions this unique feature of the work of Klimt, who was an innovative and successful painter of the Viennese Secession, it never comments on whether the works of other successful painters include a similarly distinctive identifying feature.
The most impressive paintings are those in which the painters borrow from other art forms (Choice D).  Paragraph 1 describes Klimt's frieze as ""offer[ing] a visual representation of the finale to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.""  Accordingly, Klimt borrowed from another art form, namely music.  However, despite Klimt's example, the passage never generalizes to suggest that the most impressive paintings are those in which the painters borrow from other art forms.  Moreover, Paragraph 3 does not discuss painters borrowing from other art forms but focuses on the eclectic nature of Klimt's work."
"283","The passage indicates that the lyrics to ""Ode to Joy"" derived from:","D","50","With his Ninth Symphony, first performed in 1824, Beethoven revolutionized the symphonic genre; in particular, the final movement was the first such work to feature a chorus.  Ironically, the prima materia of that sublime finale was a drinking song, called ""Ode to Joy,"" written by the German Romantic poet Friedrich Schiller.  As biographer Jan Swafford sums up, Beethoven ""erected a movement of epic scope on a humble little tune that anyone can sing."" (Paragraph 2)
In describing Beethoven's Ninth, the author notes that ""the prima materia (base substance) of that sublime finale was a drinking song, called 'Ode to Joy'"" (Paragraph 2).  This song was written by Friedrich Schiller, who was a German Romantic poet.  Accordingly, the passage indicates that the lyrics to ""Ode to Joy"" derived from a poet's work.
 (Choice A)  Beethoven's vision of the fitting words for the perfect melody.  Paragraph 2 presents Jan Swafford's view that ""the Ninth embodies Beethoven's own quest for the perfect melody; it is about 'the composer composing.'""  However, although Beethoven was searching for the perfect melody, the passage never indicates that he was searching for the perfect words or lyrics to accompany that melody.  In fact, Paragraph 2 reveals that what became the finale to the Ninth ""was a drinking song, called 'Ode to Joy,'"" the lyrics to which were ""written by the German Romantic poet Friedrich Schiller.""
(Choices B and C)  folk tunes created and sung in German taverns; and an anonymous drinking song.  As Paragraph 2 points out, ""[T]he prima materia of that sublime finale"" that ended Beethoven's Ninth ""was a drinking song, called 'Ode to Joy,' written by the German Romantic poet Friedrich Schiller.""  As such, ""Ode to Joy"" might possibly have been sung in German taverns; however, the passage never suggests that it derived from folk tunes created in such taverns but instead stresses that it was written by Schiller.  Likewise, it was not an anonymous drinking song but one with a known author."
"284","The description of Putnam's thought experiments would suggest which of the following about Twin Earth?","B","51","In the experiment's original formulation, Putnam asks the reader to imagine Earth centuries in the past, along with a nearly identical Twin Earth. (Paragraph 1)
In this version of Twin Earth, the metal molybdenum is used instead of aluminum for pots and pans, and ordinary people cannot tell the difference between them. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 1, the Twin Earth thought experiment ""asks the reader to imagine Earth…along with a nearly identical Twin Earth.""  In one version of that thought experiment, Twin Earth differs from Earth because ""the metal molybdenum is used instead of aluminum for pots and pans, and ordinary people cannot tell the difference between them"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, all the pots and pans that would be made of aluminum on Earth are made of molybdenum on Twin Earth.  Consequently, the description of Putnam's thought experiments would suggest that on Twin Earth, molybdenum would be as common as aluminum is on Earth.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 2 states that ""the intension of the term 'water' would be the same on Earth and Twin Earth.  People on both worlds would possess the same concept of that term and embody the same mental states while using it.""  Therefore, lakes and oceans would be conceived of in the same way on both Earth and Twin Earth, even though 'water' would refer to H2O in one case and XYZ in the other.
(Choice C)  According to Paragraph 4, Putnam specifies that ""'the words 'aluminum' and 'molybdenum' are switched on Twin Earth: 'aluminum' is the name of molybdenum, and 'molybdenum' is the name of aluminum.'""  However, the fact that the names are ""switched"" in relation to Earth does not mean that people on Twin Earth would be mistaken about the names that they use.  Rather, on Twin Earth, a speaker would correctly use the name 'aluminum' to refer to the metal that on Earth would be known as 'molybdenum.'
(Choice D)  According to Paragraph 2, ""the extension of 'water' on each world would actually be different, because it would apply to H2O on Earth but to XYZ on Twin Earth.  Therefore, Putnam argues that a term's meaning is constituted partially by the features of a speaker's world.""  Consequently, the Twin Earth thought experiments compare speakers on Earth with those on Twin Earth, such as ""an Earthling Oscar1 and his Twin Earth counterpart Oscar2"" (Paragraph 5).  However, such counterparts are not like biological twins, who typically share one and the same world.  Therefore, the passage gives no reason to think that biological twins would complicate the thought experiment."
"285","The passage author implies that the second version of the Twin Earth thought experiment:","C","51","This formulation avoids the problems inherent to ""twin water,"" as switching molybdenum and aluminum would not entail an essential physical difference between people on Earth and those on Twin Earth.  Thus this example might seem to justify Putnam's position on linguistic reference. (Paragraph 5)
However, some linguists, such as Crane, have posed an intriguing question in response to this claim.  Why not suppose that for Oscar1 and Oscar2, the extension of the word 'aluminum' is both aluminum and molybdenum?...  In that case, while 'aluminum' would indeed have the same intension on Earth and Twin-Earth, it would have the same extension as well, dissolving Putnam's argument. (Paragraph 6)
Putnam might object that only features of each man's actual world fixes the extension of 'aluminum.'  On that view, the term's meaning is not affected by the hypothetical question of how, for instance, Oscar1 would mentally classify a pan from Twin Earth.  But…  Crane's response to the Twin Earth scenario cannot be dismissed so easily. (Paragraph 7)
The second version of the thought experiment ""avoids the problems inherent to"" the original formulation; thus the author states that ""this example might seem to justify Putnam's position on linguistic reference"" (Paragraph 5).  However, the author also notes that ""some linguists, such as Crane, have posed an intriguing question in response to this claim.""  If that response is plausible, it would result in ""dissolving Putnam's argument"" (Paragraph 6).
Paragraph 7 suggests one way in which ""Putnam might object"" to Crane's response.  However, the author asserts that ""Crane's response to the Twin Earth scenario cannot be dismissed so easily.""  Accordingly, the author indicates that this response still needs to be addressed, implying that the second version of the Twin Earth thought experiment would require further argument to successfully justify Putnam's position.
By contrast, the author does not imply that the second version of the Twin Earth thought experiment:
suffers from the same problems as the original formulation of the scenario (Choice A).  In Paragraph 5, the author writes: ""This [second] formulation avoids the problems inherent to 'twin water'"" (ie, the first formulation of the scenario).
is decisively refuted by the response of Crane and other linguists (Choice B).  The author argues that ""Crane's response to the Twin Earth scenario cannot be dismissed so easily"" (Paragraph 7).  However, that assertion does not in itself mean that there is no other way to potentially defend Putnam's position.  Hence, to say that the Twin Earth thought experiment ""is decisively refuted"" by Crane's response would overstate the author's claim in the passage.
fails because people on Earth and Twin Earth would be psychologically dissimilar (Choice D).  Putnam argues that a man on Earth and a man on Twin Earth may have ""no difference at all in their psychological states when they use the word 'aluminum'"" (Paragraph 5).  However, the passage suggests that other linguists agree with this claim.  For instance, Crane accepts the idea that ""[i]f either man somehow encountered a pan from the other Earth, he would call its metal 'aluminum'"" (Paragraph 6), indicating that the two men's mental states would be similar in this regard."
"286","The author describes Putnam's original formulation of the Twin Earth scenario as ""incoherent"" because:
fictional scenarios do not tell us anything about the actual world.
people on Earth could not be physically identical to those on Twin Earth.
Putnam underestimates the role of internal mental states in linguistic reference.","B","51","In the experiment's original formulation, Putnam asks the reader to imagine Earth centuries in the past, along with a nearly identical Twin Earth.  However, while the substance called 'water' on Twin Earth is indistinguishable from Earth water in terms of appearance, taste, boiling point, etc., it is not H2O but a different chemical compound that Putnam calls 'XYZ.' (Paragraph 1)
The most immediate objection to Putnam's argument is that the situation described is incoherent, as the human body is largely composed of water.  Although this fact means that Putnam's description of Twin Earth is literally impossible, most scholars have been oddly willing to overlook this deficiency. (Paragraph 3)
This formulation avoids the problems inherent to ""twin water,"" as switching molybdenum and aluminum would not entail an essential physical difference between people on Earth and those on Twin Earth.  Thus this example might seem to justify Putnam's position on linguistic reference. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 1 conveys that in the original Twin Earth scenario ""Putnam asks the reader to imagine Earth…along with a nearly identical Twin Earth.  However, while the substance called 'water' on Twin Earth is indistinguishable from Earth water…it is not H2O but a different chemical compound that Putnam calls 'XYZ.'""  According to Paragraph 3, ""The most immediate objection to Putnam's argument is that the situation described is incoherent, as the human body is largely composed of water.""  The author notes that ""this fact means that Putnam's description of Twin Earth is literally impossible.""
Paragraph 5 specifies that the thought experiment's second formulation ""avoids the problems inherent to 'twin water,' as switching molybdenum and aluminum would not entail an essential physical difference between people on Earth and Twin Earth.""  In other words, people on Earth and Twin Earth could not really be identical in the first formulation, because the bodies of the former would be composed of H2O, while the bodies of the latter would be composed of XYZ.
Consequently, the author describes Putnam's original formulation of the Twin Earth scenario as incoherent because it entails that people on Earth could not be physically identical to those on Twin Earth. (Number II)
(Number I)  The author argues that in Putnam's first formulation ""the situation described is incoherent,"" viewing that fact as problematic even though ""most scholars have been oddly willing to overlook this deficiency"" (Paragraph 3).  Accordingly, the author believes there are flaws in Putnam's thought experiment.  However, he or she never objects to the fact that it involves fictional scenarios, nor argues that fictional scenarios cannot tell us about the actual world.
(Number III)  The thought experiment includes the idea that ""[p]eople on both worlds would possess the same concept of that term [water] and embody the same mental states while using it (Paragraph 2).  Hence, the passage conveys that Putnam takes account of the role of internal mental states in linguistic reference; the author never suggests that Putnam has underestimated that role.  Moreover, the author argues that ""the situation described is incoherent, as the human body is largely composed of water"" (Paragraph 3).  Therefore, the author's objection concerns facts about the physical composition of the human body, not about internal mental states."
"287","The author views the willingness of scholars to overlook the ""deficiency"" in Putnam's argument as:","B","51","The most immediate objection to Putnam's argument is that the situation described is incoherent, as the human body is largely composed of water.  Although this fact means that Putnam's description of Twin Earth is literally impossible, most scholars have been oddly willing to overlook this deficiency.  For instance, Dennett deems it irrelevant, while Ebbs opines that ""the difficulties it raises need not affect the point of the thought experiment."" (Paragraph 3)
If for whatever reason we ignore that objection, we may at least attend to a different example, set in contemporary times. (Paragraph 4)
The author emphasizes that ""Putnam's description of Twin Earth is literally impossible,"" but states that despite this fact ""most scholars have been oddly willing to overlook this deficiency"" (Paragraph 3).  Accordingly, the author suggests that the scholars' position is unexpected.  The author later continues: ""If for whatever reason we ignore that objection…"" suggesting puzzlement over the position taken by those scholars.  Therefore, the author views the willingness of scholars to overlook the ""deficiency"" in Putnam's argument as a surprising state of affairs.
(Choices A and D)  The author states that ""most scholars have been oddly willing to overlook this deficiency"" (Paragraph 3), implicitly questioning those scholars' position.  The author also remarks: ""If for whatever reason we ignore that objection, we may at least attend to a different example"" (Paragraph 4), further implying that he or she may disagree with the scholars' reasoning.  Consequently, the author is not convinced that overlooking the deficiency in Putnam's argument is a justified decision or a matter of practicality.
(Choice C)  The author objects to the fact that ""most scholars have been oddly willing to overlook this deficiency.""  However, he or she never suggests that those scholars have failed to comprehend the deficiency.  Rather, they are presented as simply viewing it as unimportant: ""For instance, Dennett deems it irrelevant, while Ebbs opines that 'the difficulties it raises need not affect the point of the thought experiment'"" (Paragraph 3)."
"288","Given the information in the passage, Putnam most likely set the first formulation of the Twin Earth thought experiment ""centuries in the past"" in order to:","A","51","A long-standing position in linguistics is that terms with the same intensional meaning must refer to the same objects in the world.  Hilary Putnam's ""Twin Earth"" thought experiment challenges this view by arguing that two speakers could use a term in the same way yet refer to different entities.  In the experiment's original formulation, Putnam asks the reader to imagine Earth centuries in the past, along with a nearly identical Twin Earth.  However, while the substance called 'water' on Twin Earth is indistinguishable from Earth water in terms of appearance, taste, boiling point, etc., it is not H2O but a different chemical compound that Putnam calls 'XYZ.' (Paragraph 1)
Given this scenario, the intension of the term 'water' would be the same on Earth and Twin Earth.  People on both worlds would possess the same concept of that term and embody the same mental states while using it.  However, the extension of 'water' on each world would actually be different, because it would apply to H2O on Earth but XYZ on Twin Earth. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 1, ""Hilary Putnam's 'Twin Earth' thought experiment…[argues] that two speakers could use a term in the same way yet refer to different entities.""  Putnam describes a scenario in which ""'water' on Twin Earth is indistinguishable from Earth water"" but is nevertheless ""a different chemical compound that Putnam calls 'XYZ.'""
Paragraph 2 conveys that ""[p]eople on both worlds would possess the same concept of that term [water] and embody the same mental states while using it.""  Nevertheless, the term 'water' would actually refer to different substances on each world, ""because it would apply to H2O on Earth but XYZ on Twin Earth.""  Therefore, the point of the scenario is to describe a situation in which two people had identical concepts of what a word means, yet the word did not refer to the same entity in both cases.
However, if people in the scenario knew the chemical composition of water or twin water, respectively, then they would have different conceptions of what the term 'water' means, undermining the point of the thought experiment.  Consequently, the thought experiment was most likely set centuries in the past to situate it prior to knowledge of chemistry, removing that complication.
By contrast, Putnam did not most likely set the first formulation of the Twin Earth thought experiment ""centuries in the past"" in order to:
reflect the longevity of the standard linguistic position (Choice B).  Paragraph 1 states that Putnam's thought experiment challenges ""[a] long-standing position in linguistics.""  However, the passage never suggests that Putnam's thought experiment needed to reflect the longevity of that position.
make it easier for deficiencies in his argument to be overlooked (Choice C).  Paragraph 3 describes a flaw in Putnam's original thought experiment, but notes that ""most scholars have been oddly willing to overlook this deficiency.""  However, the passage never suggests that Putnam was aware of the deficiency in advance yet simply hoped for it to be overlooked instead of correcting it.
allow the second version to be comparatively stronger (Choice D).  Paragraph 5 states that the second version of the thought experiment ""avoids the problems inherent to 'twin water,'"" implying that the second formulation is stronger than the first in this respect.  However, the author never suggests that Putnam intentionally chose the setting of the first formulation to make the second version stronger by comparison."
"289","Based on Gorgias' arguments in the passage, the claim that Helen is to blame for the Trojan War:","D","52","It instead defends the woman who, by abandoning her husband, King Menelaus of Sparta, and eloping with the Trojan prince Paris, has perennially borne the blame for instigating the Trojan War.  Thus, in advocating for her innocence, Gorgias' efforts must aim not just at absolving a wayward wife of wrongdoing, but at toppling the long-held tradition that turned a Greek matriarch into a traitor of country and consort. (Paragraph 1)
Firstly, Gorgias submits, Helen is not guilty since her departure to Troy was likely the will of the gods or the result of fate or chance—forces against which she was powerless.  Alternatively, she may have been physically coerced, in which case she stood helpless against her abductor.  It is also conceivable that the Spartan queen, enamored at the sight of the Trojan prince, was the victim of Love, a powerful deity against which she could hardly have been expected to prevail. (Paragraph 2)
A further possibility—one that Gorgias entertains at length—cites the efficacy of speech, for despite the ""subtlety"" of its material substance, speech is a ""mighty despot.""  Certainly, as Gorgias proposes, when persuasion is added to speech, it ""molds the mind in the way it wishes.""  Furthermore, he posits, its effect on the mind is ""as irresistible as that of drugs on the body.""  Therefore, the blame for Helen's seduction and consequent defection belongs not to the one persuaded, but to the persuader. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 1 conveys the traditional view of Helen as ""the woman who, by abandoning her husband…and eloping with the Trojan prince Paris, has perennially borne the blame for instigating the Trojan War.""  By contrast, in Paragraph 2, Gorgias claims that ""Helen is not guilty since her departure to Troy was likely the will of the gods or the result of fate or chance""—or, alternatively, of physical coercion or victimization by Love—all ""forces against which she was powerless.""
In Paragraph 3, Gorgias ""cites the efficacy (power) of speech,"" stating that ""when persuasion is added to speech, it 'molds the mind in the way it wishes,'"" producing an effect ""'as irresistible as that of drugs on the body.'""  Gorgias thus concludes that ""the blame for Helen's seduction and consequent defection belongs not to the one persuaded, but to the persuader.""
Accordingly, in each of Gorgias' arguments, forces beyond Helen's control precipitated her departure from Greece.  However, the traditional view, namely, that Helen is to blame for the Trojan War, attaches too much importance to human agency, ignoring the role of these nonhuman forces.
 By contrast, each of the following reflects an aspect of Gorgias' defense of Helen rather than the view that she is to blame for the war:
exaggerates the power of persuasion (Choice A).  In Paragraph 3, Gorgias ""cites the efficacy of speech,"" comparing it to a ""'mighty despot.'""  He claims that ""when persuasion is added to speech, it 'molds the mind in the way it wishes,'"" producing an effect ""'as irresistible as that of drugs on the body.'""  Consequently, Gorgias concludes, ""the blame for Helen's seduction and consequent defection belongs not to the one persuaded, but to the persuader.""  Therefore, blaming Helen rather than Paris actually underestimates the power of persuasion in her decision to depart.
exaggerates the role of Trojan aggression (Choice B).  According to Gorgias' argument in Paragraph 2, Helen ""may have been physically coerced, in which case she stood helpless against her abductor.""  This reference to the possibly coercive behavior of the Trojan prince Paris emphasizes that Trojan aggression may have factored into Helen's departure from Greece.  However, the traditional view of Helen as ""abandoning her husband…and eloping with…Paris"" (Paragraph 1), and thus as responsible for the war, denies the role of Trojan aggression in the incident.
attaches too much importance to divine agency (Choice C).  Gorgias claims that ""Helen is not guilty since her departure to Troy was likely the will of the gods or a result of fate or chance—forces against which she was powerless.""  He also proposes that ""enamored"" by Paris, she became ""the victim of Love, a powerful deity against which she could hardly have been expected to prevail"" (Paragraph 2).  Consequently, Gorgias attaches great importance to the role of divine agency in Helen's desertion, whereas the traditional view, by blaming her, attaches more importance to human agency."
"290","Many other Greek writers have offered their own narratives about Helen of Troy.  Which of the following accounts is most in accord with Gorgias' arguments in Paragraph 2?","B","52","In support of the much-maligned matron, the ancient rhetorician marshals a series of arguments that while following the laws of logic, seem more fanciful than probable.  Firstly, Gorgias submits, Helen is not guilty since her departure to Troy was likely the will of the gods or the result of fate or chance—forces against which she was powerless.  Alternatively, she may have been physically coerced, in which case she stood helpless against her abductor.  It is also conceivable that the Spartan queen, enamored at the sight of the Trojan prince, was the victim of Love, a powerful deity against which she could hardly have been expected to prevail. (Paragraph 2)
In Paragraph 2, Gorgias argues that ""Helen is not guilty since her departure to Troy was likely the will of the gods or the result of fate or chance—forces against which she was powerless.""  He then goes on to propose that she ""may have been physically coerced,"" before relating that ""[i]t is also conceivable that the Spartan queen, enamored at the sight of the Trojan prince, was the victim of Love, a powerful deity against which she could hardly have been expected to prevail.""  This argument would most closely correspond with the account from Euripides' Trojan Women that Paris and Helen's love affair represented the fulfillment of a curse by Aphrodite.  Accordingly, Helen's elopement with Paris would not have been her fault, but the fault of the goddess who is often represented as the deity of love.
 By contrast, the following accounts, because they attribute more agency to Helen, are less in accord with Gorgias' arguments:
Homer's Odyssey:  Helen claimed that although she was a Trojan captive, she bravely risked helping the Greeks during the war (Choice A). In Paragraph 2, Gorgias argues that Helen is innocent because the gods, fate, chance, physical force, love, or language—""forces against which she was powerless""—compelled her departure to Troy.  Accordingly, Gorgias portrays Helen as a mere victim of external forces without suggesting that she deserves credit for trying to help the Greeks during the war.
Isocrates' Speech in Praise of Helen:  Helen heroically embraced her designated fate as the daughter of the god Zeus (Choice C). In Paragraph 2, Gorgias claims that ""Helen is not guilty since her departure to Troy was likely the will of the gods or the result of fate or chance—forces against which she was powerless.""  Accordingly, Gorgias portrays Helen as a helpless victim of her fate rather than as a semi-divine martyr accepting of her fate.
Stesichorus' Palinode:  Helen was escorted to Egypt to avoid abduction but was still blamed for the war because a look-alike was sent to Troy in her place (Choice D).  In Paragraph 2, Gorgias argues that Helen ""may have been physically coerced, in which case she stood helpless against her abductor.""  Accordingly, Gorgias portrays Helen as the victim of her abductor and so not to blame for starting the war.  He does not offer an alibi to the effect that she was never abducted or never went to Troy."
"291","Gorgias seems to undermine his own purpose in the Encomium by doing which of the following?","D","52","Thus, in advocating for her innocence, Gorgias' efforts must aim not just at absolving a wayward wife of wrongdoing, but at toppling the long-held tradition that turned a Greek matriarch into a traitor of country and consort. (Paragraph 1)
Gorgias' systematic defense culminates in a complicated quod erat demonstrandum.  The orator proclaims that by revealing the truth he has not only countered ignorance but exonerated Helen from blame, thus freeing her from ignominy.  However, the Encomium now threatens to tarnish its own reputation.  In a final self-referential and self-contradictory twist, perhaps designed to cast doubt on authorial intent, the sophist discloses: ""I have composed this speech to praise Helen—and as an amusement for myself."" (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 1 states that ""in advocating for her innocence, Gorgias' efforts…aim…at absolving a wayward wife of wrongdoing…[and] toppling the long-held tradition.""  In Paragraph 5, Gorgias ""proclaims that by revealing the truth he has not only countered ignorance but exonerated (unburdened) Helen from blame, thus freeing her from ignominy (public disgrace).""  However, Paragraph 5 also conveys that ""[i]n a final self-referential and self-contradictory twist, perhaps designed to cast doubt on authorial intent, the sophist discloses: 'I have composed this speech to praise Helen—and as an amusement for myself.'""
Accordingly, Gorgias claims that he has achieved his aim of absolving Helen; he also suggests that he may have composed this speech to amuse himself, thus seeming to trivialize it.  Therefore, by teasing his audience that he might not be serious, after claiming to have spoken the truth, Gorgias could be seen to undermine his own purpose in the Encomium.
 By contrast, Gorgias does not seem to undermine his own purpose in the Encomium by:
maintaining faith in language's power, after revealing its seemingly deceptive nature (Choice A).  Gorgias compares speech to a ""'mighty despot'"" and says that ""when persuasion is added to speech, it 'molds the mind in the way it wishes,'"" producing an effect ""'as irresistible as that of drugs on the body'"" (Paragraph 3).  Gorgias thus ""transfers the culpability (blame) for Helen's desertion…onto [Paris'] words and onto the whole of language as an overpowering and potentially deceptive force.""  Accordingly, speech's potentially deceptive effect on the listener is a form of persuasion and illustrates language's power.  Hence, language's claim to power is not incompatible with a potentially deceptive nature.
deliberately employing a sophistic strategy, after acknowledging its questionable reputation (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 1, ""defending the infamous Helen amounts to defending the indefensible.""  Furthermore, ""[b]y undertaking this task, Gorgias risks incurring the accusation frequently hurled by conservative thinkers at the…sophists…of contriving (engineering) to make the weaker argument the stronger.""  However, regardless of whether Gorgias was consciously employing this sophistic strategy, the passage never suggests that he acknowledged its questionable reputation.
composing a complicated defense of his subject, after suggesting he would praise her (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 1, ""[d]espite advertising itself as an 'encomium,' or speech in praise of an individual, the text does not proceed to laud its subject…Helen of Troy.  It instead defends the woman who…has perennially borne the blame for instigating the Trojan War.""  This information suggests that, although titled an ""encomium,"" as if meant to praise Helen, the speech functions more properly as a defense.  However, in Paragraph 5, Gorgias concludes that he composed the speech (in part) ""to praise Helen.""  Gorgias further observes that he has accomplished his purpose, namely to ""exonerate…Helen from blame [and] free…her from ignominy"" by telling the truth.  Accordingly, the passage shows that composing a speech in Helen's defense is complicated because in order to defend her, Gorgias must redeem her reputation or, in effect, praise her."
"292","What does the discussion of Gorgias' style in Paragraph 4 suggest about the way his rhetoric functions?","C","52","It is noteworthy, though typical of Gorgias, that he uses his innovative and elaborate style to reflect the substance of the Encomium with all its paradoxes.  His distinctively paradoxical style mixes poetry with prose, overflows with rhetorical figures, and juxtaposes contrasting terms.  The results are often spellbinding—indeed, the most ornate examples of Gorgianic oratory have been likened to magical incantations but also subject to unfair attacks from imperceptive critics denouncing them as ""a plethora of words and a paucity of ideas."" (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, ""It is noteworthy, though typical of Gorgias, that he uses his innovative and elaborate style to reflect the substance of the Encomium with all its paradoxes.""  As Paragraph 4 describes, ""[h]is distinctively paradoxical style mixes poetry with prose, overflows with rhetorical figures, and juxtaposes contrasting terms.""
This information indicates that Gorgias' ""distinctively paradoxical style"" mirrors the substance or content of his works, such as the Encomium, which are likewise typically paradoxical or ironic in character.  Therefore, the discussion of Gorgias' style in Paragraph 4 suggests that his rhetoric functions so that Gorgianic style and content often reinforce one another.
 (Choice A)  Gorgianic style is excessive verbiage without substance.  According to Paragraph 4, Gorgias' style is ""often spellbinding"" and some of his more elaborate speeches have been ""likened to magical incantations.""  As a result, his works have been ""subject to unfair attacks from imperceptive critics denouncing them as 'a plethora (overabundance) of words and a paucity (scarcity) of ideas.'""  Accordingly, this information implies that such types of criticisms can be dismissed as largely illegitimate.  Therefore, the discussion of Gorgias' style in Paragraph 4 suggests that his rhetoric has actual substance and is not just a lot of empty words.
(Choice B)  Gorgianic style was developed specifically to defend the indefensible.  According to Paragraph 1, ""defending the infamous Helen amounts to defending the indefensible.""  Paragraph 4 then states, ""It is…typical of Gorgias, that he uses his innovative and elaborate style to reflect the substance of the Encomium with all its paradoxes.  That distinctively paradoxical style mixes poetry with prose, overflows with rhetorical figures, and juxtaposes contrasting terms.""  Consequently, Gorgias' paradoxical style tends to mirror the likewise ironic or paradoxical content of his speeches.  However, the passage never suggests that Gorgianic style was developed specifically to accomplish the essentially paradoxical rhetorical task of defending the indefensible.
(Choice D)  Gorgianic style frequently sabotages the ideas in a speech.  Paragraph 4 describes Gorgias' style as ""innovative and elaborate"" as well as ""distinctively paradoxical,"" mixing ""poetry with prose"" and featuring ""rhetorical figures"" and ""contrasting terms.""  Furthermore, Paragraph 4 then conveys that the style is ""spellbinding"" and ""the most ornate examples…have been likened to magical incantations but also subject to unfair attacks from imperceptive critics denouncing them as 'a plethora of words and a paucity of ideas.'""  This evidence suggests that Gorgias' unique style can produce texts with a disproportionately greater quantity of words compared to the quantity of ideas.  However, such a scenario indicates only that the words might overwhelm or somehow distract from the ideas in a speech, not that Gorgianic style would actually sabotage (deliberately destroy) these ideas."
"293","Which of the following assertions best exemplifies Gorgias' conception of language as it is presented in Paragraph 3?","B","52","A further possibility—one that Gorgias entertains at length—cites the efficacy of speech, for despite the ""subtlety"" of its material substance, speech is a ""mighty despot.""  Certainly, as Gorgias proposes, when persuasion is added to speech, it ""molds the mind in the way it wishes.""  Furthermore, he posits, its effect on the mind is ""as irresistible as that of drugs on the body.""  Therefore, the blame for Helen's seduction and consequent defection belongs not to the one persuaded, but to the persuader.  With this startling refutation, the sophist transfers the culpability for Helen's desertion not just onto the Trojan Paris as her seducer, but onto his words and onto the whole of language as an overpowering and potentially deceptive force. (Paragraph 3)
In Paragraph 3, Gorgias ""cites the efficacy (power) of speech,"" comparing it to a ""'mighty despot.'""  He states that ""when persuasion is added to speech, it 'molds the mind in the way it wishes,'"" producing an effect ""'as irresistible as that of drugs on the body.'""  Gorgias then concludes that ""the blame for Helen's seduction…belongs not to the one persuaded, but to the persuader,"" and quite possibly belongs even to ""the whole of language as an overpowering and potentially deceptive force.""
Accordingly, language, as irresistibly persuasive and potentially deceptive, has the power to affect the listener's mind.  It follows that a speaker can use language to persuade the listener to let go of one point of view and adopt another.  Consequently, Gorgias' conception of language as presented in Paragraph 3 is best exemplified by the assertion that speech is a means of realigning the listener's perspective.
 (Choice A)  Speech is a means of conveying the speaker's thoughts objectively.  In Paragraph 3, Gorgias claims that ""when persuasion is added to speech, it 'molds the mind in the way it wishes,'"" producing an effect ""'as irresistible as that of drugs on the body.'""  Gorgias also states that language can be ""an overpowering and potentially deceptive force.""  Given these qualities, speech as portrayed by Gorgias is not exclusively or primarily a means of communicating thoughts in an unbiased or objective manner.
(Choices C and D)  Speech is a means of guiding the listener down a wrong path; and Speech is a means of convincing the listener of the truth.  In Paragraph 3, Gorgias claims that ""when persuasion is added to speech, it 'molds the mind in the way it wishes,'"" producing an effect ""'as irresistible as that of drugs on the body.'""  Furthermore, Gorgias describes ""the whole of language as an overpowering and potentially deceptive force.""  Accordingly, Gorgias' conception of language emphasizes speech's overwhelming power to persuade and potentially deceive.  However, this conception does not imply that speech's persuasive power is solely or primarily used either to mislead the listener or to compel the listener to believe the truth."
"294","Suppose an art student plans to analyze a painting classified as part of the Impressionist movement.  The passage author would most likely recommend that:","C","53","The danger of this state of affairs is the prospect that works of art will be fitted to theories instead of theories being fitted to works of art.  While theory cannot be abandoned, it must follow criticism rather than lead it.  Otherwise, both beginning students and established art historians may find their analyses guided toward conclusions that are more or less pre-ordained, like detectives who begin an investigation with a suspect already in mind.  An artwork's style and features must be discovered from the bottom up, letting the work speak to us on its own terms and reducing the chance that important evidence is misconstrued or overlooked. (Paragraph 3)
Even apart from such concerns, it is beneficial overall for works to be studied free of theoretical constraints.  This is not because established theory is necessarily wrong, but because doing so allows critical insights to develop organically. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 3 discusses the ""danger…that works of art will be fitted to theories instead of theories being fitted to works of art.""  The author warns that if theory is too influential when studying an artwork, scholars ""may find their analyses guided toward conclusions that are more or less pre-ordained (determined in advance), like detectives who begin an investigation with a suspect already in mind.""  Accordingly, the author asserts that ""[a]n artwork's style and features must be discovered from the bottom up, letting the work speak to us on its own terms.""
The author further emphasizes this point in Paragraph 5, stating that ""it is beneficial overall for works to be studied free of theoretical constraints…because doing so allows critical insights to develop organically.""  Thus he or she argues that art must be studied in itself, without letting existing theory about a work influence its analysis.
Consequently, if an art student plans to analyze a painting classified as part of the Impressionist movement, the passage author would most likely recommend that the analysis should proceed without considering the typical features of Impressionism.
 (Choice A)  the analysis should employ methodology similar to that of a detective investigating a case.  The author argues that ""theory…must follow criticism rather than lead it,"" because otherwise analyses of art may be ""guided toward conclusions that are more or less pre-ordained, like detectives who begin an investigation with a suspect already in mind.""  Therefore, a comparison to detectives is made to illustrate one of the author's points.  However, the author does not suggest that art analysis should employ methodology similar to that of a detective investigating a case.
(Choices B and D)  the analysis should incorporate information about the most characteristic features of Impressionist paintings; and the analysis should take into account facts about the particular Impressionist who created the painting.  The author warns about ""the prospect that works of art will be fitted to theories instead of theories being fitted to works of art,"" asserting that ""theory…must follow criticism rather than lead it"" (Paragraph 3).  By contrast, allowing an analysis to incorporate information about the most characteristic features of Impressionist paintings or facts about a particular Impressionist painter would constitute the opposite practice, with theory leading criticism.  Consequently, the passage author would not recommend either of these approaches."
"295","The problems in art scholarship addressed by Youngna Kim relate to which of the following issues?
I.  Non-academic agendas
II.  Inadequate funding for research
III.  Inequities between fields of study","C","53","For instance, a regrettably long-standing assumption in Asian art studies was that Korean artworks were dependent upon outside cultural influences from China or Japan.  In some cases, this belief was the result of honest mistakes, albeit ones that more attentive research might have avoided.  As Youngna Kim stresses, however, we must not ignore the perceived value of that assumption to those wishing to justify Korea's former status as an occupied nation.  In the years since Korea gained independence in 1945, the original, non-derivative insights of Korean art have begun to be recognized.  Still, Kim points out that as recently as 1994, the fifth edition of A History of Far Eastern Art included ""only 17 Korean artworks, compared with about 240 from Japan.""  Although progress continues to be made, challenges to establishing Korean art as a more comparably sized discipline remain. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, ""a regrettably long-standing assumption in Asian art studies was that Korean artworks were dependent upon outside cultural influences from China or Japan.""  Although the author states that ""[i]n some cases, this belief was the result of honest mistakes,"" he or she also cites Youngna Kim's point about ""the perceived value of that assumption to those wishing to justify Korea's former status as an occupied nation.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that this problematic assumption resulted partially from a non-academic agenda (ie, a political one) (Number I).
Paragraph 4 states that ""[i]n the years since Korea gained independence in 1945, the original, non-derivative insights of Korean art have begun to be recognized.""  However, this recognition has proceeded slowly, as ""Kim points out that as recently as 1994, the fifth edition of A History of Far Eastern Art included 'only 17 Korean artworks, compared with about 240 from Japan.'""  Accordingly, the passage states that ""challenges to establishing Korean art as a more comparably sized discipline remain.""  Therefore, the problems addressed by Youngna Kim relate in part to inequities between fields of study, specifically inequities between Korean art and art originating in other parts of Asia (Number III).
  (Number II)  Inadequate funding for research.  Paragraph 4 discusses the ""regrettably long-standing assumption…that Korean artworks were dependent upon outside cultural influences from China or Japan.""  According to the author, ""[i]n some cases, this belief was the result of honest mistakes, albeit ones that more attentive research might have avoided.""  Therefore, the author criticizes the quality of research performed in relation to this assumption.  However, he or she never connects this criticism to lack of funding, nor discusses the funding provided for art history research in Korea.  Consequently, the passage does not suggest that the problems in art scholarship addressed by Youngna Kim relate to inadequate funding for research."
"296","Given the information in the passage, the author's intended audience is most likely:","A","53","The overemphasis on theory in art scholarship is lampooned in the 1997 film Bean.  In an early exchange between its principal characters… (Paragraph 1)
Although the purpose of the movie scene is simply comedic effect, Joan Holladay has made a similar point quite seriously about her work collaborating on Gothic Sculpture in America.  Reflecting on this experience, she writes: ""One of the more sobering lessons was that we may not be training our students very well at old-fashioned looking.  With the increasing interest in theory, connoisseurship has fallen by the wayside; one younger colleague had considerable trouble finding appropriate stylistic comparisons, while another noted, 'I think I'm not very good at this.'"" (Paragraph 2)
While theory cannot be abandoned, it must follow criticism rather than lead it.  Otherwise, both beginning students and established art historians may find their analyses guided toward conclusions that are more or less pre-ordained, like detectives who begin an investigation with a suspect already in mind.  An artwork's style and features must be discovered from the bottom up, letting the work speak to us on its own terms and reducing the chance that important evidence is misconstrued or overlooked. (Paragraph 3)
The author is concerned about ""[t]he overemphasis on theory in art scholarship"" (Paragraph 1), citing Joan Holladay's observation that ""'we may not be training our students very well at old-fashioned looking.  With the increasing interest in theory, connoisseurship (critical familiarity or expertise) has fallen by the wayside'"" (Paragraph 2).  Thus, the passage alludes to the way students are trained in art history.
Similarly, Paragraph 3 states that ""theory…must follow criticism rather than lead it.  Otherwise, both beginning students and established art historians may find their analyses guided toward conclusions that are more or less pre-ordained (determined in advance).""  The author then recommends that ""[a]n artwork's style and features must be discovered from the bottom up, letting the work speak to us on its own terms.""  As such, the passage also refers to the way works of art are analyzed.
Therefore, as the passage seems directed toward readers involved with both analyzing art and training students, the author's intended audience is most likely professors of art history at universities.
  (Choice B)  administrators of art museums.  The passage discusses issues related to ""[t]he overemphasis on theory in art scholarship"" (Paragraph 1), such as how ""analyses [are] guided toward conclusions"" (Paragraph 3) and allowing works of art ""to be studied free of theoretical constraints"" (Paragraph 5).  However, although works of art are often displayed in museums, the passage never discusses issues related to how those museums are administrated.
(Choice C)  students taking classes in art history.  Paragraph 2 cites Joan Holladay's observation that ""we may not be training our students very well at old-fashioned looking.  With the increasing interest in theory, connoisseurship has fallen by the wayside.'""  This statement suggests that the way art history students are trained might need to be adjusted in order to provide them with greater skills.  Accordingly, the author's intended audience is more likely to be those who teach classes in art history, rather than the students taking those classes.
(Choice D)  researchers working in the field of Korean art.  In Paragraph 4, the author discusses the ""regrettably long-standing assumption in Asian art studies…that Korean artworks were dependent upon outside cultural influences from China or Japan.""  However, the passage also refers to ""Joan Holladay['s]…work collaborating on Gothic Sculpture in America"" (Paragraph 2) and ""James McNeill Whistler's Portrait of the Artist's Mother"" (Paragraph 5), suggesting that Korean art is one example in support of a larger theme.  Therefore, the author's intended audience is most likely broader than just researchers working in the field of Korean art."
"297","Based on the discussion of Korean art in Paragraph 4, with which of the following assertions would Youngna Kim most likely agree?","D","53","As Youngna Kim stresses, however, we must not ignore the perceived value of that assumption to those wishing to justify Korea's former status as an occupied nation.  In the years since Korea gained independence in 1945, the original, non-derivative insights of Korean art have begun to be recognized.  Still, Kim points out that as recently as 1994, the fifth edition of A History of Far Eastern Art included ""only 17 Korean artworks, compared with about 240 from Japan.""  Although progress continues to be made, challenges to establishing Korean art as a more comparably sized discipline remain. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 states that ""[i]n the years since Korea gained independence in 1945, the original, non-derivative insights of Korean art have begun to be recognized.""  However, Youngna Kim indicates that this recognition has come slowly, noting that ""as recently as 1994, the fifth edition of A History of Far Eastern Art included 'only 17 Korean artworks, compared with about 240 from Japan.'""  Accordingly, the passage relates that ""although progress continues to be made, challenges to establishing Korean art as a more comparably sized discipline remain.""
Therefore, although scholarship in Korean art has evolved since 1945, Youngna Kim would most likely agree that Korean art faces significant obstacles despite the country having gained independence in 1945.
  By contrast, Youngna Kim would not most likely agree that:
Most Korean artworks have been accidentally misattributed to outside cultural influences (Choice A).  Paragraph 4 discusses the ""regrettably long-standing assumption…that Korean artworks were dependent upon outside cultural influences from China or Japan.""  In response to this claim, ""Youngna Kim stresses [that] we must not ignore the perceived value of that assumption to those wishing to justify Korea's former status as an occupied nation.""  Therefore, Kim does not suggest that most Korean artworks have been accidentally misattributed to outside cultural influences.  Rather, she implies that such misattributions were made intentionally due to political motives.
A History of Far Eastern Art included fewer Korean examples in 1994 than in previous years (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 4, ""[i]n the years since Korea gained independence in 1945, the original, non-derivative insights of Korean art have begun to be recognized.  Still, Kim points out that as recently as 1994, the fifth edition of A History of Far Eastern Art included 'only 17 Korean artworks, compared with about 240 from Japan.'""  Therefore, passage information suggests that representation of Korean art has gradually increased since 1945, although this increase has come at a slow pace.
The original insights of Korean art have increased in number since 1945 (Choice C).  Paragraph 4 states that ""[i]n the years since Korea gained independence in 1945, the original, non-derivative insights of Korean art have begun to be recognized.""  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that Korean art itself changed after 1945; rather, it suggests that art scholarship has changed in more frequently recognizing the original insights of Korean art."
"298","Based on the passage, the ""bottom up"" approach to analyzing artwork described in Paragraph 3 would primarily involve which of the following?","D","53","The danger of this state of affairs is the prospect that works of art will be fitted to theories instead of theories being fitted to works of art.  While theory cannot be abandoned, it must follow criticism rather than lead it.  Otherwise, both beginning students and established art historians may find their analyses guided toward conclusions that are more or less pre-ordained, like detectives who begin an investigation with a suspect already in mind.  An artwork's style and features must be discovered from the bottom up, letting the work speak to us on its own terms and reducing the chance that important evidence is misconstrued or overlooked. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 discusses the danger ""that works of art will be fitted to theories instead of theories being fitted to works of art.""  The author warns that in such cases, ""both beginning students and established art historians may find their analyses guided toward conclusions that are more or less pre-ordained (determined in advance).""  In other words, the author argues that if art theory guides the study of a particular work of art, then conclusions about that artwork may be biased by pre-existing ideas and not accurately reflect the features of the artwork itself.
Consequently, the author's assertion in Paragraph 3 that ""[a]n artwork's style and features must be discovered from the bottom up, letting the work speak to us on its own terms"" would most likely involve ignoring prior research in the artwork's genre as initially irrelevant.
  By contrast, that ""bottom up"" approach to analyzing artwork would not primarily involve:
Accepting the insights only of scholars proven to be credible (Choice A).  The author warns about the possibility that ""both beginning students and established art historians may find their analyses guided toward conclusions that are more or less pre-ordained"" (Paragraph 3).  Accepting the insights of other scholars could guide analysis in the way the author argues against, and the author never makes a distinction regarding whether a scholar is credible.  Consequently, this approach would not be part of the author's ""bottom up"" analysis.
Undermining existing theory about the work in question (Choice B).  Paragraph 5 states that artworks should be ""studied free of theoretical constraints…not because established theory is necessarily wrong, but because doing so allows critical insights to develop organically.""  Therefore, the author's goal is not to undermine existing theory, but to prevent it from unduly influencing art scholarship.
Exposing the political agenda motivating previous analyses (Choice C).  Paragraph 4 states that the author's approach to art analysis ""helps to mitigate (lessen) the risks of misclassification or critical complacency (unreflective acceptance), as well as the related issue of scholarship's contamination by political interests.""  Paragraph 5 then states: ""Even apart from such concerns, it is beneficial overall for works to be studied free of theoretical constraints.""  Accordingly, although the author's approach might expose political agendas in some cases, that is just one aspect of its general purpose of preventing theory from overly influencing analysis."
"299","Which of the following most aptly describes Robinson's perspective on the use of semicolons (Paragraph 1)?","B","54","Although the semicolon frequently substitutes for a conjoining word—for example, ""and"" or ""but""—unlike those terms, it fails to elucidate the nature of the relationship between the information conveyed on either side of it.  Thus, as writer Paul Robinson points out, the semicolon creates a dubious linkage he suspects may ""gloss over imprecise thought.""  Robinson also impugns the hybridized mark as likely superfluous, implying that nearly half of all semicolons might be replaced with periods while for more than a quarter, the comma would suffice. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 leads into writer Paul Robinson's view on the semicolon with a general description of how the mark functions, noting that ""[a]lthough the semicolon frequently substitutes for a conjoining word—for example, 'and' or 'but'—unlike such terms, it fails to elucidate (make clear) the nature of the relationship between the information conveyed on either side of it.""  This description is similar to Robinson's perspective that a semicolon ""creates a dubious linkage he suspects may 'gloss over (conceal or disguise) imprecise thought.'""  Thus, Robinson views semicolons as connecting ideas in a sentence in ways that tend to be uncertain or vague.  Therefore, the statement that semicolons promote the loose correlation of ideas most aptly describes Robinson's perspective on the use of semicolons.
 (Choice A)  Semicolons merely separate independent clauses.  According to Paragraph 1, ""Although the semicolon frequently substitutes for a conjoining word—for example, 'and' or 'but'—unlike such terms, it fails to elucidate the nature of the relationship between the information conveyed on either side of it.""  In a similar vein, Paragraph 1 presents Robinson's view of semicolons as creating ""dubious linkage[s]"" between clauses that he suspects may ""gloss over imprecise thought.""  This view emphasizes the possibility that semicolons can be used as much to link as to separate.  Furthermore, such a perspective communicates the suspicion that semicolons conceal a lack of clarity or specificity.  Consequently, Robinson's perspective is more nuanced than the idea that semicolons merely separate independent clauses.
(Choice C)  Semicolons help convey the author's specific meaning.  Paragraph 1 reveals how, in Robinson's view, ""the semicolon creates a dubious linkage he suspects may 'gloss over imprecise thought.'""  Accordingly, Robinson believes semicolons tend to disguise a lack of precision in thought that leaves the author's meaning vague or general.  In Robinson's perspective, then, semicolons do not help convey the author's specific meaning.
(Choice D)  Semicolons serve a function distinct from that of other marks.  As Paragraph 1 claims, Robinson has attacked the semicolon ""as likely superfluous,"" suggesting that ""nearly half of all semicolons might be replaced with periods,"" and that for many of the rest, ""the comma would suffice.""  Therefore, Robinson's perspective is that semicolons frequently do not serve a function distinct from that of other marks of punctuation."
"300","The main point of Paragraph 3 is best described by which of the following?","D","54","For all its purported deficiencies and disadvantages, the semicolon came to boast sundry useful functions.  Perhaps the most indisputable is the ability to effectively organize items in a sentence otherwise cluttered with too many commas.  As a versatile mark of myriad possibilities, the semicolon was enthusiastically embraced by the likes of George Bernard Shaw and Virginia Woolf; the latter used them idiosyncratically to stitch disparate grammatical structures into paragraph-long sentences.  In Truss' opinion, employing a semicolon represents one of the highest compliments a writer can pay her readership, as if to say that the perspicacious reader is eminently capable of deciphering authorial innuendo.  More subtle than a period, more substantive than a comma, the semicolon breeds nuance, hinting at hermeneutical depths. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 discusses some different possible uses for the semicolon, emphasizing how ""[f]or all its purported (supposed) deficiencies and disadvantages, the semicolon came to boast sundry (several or various) useful functions""; one of these is ""to effectively organize items in a sentence otherwise cluttered with too many commas.""
In addition, the semicolon is described as ""versatile"" and said to offer ""myriad (countless) possibilities"" that ""were enthusiastically embraced"" by some well-known writers.  For example, Virginia Woolf ""used them idiosyncratically to stitch disparate (different) grammatical structures into paragraph-long sentences.""  Finally, the author relays Lynne Truss' opinion that ""employing a semicolon represents one of the highest compliments a writer can pay her readership.""
Accordingly, Paragraph 3 suggests that the semicolon has many functions and describes three distinct purposes for which authors might use it.  Therefore, the statement that authors have adapted the use of semicolons for a variety of purposes best describes the main point of Paragraph 3.
 By contrast, each of the following statements describes just one facet of Paragraph 3's main point:
An author might use a semicolon as a way to pay the reader a compliment (Choice A).  Paragraph 3 presents Truss' view that ""employing a semicolon represents one of the highest compliments a writer can pay her readership, as if to say that the perspicacious (astute) reader is eminently capable of deciphering authorial innuendo (ie, suggestion or hint from the author).""  However, Paragraph 3 does highlight other uses for semicolons, such as organizing long sentences or serving an author's idiosyncratic writing style.
Semicolons may be problematic, but they can regulate other punctuation marks (Choice B).  Paragraph 3 emphasizes that while the semicolon has ""purported deficiencies and disadvantages,"" it eventually ""came to boast sundry useful functions,"" the most indisputable being its ""ability to effectively organize items in a sentence otherwise cluttered with too many commas.""  However, as the passage indicates, authors can also use semicolons idiosyncratically or even, according to Truss, to pay the reader a compliment.
Some authors are notable for their idiosyncratic use of semicolons (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 3, ""the likes of George Bernard Shaw and Virginia Woolf"" were eager to make use of the seemingly versatile new semicolon.  Woolf in particular ""used [semicolons] idiosyncratically to stitch disparate grammatical structures into paragraph-long sentences.""  However, Paragraph 3 also stresses that semicolons have an ""indisputable"" function, namely, ""to effectively organize items in a sentence otherwise cluttered with too many commas.""  In addition, the author conveys Truss' view that ""employing a semicolon represents one of the highest compliments a writer can pay her readership."""
"301","What does the passage author imply in the last paragraph about Italian printer Aldus Manutius?","C","54","With Manutius—who also introduced the italic font and gave the comma its distinctive contours—punctuation came of age, moving from a matter of the author's discretion to a matter of rules as society progressed from oral recitation to silent reading.  Thus, rather than a servant of prosody, merely marking pauses like musical notation, punctuation became the handmaid of syntax, purveying sense along with style. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 details how Manutius not only invented the semicolon but made other contributions to punctuation—for example, he ""introduced the italic font and gave the comma its distinctive contours.""  By referring to the contours of the comma which give the mark its shape as ""distinctive,"" the author indicates that those contours are still recognizable and characteristic of the comma's form today, more than five hundred years later.  Consequently, in the last paragraph, the passage author implies that Aldus Manutius transformed the shape of the comma into a version that proved enduring.
 (Choice A)  He suggested typographical innovations that others found hard to embrace.  Paragraph 4 relays Cecilia Watson's account of the reception of Manutius' newly invented semicolon: ""[N]o sooner had the ink dried on its premier instantiation (representation) than the mark began to proliferate (multiply rapidly).""  Accordingly, the passage indicates that once Manutius introduced it, the typographical innovation of the semicolon was quickly embraced by others.
(Choices B and D)  He undervalued traditional punctuation marks like the colon; and He invented a new punctuation mark, rendering older marks obsolete.  As Paragraph 4 relays, ""Aldus Manutius…first contrived (engineered) to wed the comma with the colon to invent the semicolon in 1494.""  However, while Manutius did invent a new punctuation mark, the semicolon, the passage never indicates that he was motivated to do so because he placed less value on traditional punctuation marks, such as the colon, than other printers did, or even that he favored this new mark over the older ones.  The passage also never suggests that by introducing the semicolon, Manutius caused any existing punctuation marks, such as colons and commas, to become obsolete."
"302","Cecelia Watson describes the fifteenth-century literati as ""testing-out and tinkering-with"" punctuation (Paragraph 4).  Based on this information, it can most reasonably be assumed that Manutius' predecessors:","C","54","It was Italian humanist and printer extraordinaire Aldus Manutius who first contrived to wed the comma with the colon to invent the semicolon in 1494.  This feat capped what Cecelia Watson has characterized as a time ""of writerly experimentation and invention""—a time ""when there were no punctuation rules,"" only a protracted ""testing-out and tinkering-with of punctuation by the fifteenth-century literati"" as they struggled to communicate the subtleties of their ideas and express their voices in print….  With Manutius—who also introduced the italic font and gave the comma its distinctive contours—punctuation came of age, moving from a matter of the author's discretion to a matter of rules as society progressed from oral recitation to silent reading. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, punctuation took a long time to evolve and become standardized.  In particular, Cecelia Watson represents the period before Aldus Manutius invented the semicolon as a ""time 'of writerly experimentation and invention…when there were no punctuation rules.'""  Instead, there was what Watson calls ""a protracted 'testing-out and tinkering-with of punctuation by the fifteenth-century literati (ie, educated people interested in art and literature)' as they struggled to communicate the subtleties of their ideas and express their voices in print.""  However, after Manutius—who also introduced italics and shaped the comma—""punctuation came of age, moving from a matter of the author's discretion to a matter of rules.""
In relaying Watson's claim that Manutius' predecessors had been ""testing-out and tinkering-with"" punctuation, the passage indicates that these individuals had been experimenting with different ways to use punctuation more effectively.  As Paragraph 4 also notes, rather than establishing rules for usage, these predecessors would often leave punctuation decisions up to individual writers who were trying out different uses.  Therefore, Watson's claim that the fifteenth-century literati were ""'testing-out and tinkering-with'"" (Paragraph 4) punctuation most likely means that Manutius' predecessors had not fully determined some of the functions of punctuation.
 By contrast, based on Watson's description of the fifteenth-century literati as ""'testing-out and tinkering-with'"" punctuation (Paragraph 4), it would not be most reasonable to assume that Manutius' predecessors:
had not desired to convey the nuances of sense and style (Choice A).  In her description, Watson specifies how these literati ""struggled to communicate the subtleties of their ideas and express their voices in print.""  Consequently, it is likely that the predecessors of Manutius did desire to convey the nuances of sense and style.  Furthermore, the fact that these struggles came to an end when Manutius' standardized punctuation—which allowed it to become ""the handmaid of syntax, purveying (providing) sense along with style""—would reinforce such a conclusion.
had not considered punctuation to be an important matter (Choice B).  Watson's description of a ""protracted"" period of ""testing-out and tinkering-with"" reveals that Manutius' predecessors expended considerable effort in experimenting with punctuation.  Such effort would indicate that these predecessors most likely considered punctuation an important matter.
had not been concerned with innovation in punctuation (Choice D).   Before noting the ""protracted"" struggle with punctuation carried out by the ""literati"" of the fifteenth century, Watson characterizes the time period as one ""of writerly experimentation and invention.""  This characterization stresses that at least some of Manutius' predecessors were trying out different ways to use punctuation and possibly inventing new marks, thereby revealing a concern with innovation."
"303","What function is performed in the passage by Truss' claim that employing a semicolon can represent a compliment from the author to the reader (Paragraph 3)?","D","54","For all its purported deficiencies and disadvantages, the semicolon came to boast sundry useful functions.  Perhaps the most indisputable of these is the ability to effectively organize items in a sentence otherwise cluttered with too many commas.  As a versatile mark of myriad possibilities, the semicolon was enthusiastically embraced by the likes of George Bernard Shaw and Virginia Woolf; the latter used them idiosyncratically to stitch disparate grammatical structures into paragraph-long sentences.  In Truss' opinion, employing a semicolon represents one of the highest compliments a writer can pay her readership, as if to say that the perspicacious reader is eminently capable of deciphering authorial innuendo.  More subtle than a period, more substantive than a comma, the semicolon breeds nuance, hinting at hermeneutical depths. (Paragraph 3)
After referencing the ""purported (supposed) deficiencies and disadvantages"" of semicolon use, Paragraph 3 introduces some of the mark's potential advantages, or ""sundry (various) useful functions.""  These functions notably include ""the ability to effectively organize items in a sentence otherwise cluttered with too many commas"" and the ability ""to stitch disparate grammatical structures into paragraph-long sentences.""  The author then presents Truss' claim that ""employing a semicolon represents one of the highest compliments a writer can pay her readership"" because it seems to say that an astute reader is ""eminently capable of deciphering authorial innuendo (ie, suggestion or hint from the author).""
Consequently, use of the semicolon requires the reader to think about the author's meaning in nuanced ways.  This use creates a complex effect on the reader, and the writer, in turn, honors the reader's intelligence by creating this effect through semicolon usage.  Therefore, Truss' claim functions in the passage to reveal a potentially complex effect of semicolon use on the reader.
 By contrast, none of the following represents the function of Truss' claim in the passage:
It discredits the notion that semicolons are a cause of confusion (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 1, the use of the semicolon can ""[sow] the seeds of semantic confusion (ie, confusion about the meaning of words).""  Later, Paragraph 3 conveys Truss' opinion that a semicolon represents a compliment by the writer to the reader who ""is eminently capable of deciphering authorial innuendo.""  That the reader needs to decipher what the author has written and punctuated with semicolons reinforces the notion that the punctuation mark is often associated with some confusion or ambiguity about meaning.  Consequently, Truss' claim does not deny that semicolons can be a cause of confusion.
It highlights a widely acknowledged justification for extensive semicolon use (Choice B).  Paragraph 3 presents Truss' view that ""employing a semicolon represents one of the highest compliments a writer can pay her readership.""  However, the passage never suggests that this sentiment about semicolon usage is shared by others, nor does it indicate what the popularly accepted opinion about, let alone justification, for extensive semicolon use might be.
It establishes that semicolons can help writers to attract readers (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 3, ""In Truss' opinion, employing a semicolon represents one of the highest compliments a writer can pay her readership"" because it seems to say that ""the perspicacious reader is eminently capable of deciphering authorial innuendo.""  However, whether or not authors are actually flattering readers through semicolon use, Truss' claim does not imply that authors try to attract readers by using semicolons, nor that readers are attracted to texts that feature an abundance of semicolons."
"304","Suppose it were discovered that starvation during the final months of pregnancy resulted in children who were smaller than average even as adults.  How would this new information affect the passage claim about intrauterine deprivation and adult obesity?","B","55","The initial results, published in 1976, revealed that, among other health consequences, individuals exposed to deprivation during early gestation had much higher than normal rates of obesity as adults.  Research by scientists from both the Netherlands and the US, together with new information from the field of epigenetics…, now suggests that nutritional restriction during early gestation effectively inactivates specific genes. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, the initial results of the Dutch Hunger Winter Study, which compared the Hunger Winter babies with their unaffected siblings, ""revealed that…individuals exposed to deprivation during early gestation had much higher than normal rates of obesity as adults.""  However, the new information that starvation during the last months of pregnancy (ie, late gestation) resulted in children who were smaller than average even as adults has no bearing on what occurs earlier in gestation.  Therefore, this new information would not affect the passage claim about early intrauterine deprivation and adult obesity.
(Choices A, C, and D)  The new information that starvation during the last months of pregnancy resulted in children who were smaller than average even as adults is irrelevant to the passage claim about early intrauterine deprivation leading to adult obesity.  Therefore, this new information would neither strengthen (support) nor falsify (refute) that claim.  In addition, because it is irrelevant, this information would not demonstrate that the passage claim needs to be reexamined."
"305","The Hunger Winter babies and their siblings had offspring who are now well into adulthood.  Based on the passage, being able to also study these offspring long-term was most useful to the epidemiologists because it allowed them to:","C","55","…[I]n individuals whose mothers suffered near-starvation during the early stages of pregnancy, DNA methylation silenced specific genes that normally help boost the rate at which the body consumes cellular energy.  The inactivation of these genes lowers metabolism, causing an increased tendency toward adult obesity. (Paragraph 4)
Furthermore, it has now been documented that the offspring of the Hunger Winter babies frequently exhibit the same health problems as their parents, including not only obesity, but also diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  Thus, with the advancement of genomics, this unfortunate period of starvation in the Netherlands offers strong evidence that DNA methylation is heritable…. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 4 explains that ""in individuals whose mothers suffered near-starvation during the early stages of pregnancy, DNA methylation silenced specific genes that normally help boost the rate at which the body consumes cellular energy,"" leading to ""an increased tendency toward adult obesity.""  Paragraph 5 then states that ""the offspring of the Hunger Winter babies frequently exhibit the same health problems as their parents,"" offering ""strong evidence that DNA methylation is heritable.""
These statements suggest that differences in methylation patterns are inherited and correlate with adult disease.  Consequently, the fact that the Hunger Winter babies and their siblings had offspring who are now well into adulthood was most useful to researchers because it enabled them to hypothesize that different health outcomes in the adult offspring correlate to the differences in their methylation patterns.
By contrast, none of the following statements represent the reason why being able to study the offspring long-term was most useful to epidemiologists:
estimate the offspring's likelihood of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in adulthood (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 5, ""it has now been documented that the offspring of the Hunger Winter babies frequently exhibit the same health problems as their parents, including not only obesity, but also diabetes and cardiovascular disease.""  However, this fact was established long after the Dutch Hunger Winter Study began, which means that the likelihood of adult disease was confirmed, not estimated or predicted.
determine the current methylation patterns of the offspring (Choice B).  If epidemiologists were to determine the current methylation patterns of the adult offspring, it would provide them with data.  However, such information about methylation patterns, which are believed to be heritable, is not useful in itself; rather, it becomes useful when researchers can correlate it with adult disease.
ascertain at which stages of the offspring's lives the effects of the methylation were most pronounced (Choice D).  The passage discusses the effects of methylation in the adult offspring of the Hunger Winter babies.  It also proposes that methylation patterns are heritable but does not discuss methylation's effects at different stages of the offspring's lives, nor suggest that at some stages they are more pronounced."
"306","From the discussion in Paragraph 3, one can reasonably conclude that prior to World War II, there were NO studies that:","D","55","The famine was among the best documented in modern history, and the Dutch Hunger Winter Study has been the first study to examine the long-term consequences of intrauterine starvation.  The study compared 422 individuals exposed to adverse intrauterine conditions with 463 siblings who were the products of pregnancies that either came to term before the famine began or occurred afterward. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 states that ""[t]he famine was among the best documented in modern history, and the Dutch Hunger Winter Study has been the first study to examine the long-term consequences of intrauterine starvation.""  One can therefore reasonably conclude that prior to this famine, or prior to World War II, there were no studies that examined the long-term (as opposed to the short-term) effects of nutritional deficiency before birth.
(Choices A and C)  Paragraph 3 states that ""[t]he famine was among the best documented in modern history.""  This implies that earlier famines had also been well documented or studied.  Such documentation would have provided information about the effects of starvation on particular population groups.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 3 says that the Dutch Hunger Winter Study ""compared 422 individuals exposed to adverse intrauterine conditions with 463 siblings who were the products of pregnancies that either came to term before the famine began or occurred afterward.""  However, the passage does not state whether there had been prior studies that compared children born during famine with those born before or after."
"307","The response to which of the following queries would be most relevant for assessing whether the Dutch Hunger Winter Study accurately measured the long-term health effects of intrauterine starvation?","D","55","However, the horror of the Dutch famine that occurred toward the end of the war, what in the Netherlands is commonly called the Hongerwinter, has provided epidemiologists a unique opportunity to research the long-term health effects of nutritional deficiency in utero on a specific cohort of individuals. (Paragraph 1)
The famine was among the best documented in modern history, and the Dutch Hunger Winter Study has been the first to examine the long-term consequences of intrauterine starvation.  The study compared 422 individuals exposed to adverse intrauterine conditions with 463 siblings who were the products of pregnancies that either came to term before the famine began or occurred afterward. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 1 says ""the Dutch famine…provided epidemiologists a unique opportunity to research long-term health effects of nutritional deficiency in utero on a specific cohort of individuals.""  Paragraph 3 also mentions that ""the Dutch Hunger Winter Study has been the first study to examine the long-term consequences of intrauterine starvation"" and ""compared 422 individuals exposed to adverse intrauterine conditions with 463 siblings who were the products of pregnancies"" that did not occur during the famine.  The study was therefore intended to measure the long-term health effects of intrauterine starvation, making this the research objective.
The answer to how much or to what degree the mothers were exposed to the famine is important (and the most relevant option) because it allows for assessment of whether the research objective of the study was measured accurately.  For example, if some mothers were exposed to the famine more than others, the mothers with more exposure would be presumed to have had babies with more severe long-term health effects.  Researchers would have to ask this question and get a satisfactory answer (ie, all mothers were exposed to similar degrees of starvation/famine) to ensure that the study was valid.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 3 says ""the study compared 422 individuals exposed to adverse intrauterine conditions with 463 siblings who were the products of pregnancies that either came to term before the famine began or occurred afterward.""  Whether other potential participants died prior to the study would not affect the study's research objective as it pertains to the already reported number of actual participants.
(Choice B)  According to Paragraph 1, the Dutch famine ""has provided epidemiologists a unique opportunity to study the long-term health effects of nutritional deficiency in utero on a specific cohort of individuals.""  Because the focus of the study is intrauterine starvation, information about whether the mothers of these individuals had starved at some time prior to the famine is not directly relevant to the study's research objective.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 3 states that the study participants were ""422 individuals exposed to adverse intrauterine conditions"" because of the famine, along with ""463 siblings"" who were not exposed.  As the country of origin of the participants would have had no bearing on this exposure, knowing what percentage of them were not native to the Netherlands is irrelevant to the study's research objective."
"308","Given the information in the passage, how might the Netherlands have escaped the German retribution?  The Dutch government could have:","A","55","The devastation began in September 1944 when Allied Airborne Forces failed to seize control of the bridge that crosses the Rhine at Arnhem.  To impede German ground troops and assist the Allies, the Dutch government then ordered a railway strike, prompting the Germans to retaliate with an embargo that cut off food and fuel supplies to the central and western provinces of the Netherlands, including the country's largest urban centers. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 explains how after the Allies' attempt to seize control of the bridge at Arnhem failed, ""the Dutch government ordered a railway strike, prompting the Germans to retaliate with an embargo that cut off food and fuel supplies to the central and western provinces of the Netherlands.""  Therefore, it was the railway strike that caused the Germans to retaliate.  Consequently, the Dutch could have escaped this retribution (retaliation or punishment) by the Germans if they had refrained from shutting down the railroad.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 2 refers to ""the German-occupied Netherlands"" and relates how a railway strike was ordered ""to impede German ground troops and assist the Allies"" after the Allies' attempt to take the bridge at Arnhem failed.  However, this is the sole example of Dutch resistance to the German forces mentioned in the passage.  Furthermore, the passage never suggests that resisting German occupation more fiercely would have enabled the Dutch to escape German retribution.  Moreover, the passage does not describe what fiercer resistance would have entailed.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 2 indicates that by imposing the railway strike, the Dutch were attempting to ""assist the Allies"" and ""impede German ground troops…, prompting the Germans to retaliate with an embargo.""  Consequently, for the Dutch, joining forces with the Allies actually prompted rather than prevented German retribution.
(Choice D)  The passage reports only that ""Allied Airborne Forces failed to seize control of the bridge that crosses the Rhine River at Arnhem"" (Paragraph 2).  There is no indication that the Dutch fought alongside the Allies for control of the bridge, or that had they done so, the results would have been different.  Rather, the passage describes only the Dutch government's decision to launch a railway strike and the German retribution for this act."
"309","Which of the following passage assertions is the most essential for readers to accept in order for them to find the author's argument reasonable?","D","56","Although airplanes and automobiles have now assumed greater prominence, the time has arrived for the resurgence of railroads.  A revitalized and advanced railway system would confer numerous essential benefits on both the United States and the globe. (Paragraph 2)
In a sense these two obstacles are one, as American dependence on personal automobiles is partially due to the paucity of rapid public transportation. (Paragraph 3)
A high-speed passenger rail system would dramatically transform American life as travel between cities and states became quicker and more convenient, encouraging commerce, business, and tourism.  Such a system would also make important strides in environmental preservation.  According to a 2007 British study, ""CO2 emissions from aircraft operations are...at least five times greater"" than those from high-speed trains. (Paragraph 4)
We should thus move ahead with confidence that the rewards will outweigh the expenditure as citizens increasingly choose to travel by train.  Both for society's gain and the crucial well-being of the planet, our path forward should proceed upon rails. (Paragraph 5)
The author's argument is that America should build a high-speed rail system because doing so would grant ""numerous essential benefits on both the United States and the globe"" (Paragraph 2).  These benefits include ""encouraging commerce, business, and tourism"" as well as making ""important strides in environmental preservation"" (Paragraph 4).  However, those benefits would occur only if the public is willing to use high-speed rail as a frequent mode of transportation.
The author suggests that this willingness exists.  For instance, Paragraph 3 states that ""American dependence on personal automobiles is partially due to the paucity (lack) of rapid public transportation,"" implying that Americans would use such transportation if they had access to it.  Likewise, Paragraph 5 makes this point more explicitly by asserting that ""the rewards [of high-speed rail] will outweigh the expenditure as citizens increasingly choose to travel by train.""
Nevertheless, if American citizens continued to depend mostly on airplanes and cars even with high-speed trains available, then such trains would not actually provide the benefits that the author envisions.  Consequently, for readers to find the author's argument reasonable, it is most essential for them to accept the assertion that the public would readily adopt high-speed rail travel if it were available.
 (Choice A)  The airline and car industries have undue influence over American travel.  Paragraph 2 states that ""airplanes and automobiles have now assumed greater prominence"" compared to trains in America, and Paragraph 3 cites ""the current dominance of the automobile"" as an obstacle to support for high-speed trains.  Accordingly, the author would likely agree that the airline and car industries have undue influence over American travel.  However, his or her argument depends more crucially on the idea that those industries' influence is caused by ""the paucity of rapid public transportation"" (Paragraph 3), and thus that the public would readily adopt high-speed rail travel if it were available.
(Choice B)  A high-speed railroad network would encourage economic activity.  According to Paragraph 4, ""A high-speed passenger rail system would dramatically transform American life…encouraging commerce, business, and tourism.""  However, these economic benefits (as well as any environmental ones) could only be realized if citizens choose to embrace this mode of transportation.  Therefore, the assertion that a high-speed railroad network would encourage economic activity is less essential to the author's argument than the idea that the public would adopt high-speed rail travel once it is available.
(Choice C)  The superiority of foreign railroads disadvantages America in international trade.  Paragraph 3 states that ""[t]he railroads of Europe and Japan…have vastly outpaced their American counterparts.""  Although this statement indicates that foreign railroads are superior to those in America, the author's argument is not based on the idea that building high-speed railroads would improve America's international trade.  Rather, the author claims that ""travel between [American] cities and states would become quicker and more convenient"" and that such railroads would ""make important strides in environmental preservation"" (Paragraph 4)."
"310","Which of the following is most like the relationship between American railroads and British railroads as they are described in the passage?","A","56","Locomotives were invented in England, with the first major railroad connecting Liverpool and Manchester in 1830.  However, it was in America that railroads would be put to the greatest use in the nineteenth century. (Paragraph 1)
While that speed was achieved under tightly controlled conditions, it still speaks to the great disparity in railroad development between the United States and other countries since the mid-twentieth century.  British trains travel at speeds much higher than those in America, where both the trains themselves and the infrastructure to support them have simply been allowed to fall behind. (Paragraph 3)
According to the passage, the first American trains overshadowed their British counterparts, but in modern times British trains are superior.  For instance, Paragraph 1 conveys that although ""[l]ocomotives were invented in England…it was in America that railroads would be put to the greatest use in the nineteenth century.""  Paragraph 3 then explains that there has been a ""great disparity in railroad development between the United States and other countries since the mid-twentieth century.""  In particular, ""British trains travel at speeds much higher than those in America, where both the trains themselves and the infrastructure to support them have simply been allowed to fall behind.""
Therefore, this relationship is most analogous to a situation in which an apprentice artist surpasses a master's early works but does not live up to the master's later works.  Like the British railroads, the original artist (the master) was first surpassed, but his later works re-established his superior position.
 By contrast, none of the following situations is most analogous to the relationship between American railroads and British railroads, because they do not include a re-established superiority:
A financial investor earns large sums of money in the short term but loses a larger amount over time (Choice B).  There is no suggestion in this analogy that such an investor later recoups her losses.  Moreover, her situation is not described in relation to another entity that surpasses her.
A rookie athlete sets a team record but in later seasons his record is broken by a newer player (Choice C).  In the scenario described, the rookie's record is later broken by a newer player, not by the previous record holder.  Accordingly, while the newer player sets a superior record, he does not re-establish his superiority.
An investigative journalist races to break a story but is beaten to the punch by a rival network (Choice D).  There is no suggestion in this analogy that the journalist later beats the rival network to the punch on other stories."
"311","For which of the following passage claims does the author provide supporting evidence?","D","56","A high-speed passenger rail system would dramatically transform American life as travel between cities and states became quicker and more convenient, encouraging commerce, business, and tourism.  Such a system would also make important strides in environmental preservation.  According to a 2007 British study, ""CO2 emissions from aircraft operations are...at least five times greater"" than those from high-speed trains.  For similar reasons, Osaka, Japan, was ranked as ""the best…green transportation city in Asia"" by the 2011 Green City Index.  As Lee-in Chen Chiu notes in The Kyoto Economic Review, Osakans travel by railway more than twice as much as they travel by car. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 states that a high-speed rail system would ""make important strides in environmental preservation.""  The author then supports this claim with data comparing the environmental effects of rail travel to those of travel by airplane or automobile: ""According to a 2007 British study, 'CO2 emissions from aircraft operations are...at least five times greater' than those from high-speed trains.""  Similarly, ""Osaka, Japan, was ranked as 'the best…green transportation city in Asia' by the 2011 Green City Index,"" and ""Osakans travel by railway more than twice as much as they travel by car.""
Therefore, the author provides supporting evidence for the claim that increasing the use of high-speed railroads would be beneficial for the environment.
 By contrast, the author provides no supporting evidence for the following claims:
Developing a countrywide high-speed rail system would come with significant costs (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 5, ""developing a countrywide high-speed rail system would come with significant costs.""  However, the author makes this assertion without providing any specific information regarding such costs.
A high-speed passenger rail system would dramatically transform American life (Choice B).  Paragraph 4 states that ""[a] high-speed passenger rail system would dramatically transform American life as travel between cities and states became quicker and more convenient, encouraging commerce, business, and tourism.""  However, the author provides no data to support the idea that such a transformation would occur.
The United States still has the largest railroad network in the world (Choice C).  Paragraph 1 states that ""[b]y 1887 there were nearly 164,000 miles of railroad tracks in America, and by 1916 that number had swelled to over 254,000.""  Paragraph 2 then asserts that ""the United States still has the largest railroad network in the world.""  However, this assertion is not supported by evidence because the author does not provide the current total mileage of railroad tracks in America nor compare that number to the mileage of other countries' railroad networks."
"312","How would the author's argument be impacted if studies suggest there is an increasing trend of people using ride-sharing services for transportation?","C","56","The chief obstacles to garnering support for such a project are the current dominance of the automobile and the languishing technology of existing railroads.  In a sense these two obstacles are one, as American dependence on personal automobiles is partially due to the paucity of rapid public transportation.  The railroads of Europe and Japan, by comparison, have vastly outpaced their American counterparts. (Paragraph 3)
We should thus move ahead with confidence that the rewards will outweigh the expenditure as citizens increasingly choose to travel by train. (Paragraph 5)
Part of the author's argument is that Americans would use more public transportation if it were feasible, but they are often forced to depend on vehicle ownership out of necessity.  For example, Paragraph 3 connects the ""current dominance of the automobile"" in American life to the ""languishing (neglected or weakened) technology of existing railroads,"" and asserts that ""American dependence on personal automobiles is partially due to the paucity (lack) of rapid public transportation.""  Similarly, in Paragraph 5 the author asserts that if a high-speed rail network were built, ""citizens [would] increasingly choose to travel by train,"" which would reduce the need for them to own cars.
Thus, if there is an increasing trend of people using ride-sharing services for transportation, this trend would indicate that people are moving away from depending on their own vehicles for travel.  Accordingly, such a trend would support the author's assumption that the public could be willing to depend less on vehicle ownership.
 (Choice A)  It would refute the author's suggestion that trains would help fill a transportational need.  The author advocates high-speed rail as a way to address ""the paucity of rapid public transportation"" (Paragraph 3) in America.  In addition, he or she implies that such a rail system would help take the place of air travel, noting that ""'CO2 emissions from aircraft operations are…at least five times greater' than those from high-speed trains"" (Paragraph 4).  Thus, a trend toward increased use of ride-sharing services suggests a need for additional transportation options which trains might also help to fill.  Moreover, ride-sharing is unlikely to replace air travel as the author suggests high-speed rail might do.  Therefore, an increasing trend of people using ride-sharing services for transportation would not refute the idea that trains would help fill a transportational need.
(Choice B)  It would weaken the author's comparison between the Transcontinental Railroad and high-speed rail.  According to Paragraph 5, ""developing a countrywide high-speed rail system would come with significant costs.  However, that was also true of the original Transcontinental Railroad, as indeed it is with virtually any great project undertaken for the public good.""  Therefore, the author compares the Transcontinental Railroad and modern high-speed rail as ambitious but costly projects designed for society's benefit.  The basis for this comparison is not affected by an increase in the number of people using ride-sharing services.
(Choice D)  It would reinforce the author's claim that automobiles have made public transportation less important.  Paragraph 3 states that ""American dependence on personal automobiles is partially due to the paucity of rapid public transportation.""  Accordingly, the author argues that there is a lack of effective public transportation in America, to which the predominance of automobiles is a response.  However, he or she does not claim that automobiles have made public transportation less important."
"313","In the context of the passage, which of the following best explains Zoellner's claim that ""[u]nder the skin of modernity lies a skeleton of railroad tracks""?","D","56","While the United States still has the largest railroad network in the world, it operates largely in the background of American life, and citizens no longer view trains with the sense of importance those machines once commanded.  Nevertheless, the economic and industrial advantages those citizens enjoy today would not have been possible without America's history of trains; as Tom Zoellner reminds us, ""Under the skin of modernity lies a skeleton of railroad tracks."" (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, American citizens ""no longer view trains with the sense of importance those machines once commanded.""  However, the author points out that ""the economic and industrial advantages those citizens enjoy today would not have been possible without America's history of trains; as Tom Zoellner reminds us, 'Under the skin of modernity lies a skeleton of railroad tracks.'""  Therefore, the passage presents Zoellner's quote as an elaboration of the idea that America's past use of railroads was essential to producing the country's modern way of life.
Consequently, in the context of the passage, Zoellner's claim indicates that American trains have been crucial in producing the country as we know it.
 By contrast, in the context of the passage, Zoellner's claim does not indicate that:
American trains now represent an obsolete technology (Choice A).  Paragraph 3 states that ""in America…both the trains themselves and the infrastructure to support them have simply been allowed to fall behind,"" which suggests that to some extent American trains represent an obsolete technology.  However, the passage does not connect Zoellner's quote to that idea, but instead to the claim that the advantages of modern society ""would not have been possible without America's history of trains"" (Paragraph 2).
American trains have been overshadowed by other forms of transportation (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 2, ""airplanes and automobiles have now assumed greater prominence"" in America.  However, Zoellner's quote is used to indicate the past role of railroads in producing ""the economic and industrial advantages [American] citizens enjoy today.""  The passage does not connect Zoellner's quote to the idea that trains have been overshadowed.
American trains have been largely retired from use in current society (Choice C).  According to the passage, ""the United States still has the largest railroad network in the world,"" even though ""it operates largely in the background of American life"" (Paragraph 2)."
"314","Of the following passage claims, which could most easily be confirmed or refuted?","B","56","The railroads of Europe and Japan, by comparison, have vastly outpaced their American counterparts.  Japan has operated high-speed rail lines continuously since 1964, and in 2007, a French train set a record of 357 miles per hour….  British trains travel at speeds much higher than those in America, where both the trains themselves and the infrastructure to support them have simply been allowed to fall behind.  In much of Europe it is common for trains to travel at close to 200 miles per hour. (Paragraph 3)
One of the author's points in arguing for a high-speed rail system in America is that trains in other countries are now much more advanced.  According to Paragraph 3, ""[t]he railroads of Europe and Japan…have vastly outpaced their American counterparts.""  For example, ""Japan has operated high-speed rail lines continuously since 1964, and in 2007, a French train set a record of 357 miles per hour.""  Meanwhile, in America, ""both the trains themselves and the infrastructure to support them have simply been allowed to fall behind.  In much of Europe it is common for trains to travel at close to 200 miles per hour.""
These comparisons between the trains of America and those of Europe and Japan are based on currently existing, measurable data points concerning factors such as speed and years of operation.  Accordingly, the claim that the railroads of Europe and Japan have vastly outpaced their American counterparts could most easily be confirmed or refuted.
 (Choice A)  Americans no longer view trains with the sense of importance they once commanded.  Although it could be true that American citizens ""no longer view trains with the sense of importance those machines once commanded"" (Paragraph 2), it is difficult to directly confirm or refute such a general claim about people's views and opinions.
(Choice C)  An advanced railway system would benefit America economically.  The author asserts that an advanced railway system would promote ""commerce, business, and tourism"" (Paragraph 4).  However, that claim is a projection rather than something which can be measured at present.  Accordingly, it is difficult to confirm or refute whether an advanced railway system would in fact benefit America economically as the author claims.
(Choice D)  A high-speed passenger rail system would dramatically transform American life.  The author claims that ""[a] high-speed passenger rail system would dramatically transform American life as travel between cities and states became quicker and more convenient, encouraging commerce, business, and tourism"" (Paragraph 4).  However, this claim concerns what the author expects to occur in the future, which cannot be directly confirmed or refuted in the present."
"315","Which of the following statements, if true, would most challenge the author's argument for the value of building a high speed rail system in America?","D","56","Although airplanes and automobiles have now assumed greater prominence, the time has arrived for the resurgence of railroads.  A revitalized and advanced railway system would confer numerous essential benefits on both the United States and the globe. (Paragraph 2)
We should thus move ahead with confidence that the rewards will outweigh the expenditure as citizens increasingly choose to travel by train.  Both for society's gain and the crucial well-being of the planet, our path forward should proceed upon rails. (Paragraph 5)
One of the author's main reasons for advocating the construction of high-speed rail is that this mode of transportation is environmentally conscious.  For example, in Paragraph 2 the author states that ""[a] revitalized and advanced railway system would confer (grant) numerous essential benefits on both the United States and the globe.""  Likewise, he or she concludes by stating that ""for society's gain and the crucial well-being of the planet, our path forward should proceed upon rails"" (Paragraph 5).
Accordingly, the author's argument for the value of building a high-speed rail system in America depends heavily on the idea that such a system would benefit the environment.  However, if the process of constructing high-speed rail could affect the environment in unpredictable ways, that would raise the possibility that such construction could cause negative environmental effects, not just the positive ones that the author describes.  As that possibility could undercut the author's justification for building a high-speed rail system, the author's argument would be most challenged if that claim were true.
 (Choice A)  On average, the distance between travel destinations is shorter in Europe than it is in America.  The author advocates high-speed rail in part because ""'CO2 emissions from aircraft operations are...at least five times greater' than those from high-speed trains"" (Paragraph 4).  This comparison implies that high-speed rail transportation can replace air travel, which typically covers long distances.  Therefore, if the average distance between travel destinations is shorter in Europe than it is in America, that fact would reinforce the idea that America would benefit from a high-speed rail system.
(Choice B)  The slower speeds of trains in America compared to those in Europe are due to safety issues with American trains.  Paragraph 3 states that ""in America…both the trains themselves and the infrastructure to support them have simply been allowed to fall behind,"" whereas ""[i]n much of Europe it is common for trains to travel at close to 200 miles per hour.""  Accordingly, if American trains are unable to safely match the speed of European trains, this fact would be consistent with the author's descriptions of American and European trains.  Thus, safety concerns about American trains would support the author's argument that America's railways should be updated to match their faster and safer European counterparts.
(Choice C)  The primary use of existing American trains is the transport of freight rather than passengers.  The author argues that ""[a] high-speed passenger rail system would dramatically transform American life as travel between cities and states became quicker and more convenient, encouraging commerce, business, and tourism"" (Paragraph 4).  If the primary use of existing American trains is the transport of freight rather than passengers, that fact would suggest a current lack of passenger trains.  Therefore, this statement would likely support rather than challenge the author's argument about the value of building a high-speed rail system in America."
"316","The author claims that financial regulatory reform is necessary to:","C","57","Preceding the Great Crash, the financial market was already unstable, which in hindsight has proven to be one of the many warning signs for emerging crises.  Regrettably, these ""red flags"" were not characterized until after the collapse.  To prevent another crash as experienced in 1929 and, to a lesser extent in 2008, changes must be made as financial markets expand and become more intricate. (Paragraph 3)
Regulation is needed for remedying market failure and protecting the economy from an imminent collapse. (Paragraph 5)
Without safeguards in place, the American financial market will face a continuous ebb and flow of prosperity and may be forced to face another crisis. (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 3 mentions the ""many warning signs for emerging crises"" that, in hindsight, were identified as preceding the Great Crash of 1929.  Based on these warning signs, the author states: ""To prevent another crash as experienced in 1929 and, to a lesser extent in 2008, changes must be made as financial markets expand and become more intricate.""
Similarly, Paragraph 5 states that ""regulation is needed for…protecting the economy from an imminent collapse,"" and Paragraph 6 states that ""[w]ithout safeguards in place, the American financial market…may be forced to face another crisis.""  Therefore, the author stresses that financial regulatory reform is necessary to prevent another economic crisis like the Great Crash of 1929.

(Choice A)  ensure that public assets are protected after the next stock market crash.  Paragraph 5 conveys that ""[r]egulation is needed for…protecting the economy from an imminent collapse.""  Therefore, the goal of such regulation is to prevent another possible collapse, not to deal with the aftermath of another stock market crash (ie, protection of public assets after the crisis).
(Choice B)  protect citizens with a stake in the financial market from detrimental Congressional laws.  According to Paragraph 4, ""A January 2009 report from the Comptroller General's Office to the United States Congress was delivered in hopes of shaping potential regulatory reform efforts.""  Paragraph 5 then asserts that ""there must be a broad political mandate in support of serious financial regulatory reforms…for remedying market failure and protecting the economy from an imminent collapse.""  Therefore, the author suggests that Congressional laws could shape reform efforts to protect citizens from a potential market collapse; he or she does not argue that such reform efforts would protect citizens from Congressional laws.
(Choice D)  shield complex and intricate investments from the hands of monetary elites.  The author is critical of the fact that ""[f]or too long, monetary elites such as lobbyists, private bankers, and commercial investors have controlled a potentially fragile financial system"" (Paragraph 5).  However, he or she does not discuss shielding investments from such elites, but rather states specifically that ""[r]egulation is needed for remedying market failure and protecting the economy from an imminent collapse."""
"317","Someone who opposed John Maynard Keynes' and Hyman Minsky's theories would most likely support:","D","57","In the late 1930s, as experts clamored to unravel the source of this financial disaster, British economist John Maynard Keynes organized a dynamic revolution in neoclassical macroeconomics, purporting that free markets could ultimately lead to more adequate employment, rather than the normative ""boom and bust"" cycle of fiscal recessions and depressions in the United States….  The American economics professor Hyman Minsky joined the Keynesian cause two decades later, adding that an accumulation of debt by the national government drives an unstable economy toward crisis, especially in the nongovernment sector. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, ""In the late 1930s…British economist John Maynard Keynes organized a dynamic revolution in neoclassical macroeconomics,"" advocating for ""free markets…rather than the normative 'boom and bust' cycle of fiscal recessions and depressions in the United States.""  The author adds that ""[t]he American economics professor Hyman Minsky joined the Keynesian cause two decades later.""  Hence, someone who opposed Keynes and Minsky's theories would most likely argue against their recommendations and instead support keeping regulations status quo, tolerating the ""boom and bust"" cycle as the economic norm.
 By contrast, all of the following ideas are endorsed by Keynes and Minsky.  Therefore, they would not be supported by an opponent of those economists' theories:
the organization of neoclassical macroeconomics into a system with adequate employment (Choice A).  Paragraph 2 states that ""Keynes organized a dynamic revolution in neoclassical macroeconomics, purporting that free markets could ultimately lead to more adequate employment.""  Since Keynes championed this principle, an opponent of Keynes' theories would not agree with it.
the idea that an accumulation of debt promotes an unhealthy national economy (Choice B).  Paragraph 2 describes Minsky's claim that ""an accumulation of debt by the national government drives an unstable economy toward crisis.""  Therefore, an opponent of Minsky's theories would likely disagree, rejecting the idea that debt accumulation leads to an unhealthy national economy.
shifting financial responsibility toward consumers rather than the government (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 3, ""Keynesian economics points to a macroeconomic system wherein a 'mixed economy' places the bulk of financial responsibility on households, to be supplemented by governmental spending when necessary.""  Accordingly, Keynes advocates for financial responsibility to primarily fall upon consumers, with government spending being introduced only when needed to address a problem.  An opponent of Keynes' theories would not support such a shift."
"318","The author would be most likely to agree that Congress should take which of the following actions after receiving the January 2009 Comptroller General's Office report?","B","57","Preceding the Great Crash, the financial market was already unstable, which in hindsight has proven to be one of the many warning signs for emerging crises.  Regrettably, these ""red flags"" were not characterized until after the collapse.  To prevent another crash as experienced in 1929 and, to a lesser extent in 2008, changes must be made as financial markets expand and become more intricate. (Paragraph 3)
Progress has been made toward overall reform, however slowly.  A January 2009 report from the Comptroller General's Office to the United States Congress was delivered in hopes of shaping potential regulatory reform efforts. (Paragraph 4)
In Paragraph 3, the author mentions the ""many warning signs for emerging crises"" that preceded the Great Crash of 1929, noting that ""[r]egrettably, these 'red flags' were not characterized until after the collapse.""  The author asserts that steps must be taken today to ensure that no similar financial crisis occurs: ""To prevent another crash as experienced in 1929 and, to a lesser extent in 2008, changes must be made as financial markets expand and become more intricate.""  Accordingly, the author supports changes to the current financial environment in order to protect markets from potential collapse.
Paragraph 4 then describes the January 2009 congressional report, which was delivered ""in hopes of shaping potential regulatory reform efforts"" and to ""present an evaluation framework that can be used by Congress and others"" to guide such changes.  Similarly, Paragraph 5 states that ""there must be a broad political mandate in support of serious financial regulatory reforms.""  Consequently, the author would be most likely to agree that after receiving the report, Congress should create a committee for the evaluation of regulatory reform proposals.

(Choice A)  Maintain current arrangements of federal and state regulations.  The Comptroller General's Office report ""was delivered in hopes of shaping potential regulatory reform efforts"" (Paragraph 4).  The author expresses support for this goal, remarking that ""there must be a broad political mandate in support of serious financial regulatory reforms"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, the author believes that financial regulations need to be changed; he or she would not agree with maintaining those regulations' current arrangements.
(Choice C)  Tightly regulate mergers and other financial acquisitions.  According to Paragraph 4, the Comptroller General's report is meant to ""describe how regulation has evolved in banking, securities, thrifts, credit unions, futures, insurance, secondary mortgage markets and other important areas…and…present an evaluation framework that can be used by Congress and others to restructure regulatory reform.""  Accordingly, although regulating mergers and other financial acquisitions would likely be included in such reforms, that would represent only part of what the report describes.  Hence, the author would most likely recommend that Congress evaluate reform proposals in a broader sense which includes all subjects discussed in the report.
(Choice D)  Hire government officials who oppose the theories of Keynes and Minsky.  According to Paragraph 3, ""Many economists agree that the mainstream theory of financial markets, which is the foundation of support for the archaic New Financial Architecture (NFA), must be replaced by the realistic economic theories proposed by Keynes and Minsky.""  By calling Keynes' and Minsky's theories a ""realistic"" replacement for the ""archaic"" current system, the author implies that he or she supports those theories.  Therefore, the author would probably not suggest that Congress hire government officials who oppose the theories of Keynes and Minsky."
"319","Based on information in the passage, it can most reasonably be concluded that the current financial market has been influenced by:","C","57","These conjectures are meant to replace fragmented and complex arrangements of federal and state regulations—put into place over the past 150 years—that have not kept pace with major developments in financial markets and commercial products in recent decades.  Without safeguards in place, the American financial market will face a continuous ebb and flow of prosperity and may be forced to face another crisis. (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 6, the issue with current ""fragmented and complex arrangements of federal and state regulations"" is that these regulations ""have not kept pace with major developments in financial markets and commercial products in recent decades.""  Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the current financial market has been influenced by past major developments in the financial sector.
 (Choice A)  the Congressional response to regulatory reform efforts.  Paragraph 4 states that ""[a] January 2009 report from the Comptroller General's Office to the United States Congress was delivered in hopes of shaping potential regulatory reform.""  However, the passage never discusses whether Congress took action as a result of that report.  Consequently, it cannot be assumed that there was a Congressional response to regulatory reform efforts that influenced the current market.
(Choice B)  the sheer volume of financial products available.  Paragraph 6 mentions ""major developments in financial markets and commercial products in recent decades.""  However, no information is given about the volume of products available or whether this volume affects the current financial market.
(Choice D)  innovative changes in banking and insurance regulation.  According to Paragraph 4, a ""January 2009 report"" describes ""'significant limitations and gaps in the existing regulatory system.'""  Similarly, Paragraph 6 conveys that financial regulations ""have not kept pace with major developments in financial markets and commercial products in recent decades.""  Therefore, passage information suggests that banking and insurance regulation has become outdated, not that such regulation has seen innovative changes."
"320","Based on the passage, a Keynesian economist would recommend which of the following as an acceptable response during an economic crisis?","B","57","Keynes also supported government interference, contending that a reduction in consumer spending due to economic hardship must be adequately supplemented by government expenditure. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, ""Keynes…supported government interference, contending that a reduction in consumer spending due to economic hardship must be adequately supplemented by government expenditure.""  Therefore, Keynes would argue that during an economic crisis there should be an increase in governmental spending on consumer goods.
 (Choice A) An accumulation of secured debt by the national government.  Paragraph 2 mentions that ""American economist Hyman Minsky joined the Keynesian cause…adding that an accumulation of debt by the national government drives an unstable economy toward crisis.""  Accordingly, Keynesian economists would view accumulation of debt by the national government as potentially causing an economic crisis; thus, they would probably not recommend debt accumulation in response to such a crisis.
(Choice C)  A decrease in government-supplemented consumer expenditures.  According to the passage, ""Keynes…supported government interference, contending that a reduction in consumer spending due to economic hardship must be adequately supplemented by government expenditure"" (Paragraph 2).  Therefore, during an economic crisis (ie, a time of economic hardship) a Keynesian economist would most likely recommend an increase in government-supplemented consumer expenditures, not a decrease.
(Choice D)  A governmental shift to a free market economy.  Paragraph 2 describes Keynes' belief ""that free markets could ultimately lead to more adequate employment.""  However, Keynes ""also supported government interference, contending that a reduction in consumer spending due to economic hardship must be adequately supplemented by government expenditure.""  Therefore, although Keynesian economics supports free markets in general, it prescribes government intervention during economic downturns.  Consequently, during an economic crisis, a Keynesian economist would likely recommend greater government influence, rather than a shift toward free markets."
"321","If the ""ebb and flow of prosperity"" were truly an inescapable aspect of the American stock market, this notion would most challenge the claim that:","C","57","…Keynes organized a dynamic revolution in neoclassical macroeconomics, purporting that free markets could ultimately lead to more adequate employment, rather than the normative ""boom and bust"" cycle of fiscal recessions and depressions... (Paragraph 2)
These conjectures are meant to replace fragmented and complex arrangements of federal and state regulations—put into place over the past 150 years—that have not kept pace with major developments in financial markets and commercial products in recent decades.  Without safeguards in place, the American financial market will face a continuous ebb and flow of prosperity and may be forced to face another crisis. (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 2 describes a ""normative 'boom and bust' cycle of fiscal recessions and depressions in the United States,"" suggesting that the American stock market has always ebbed and flowed in cycles between times of prosperity and times of economic hardship.  If this ""ebb and flow of prosperity"" (Paragraph 6) were an inescapable aspect of the stock market, no amount of political policy or reform, positive or negative, could change the outcome: the cycle would always exist.  Therefore, the notion of this unavoidable cycle would challenge the idea that political mandates could be used to protect an extremely volatile financial system.
 (Choice A)  the implementation of a mixed economy would result in unbalanced consumer spending.  According to Paragraph 3, a mixed economy ""places the bulk of financial responsibility on households, to be supplemented by government spending when necessary.""  The author describes such an economy as a proposed replacement for ""the practice of…allowing the market to cycle in and out of recessions.""  However, if the ""ebb and flow"" of such market cycles were inescapable, attempting to prevent those cycles with a mixed economy would be ineffective, and could possibly have a detrimental effect.  Accordingly, such a situation would not challenge (and might support) the idea that implementing a mixed economy would result in unbalanced consumer spending.
(Choice B)  execution of financial reform proposals would eventually cause economic instability.  The passage suggests that ""serious financial regulatory reform"" (Paragraph 5) is necessary because ""[w]ithout safeguards in place, the American financial market will face a continuous ebb and flow of prosperity and may be forced to face another crisis"" (Paragraph 6).  However, if the ebb and flow of prosperity were inescapable, then such attempted reforms would be futile.  Therefore, this situation would not challenge (and could possibly support) the idea that attempting to execute such reform proposals could cause economic instability.
(Choice D)  government economists would be able to operate efficiently without regulatory safeguards.  Paragraph 6 asserts that ""[w]ithout safeguards in place, the American financial market will face a continuous ebb and flow of prosperity and may be forced to face another crisis.""  Hence, if the ebb and flow of prosperity were inescapable, then such safeguards would be pointless.  Accordingly, this situation would support, not challenge, the idea that government economists could operate efficiently without regulatory safeguards."
"322","The passage's main idea is that the figure of the Green Man","D","58","Chiefly, the Green Man symbolizes the union of humans and nature.  Indissolubly linked with the vegetative cycle and the agricultural year, he exudes vitality and fertility and signals both material and spiritual abundance.  Whether as the foliage-covered King of the May Day, also called Jack-in-the-Green, or as the King of the Harvest, John Barleycorn, the Green Man has been an indispensable element of traditional European village celebrations.  He is Keeper of the Forest as well as woodwose, the wild man of the woods, and is sometimes recognized as the consort of Mother Nature. (Paragraph 2)
The Green Man's lineage is multifaceted.  In the West he is a variant of Dionysus, the god of the vine who dies and is reborn….  In the East this mythic being manifests in the figure of Al-Khidir, the Verdant or Green One who is a spiritual guide of heroes in the Koran. (Paragraph 4)
Green Man figures also pervade Western literature, which was influenced at its origin by the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh and its character of Enkidu…. (Paragraph 5)
In Matthews' view, the Green Man is the embodiment of ""unvanquishable greenness.""  This perspective might explain the recurrence of his image and its recent adoption by environmental awareness movements as an assurance of ecological renewal. (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 2 states that ""the Green Man symbolizes the union of humans and nature.""  Paragraph 2 also cites the Green Man's connection with ""the vegetative cycle and the agricultural year,"" phenomena that have direct impact on humans.  In addition, according to Paragraph 2, the Green Man ""exudes (pours forth) vitality and fertility and signals both material and spiritual abundance.""  Furthermore, the Green Man image has been ""an indispensable element of the traditional European village celebrations"" of May Day and harvest time.
Paragraph 4 details ""the Green Man's lineage"" as ""multifaceted.""  Possible ancestries are traced through the religions of ancient peoples and include ""Dionysus, the god of the vine who dies and is reborn,"" and the Eastern Al-Khidir, ""the Verdant or Green One who is a spiritual guide of heroes in the Koran.""  Paragraph 5 discusses how ""Green Man figures also pervade Western literature.""
Finally, Paragraph 6 refers to the Green Man as ""the embodiment of 'unvanquishable greenness'"" and mentions that ""environmental awareness movements"" have adopted his image as ""an assurance of ecological renewal.""  Accordingly, this information shows that the passage's main idea is that the Green Man is a multifaceted symbol of the power of nature as it participates in human life.
By contrast, the main idea of the passage is not that the figure of the Green Man:
depicts the material and spiritual perception humans have of nature (Choice A).  Paragraph 2 claims that the mythic figure of the Green Man ""symbolizes the union of humans and nature"" and ""signals both material and spiritual abundance.""  However, the passage never specifically discusses the way in which humans perceive nature, spiritually or materially.
was inspired by the desire to facilitate agricultural productivity (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 2, the Green Man is ""[i]ndissolubly (inseparably) linked with the vegetative cycle and the agricultural year.""  Paragraph 2 also states that the Green Man ""exudes vitality and fertility and signals both material and spiritual abundance.""  However, the passage never suggests that the figure of the Green Man was inspired specifically by the desire of humans to facilitate agricultural productivity.
was a rare but significant presence in Western mythology (Choice C).  Paragraph 1 states that the Green Man is ""ubiquitous (present everywhere),"" indicating that the image is common, not rare, even if it can also be ""elusive (difficult to catch)."""
"323","The passage implies that the mythic figure of the Green Man emerged from:","C","58","The Green Man's lineage is multifaceted.  In the West he is a variant of Dionysus, the god of the vine who dies and is reborn.  Indeed, the fifth-century BCE statue of a leaf-clad Dionysus or Bacchus in Naples, Italy, is perhaps his oldest surviving image, although Dionysus may himself descend from the green-skinned Egyptian god Osiris who likewise dies and rises.  The Green Man is thought to be related to the rustic Greco-Roman deities Pan and Silvanus, and, more speculatively, to Cernunnos, the Celtic horned god of the hunt and lord of the animals.  In the East this mythic being manifests in the figure of Al-Khidir, the Verdant or Green One who is a spiritual guide of heroes in the Koran. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 discusses ""the Green Man's lineage (ancestry),"" calling it ""multifaceted.""  According to Paragraph 4, the Green Man ""is a variant of Dionysus, the god of the vine who dies and is reborn"" and may ""descend from the green-skinned Egyptian god Osiris.""  Paragraph 4 also states that the Green Man ""is thought to be related to the rustic Greco-Roman deities Pan and Silvanus, and, more speculatively, to Cernunnos, the Celtic horned god of the hunt and lord of the animals.""
Paragraph 4 further conveys that ""[i]n the East this mythic being manifests in the figure of Al-Khidir, the Verdant or Green One who is a spiritual guide of heroes in the Koran.""  Accordingly, the passage implies that the mythic figure of the Green Man emerged from ancient systems of worship and agricultural divinities.
By contrast, the passage does not imply that the mythic figure of the Green Man emerged from:
European church iconography(Choice A).  According to Paragraph 1, ""[a]mong [the Green Man's] most prominent images are the carved faces…that peer out from medieval church ceilings and walls.""  These types of images constitute ""neither a gargoyle nor a merely decorative motif, but an archetype (primordial or mythic image) whose history stretches…deeply into the mists of time and myth.""  Accordingly, this information indicates only that the church carvings represent an archetype with an extremely long history, not that this mythic figure emerged from these carvings.
rustic celebrations of nature when agricultural concerns dominated village life(Choice B).  Paragraph 2 states that ""the Green Man has been an indispensable element of traditional European village celebrations,"" particularly May Day and harvest time celebrations.  Therefore, this information conveys that the mythic figure of the Green Man was central to these rustic celebrations of nature when agricultural concerns dominated village life, but not that it emerged from these celebrations. 
heroic literary characters(Choice D).  According to Paragraph 5, ""Green Man figures…pervade Western literature, which was influenced at its origin by the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh and its character of Enkidu.""  Paragraph 5 then cites other examples of well-known heroic characters from literature that may represent versions of the Green Man, such as the Green Knight, Robin Hood, and Peter Pan.  Consequently, this information shows that the mythic figure of the Green Man appears in the form of these different heroic literary characters but not that it emerged from them."
"324","The author cites the term ""unvanquishable greenness"" (Paragraph 6) to indicate the capacity of nature:","A","58","Indissolubly linked with the vegetative cycle and the agricultural year, he exudes vitality and fertility and signals both material and spiritual abundance.  Whether as the foliage-covered King of the May Day…or as the King of the Harvest… the Green Man has been an indispensable element of traditional European village celebrations.  He is Keeper of the Forest as well as…the wild man of the woods, and…sometimes…the consort of Mother Nature. (Paragraph 2)
In Matthews' view, the Green Man is the embodiment of ""unvanquishable greenness.""  This perspective might explain the recurrence of his image and its recent adoption by environmental awareness movements as an assurance of ecological renewal. (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 2, the Green Man is ""indissolubly (inseparably) linked with the vegetative cycle…and exudes (pours forth) vitality and fertility and signals both material and spiritual abundance.""  Paragraph 6 reinforces this image of the Green Man by stating that ""[i]n Matthews' view, the Green Man is the embodiment of 'unvanquishable greenness.'""  Paragraph 6 then elaborates that ""[t]his perspective might explain the recurrence of [the Green Man's image] and its recent adoption by environmental awareness movements as an assurance of ecological renewal.""
This information shows that the Green Man is closely identified with the cyclical, regenerative power of nature.  Therefore, the author cites the term ""unvanquishable greenness"" to indicate nature's capacity to thrive and regenerate despite even the most harmful outside forces.
By contrast, the author does not cite the term ""unvanquishable greenness"" to indicate the capacity of nature:
to allow foliage to remain green throughout seasonal and climate changes(Choice B).  Paragraph 2 establishes the Green Man as ""indissolubly linked with the vegetative cycle and the agricultural year.""  Paragraph 6 is then able to relay that his image has been adopted ""by environmental awareness movements as an assurance of ecological renewal.""  This information suggests that the Green Man is closely identified with the power of nature as a regenerative phenomenon that follows a cycle and not as a potentially unvarying phenomenon where foliage remains green throughout seasonal and climate changes.
to promote vitality and fertility even in persistently barren environments (Choice C).  As Paragraph 2 establishes, the Green Man is ""[i]ndissolubly linked with the vegetative cycle and the agricultural year"" and ""exudes vitality and fertility.""  Paragraph 6 then further depicts the Green Man as embodying the regenerative power of nature and as symbolizing ""the assurance of ecological renewal.""  However, this information does not imply that nature has the capacity to promote vitality and fertility even in environments that, due to their inherent makeup or as a result of unrelenting and negative outside forces, are persistently barren.
to reduce the negative influences of human civilization (Choice D).  Paragraph 6 mentions ""the recent adoption"" of the Green Man image ""by environmental awareness movements as an assurance of ecological renewal.""  The existence of such movements reveals the need for people to reduce the negative influences of human civilization on the environment precisely because nature itself does not have that capacity."
"325","The passage suggests which of the following about cultures of the East?","B","58","The Green Man was also known farther east; for instance, near Hatra in present-day Iraq, an imposing leafy countenance stares out from the façade of an ancient temple. (Paragraph 3)
In the East this mythic being manifests in the figure of Al-Khidir, the Verdant or Green One who is a spiritual guide of heroes in the Koran. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 3 mentions that ""[t]he Green Man was also known farther east"" and that ""near Hatra in present-day Iraq, an imposing leafy countenance (face) stares out from the façade (outer wall) of an ancient temple.""  Paragraph 4 then outlines several possible Western ancestries for the Green Man before noting that ""[i]n the East this mythic being manifests in Al-Khidir, the Verdant or Green One who is a spiritual guide of heroes in the Koran.""
This information indicates a likely independent ancestry for the Green Man in the East.  Therefore, the passage suggests that cultures of the East developed a concept of the Green Man apart from Western views.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 3 states that ""[t]he Green Man was also known farther east; for instance, near Hatra in present-day Iraq, an imposing leafy countenance stares out from the façade of an ancient temple.""  However, this is the only example the passage provides of a Green Man image on a temple in the East.  Therefore, the passage never suggests that cultures of the East frequently used images of the Green Man to adorn temples.
(Choices C)  Paragraph 4 traces the possible ancestries of the Green Man, stating that ""[i]n the East this mythic being manifests in Al-Khidir, the Verdant or Green One who is a spiritual guide of heroes in Koran.""  Accordingly, this information suggests that the Green Man may have developed independently in the East rather than through influences from the West.  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that cultures of the East assimilated (absorbed) Western ideas to generate their own Green Man mythology.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 5 discusses how ""Green Man figures also pervade Western literature, which was influenced at its origin by the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh and its character of Enkidu, a wild, shaggy nature man.""  Furthermore, Paragraph 5 specifically cites the character of the Green Knight from the Arthurian tales as being ""like the eastern Al-Khidir (the Verdant or Green One in the Koran)…a warrior guide.""  This information suggests that Western cultures might have incorporated Eastern notions of the Green Man into their literature.  However, the passage never suggests that cultures of the East incorporated European notions of the Green Man into their literary tradition."
"326","The best summary of Paragraph 4 would be which of the following assertions?","B","58","The Green Man's lineage is multifaceted.  In the West he is a variant of Dionysus, the god of the vine who dies and is reborn.  Indeed, the fifth-century BCE statue of a leaf-clad Dionysus or Bacchus in Naples, Italy, is perhaps his oldest surviving image, although Dionysus may himself descend from the green-skinned Egyptian god Osiris who likewise dies and rises.

In the East this mythic being manifests in the figure of Al-Khidir, the Verdant or Green One who is a spiritual guide of heroes in the Koran. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 shows that ""[t]he Green Man's lineage (ancestry) is multifaceted.  In the West he is a variant of Dionysus, the god of the vine who dies and is reborn"" and who may in turn ""descend from the green-skinned Egyptian god Osiris.""  Furthermore, according to Paragraph 4, the Green Man ""is thought to be related to the rustic Greco-Roman deities Pan and Silvanus, and, more speculatively, to Cernunnos, the Celtic horned god of the hunt and lord of the animals.""
In addition, Paragraph 4 claims that ""[i]n the East this mythic being manifests in the figure of Al-Khidir, the Verdant or Green One who is a spiritual guide of heroes in the Koran.""  Consequently, the best summary of Paragraph 4 would be the assertion that there are several possible paths by which the idea of the Green Man could have evolved.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 4 emphasizes that ""[t]he Green Man's lineage is multifaceted"" and offers a number of possible Western ancestries, including the gods Dionysus and Cernunnos.  Paragraph 4 then notes that ""[i]n the East this mythic being manifests in the figure of Al-Khidir, the Verdant or Green One who is a spiritual guide of heroes in the Koran.""  Accordingly, the paragraph's emphasis is on the multitude of possible paths for the evolution of the Green Man, not on whether the Green Man may be found in both the East and West.  Therefore, the assertion that a crucial point is whether the Green Man appears in the East or just in the West is not the best summary of Paragraph 4.
(Choices C and D)  According to Paragraph 4, the Green Man ""is thought to be related to the rustic Greco-Roman deities Pan and Silvanus, and, more speculatively, to Cernunnos, the Celtic horned god of the hunt and lord of the animals.""  Although this information shows that most Green Man figures are related to other rustic deities and that some mythological characters have more connection to the Green Man than others, these assertions represent only part of the account of the Green Man's ""multifaceted"" lineage provided in Paragraph 4."
"327","The main idea of the passage is that:","D","59","The fledgling public television industry faced an uncertain future in the late 1960s….Richard Nixon hoped to reduce government spending and was considering a cut of 50% or more to that appropriation.  Before a final decision was made, public broadcasting representatives were invited to appear before Congress to make their case for the full funding.  One of their leaders, future Public Broadcasting Service president Hartford N. Gunn, Jr., asked TV personality Fred Rogers to join him in testifying as a key advocate for public television. (Paragraph 1)
Although highly regarded by his current audience, Rogers did not yet possess the level of recognition he would eventually obtain.  His televised appearance before the Subcommittee on Communications would be many Americans' first time seeing him. (Paragraph 2)
Although those criticisms had been leveled primarily at commercial programs, Pastore's views certainly couldn't have helped the case that Rogers needed to make.  The unproven nature of public television as a recent enterprise was an additional hurdle to securing the funding. (Paragraph 3)
Nevertheless, despite the odds stacked against him, Fred Rogers greatly impressed Pastore and the rest of the subcommittee. (Paragraph 4)
Rogers' simple but encouraging words clearly moved the subcommittee members, including Senator Pastore, who responded: ""Looks like you just earned the twenty million dollars.""  Hartford Gunn's gamble had paid off. (Paragraph 5)
The majority of the passage concerns the congressional hearing at which Fred Rogers testified about the value of funding public television.  Paragraph 1 explains that ""[t]he fledgling public television industry faced an uncertain future in the late 1960s"" and that the desire to preserve its funding led to ""Fred Rogers…testifying as a key advocate for public television.""  The passage then discusses Rogers' ""televised appearance before the Subcommittee on Communications"" (Paragraph 2) and ""the case that Rogers needed to make"" to convince Congress that the funding should be approved (Paragraph 3).
The remainder of the passage conveys how Rogers succeeded in this goal.  For instance, Paragraph 4 describes how his testimony ""greatly impressed Pastore and the rest of the subcommittee.""  Similarly, Paragraph 5 relates how Rogers' ""simple but encouraging words clearly moved the subcommittee members, including Senator Pastore, who responded: 'Looks like you just earned the twenty million dollars.'""  Accordingly, the main idea of the passage is that Fred Rogers played a pivotal role in securing the future of public television.
 (Choices A and C)  Fred Rogers demonstrated that public programming can benefit children's lives as well as their society; and Fred Rogers was a passionate advocate for children's welfare.  The passage does depict Rogers as a passionate advocate for children's welfare who thought public television could be beneficial for them and for society overall.  For instance, Paragraph 2 states that ""Rogers embodied moral values, a deep sense of purpose, and concern for the welfare of children.""  Similarly, Paragraph 4 describes ""Rogers' vision of public programming as a positive social force"" and his belief that ""taking children's problems seriously…makes a profound difference in the kind of people they become and the society they help to create.""
However, these points are raised in the context of Rogers' congressional testimony in favor of funding for public broadcasting, a subject that is discussed throughout the entire passage.  Accordingly, although these answer choices are expressed in the passage, they do not represent its main idea.
(Choice B)  government support was crucial to the establishment of public broadcasting in the 1960s.  Paragraph 1 describes a disagreement about funding for the ""fledgling public television industry"" in the 1960s: ""Lyndon Johnson allocated $20 million to create the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  In 1969, however… Richard Nixon hoped to reduce government spending and was considering a cut of 50% or more to that appropriation.""  However, while this information does indicate that the establishment of public broadcasting in the 1960s depended on government support, the majority of the passage concerns Fred Rogers' role in helping to secure that support."
"328","According to the passage, potential obstacles to Pastore approving the public broadcasting funding included all of the following EXCEPT:","B","59","Near the end of his presidency, Democrat Lyndon Johnson allocated $20 million to create the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  In 1969, however, his newly elected Republican successor Richard Nixon hoped to reduce government spending and was considering a cut of 50% or more to that appropriation.  Before a final decision was made, public broadcasting representatives were invited to appear before Congress to make their case for the full funding. (Paragraph 1)
Chairing the subcommittee hearing was Democratic senator John Pastore of Rhode Island, portrayed by King as ""a blunt, no-nonsense social conservative who shared the Republican interest in keeping federal spending in line.""  Pastore had also been critical of the television industry for what he saw as its promotion of immorality.  Although those criticisms had been leveled primarily at commercial programs, Pastore's views certainly couldn't have helped the case that Rogers needed to make.  The unproven nature of public television as a recent enterprise was an additional hurdle to securing the funding. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 1 describes a political disagreement over public broadcasting funding.  After ""Democrat Lyndon Johnson allocated $20 million to create the Corporation for Public Broadcasting… his newly elected Republican successor Richard Nixon hoped to reduce government spending and was considering a cut of 50% or more to that appropriation.""  However, Paragraph 3 conveys that while Senator Pastore was a Democrat, his views were more aligned with Nixon's than with Johnson's, as he ""'shared the Republican interest in keeping federal spending in line.'""
This information shows that Republican Richard Nixon and Democrat John Pastore shared the same concern about federal spending, despite being members of different parties.  Accordingly, the passage does not suggest that partisan political division (ie, differences in opinion based on political party affiliation) was a potential obstacle to Pastore approving the public broadcasting funding.  If anything, the opposite was true—Pastore's agreement with the other party's view was a potential ""hurdle to securing the funding"" (Paragraph 3).
 By contrast, the passage asserts that all of the following were potential obstacles to Pastore approving the public broadcasting funding:
public television's questionable viability (Choice A).  Paragraph 3 states that ""[t]he unproven nature of public television as a recent enterprise was an additional hurdle to securing the funding,"" indicating that there were doubts about the long-term prospects of public television.
U.S. budgetary concerns (Choice C).  Paragraph 1 states that Nixon ""hoped to reduce government spending,"" and Paragraph 3 adds that ""Senator John Pastore…'shared the Republican interest in keeping federal spending in line.'""  Accordingly, Senator Pastore had reason to consider cutting public broadcasting funding for the sake of the U.S. budget.
television's social impact (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 3, ""Pastore had also been critical of the television industry for what he saw as its promotion of immorality.""  Thus, his views about the social impact of television ""certainly couldn't have helped the case that Rogers needed to make"" in order to secure the funding."
"329","Which of the following discoveries would most weaken the author's assertion that Fred Rogers' testimony was crucial to securing the public broadcasting funding?","B","59","Richard Nixon hoped to reduce government spending and was considering a cut of 50% or more to that appropriation.  Before a final decision was made, public broadcasting representatives were invited to appear before Congress to make their case for the full funding.  One of their leaders, future Public Broadcasting Service president Hartford N. Gunn, Jr., asked TV personality Fred Rogers to join him in testifying as a key advocate for public television. (Paragraph 1)
In short, Rogers was an unusual figure to be chosen to testify before Congress.  Rogers' biographer Maxwell King describes Gunn's decision to depend so heavily on Rogers' testimony as ""a pretty big gamble."" (Paragraph 2)
Chairing the subcommittee hearing was Democratic senator John Pastore of Rhode Island, portrayed by King as ""a blunt, no-nonsense social conservative who shared the Republican interest in keeping federal spending in line.""  Pastore had also been critical of the television industry for what he saw as its promotion of immorality. (Paragraph 3)
Nevertheless, despite the odds stacked against him, Fred Rogers greatly impressed Pastore and the rest of the subcommittee.  Rather than giving the type of formal testimony that might have been expected at such a hearing, Rogers simply spoke earnestly about what, in his view, made public television so important. (Paragraph 4)
Rogers' simple but encouraging words clearly moved the subcommittee members, including Senator Pastore, who responded: ""Looks like you just earned the twenty million dollars.""  Hartford Gunn's gamble had paid off. (Paragraph 5)
The author portrays Fred Rogers' congressional testimony as the key to preserving funding for public television.  Facing a potential ""cut of 50% or more"" (Paragraph 1), Public Broadcasting Service representative Hartford Gunn took the ""'pretty big gamble'"" (Paragraph 2) of depending heavily on Rogers to persuade Congress to approve the full funding.  The odds were against him: not only did subcommittee chair Senator Pastore share Nixon's goal of ""keeping federal spending in line,"" Pastore was also ""critical of the television industry for what he saw as its promotion of immorality"" (Paragraph 3).
Nevertheless, Rogers succeeded.  According to Paragraph 4, he ""greatly impressed Pastore and the rest of the subcommittee"" as he ""simply spoke earnestly about what, in his view, made public television so important.""  Similarly, Paragraph 5 conveys that ""Rogers' simple but encouraging words clearly moved the subcommittee members, including Senator Pastore.""  The funding was approved, showing that ""Hartford Gunn's gamble had paid off.""
Accordingly, the author asserts that Rogers' heartfelt testimony convinced the subcommittee members that public television was valuable and worth the expense of funding.  However, if Hartford Gunn had convinced Congress that the economy would benefit from the growth of public broadcasting, that would suggest that those members might have had a different motive; instead of being persuaded by Rogers' words, they could have just thought the funding made economic sense.  Therefore, this discovery would weaken the author's assertion that Fred Rogers' testimony was crucial to securing that funding.
 By contrast, none of the following discoveries would weaken the author's assertion:
Lyndon Johnson had supported the establishment of public television throughout his presidency (Choice A).  Paragraph 1 states that ""[n]ear the end of his presidency, Democrat Lyndon Johnson allocated $20 million to create the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.""  However, whether Johnson also supported public broadcasting earlier in his presidency is irrelevant to whether Rogers' testimony was crucial to securing that funding at the congressional hearing.
Fred Rogers was not the only witness who testified before the subcommittee (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 1, ""public broadcasting representatives were invited to appear before Congress to make their case for the full funding,"" and ""Hartford N. Gunn, Jr., asked TV personality Fred Rogers to join him in testifying as a key advocate for public television.""  Thus, the passage suggests that there were other witnesses who testified besides Fred Rogers, but Rogers' testimony was what ""clearly moved the subcommittee members, including Senator Pastore"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, the discovery that Rogers was not the only witness who testified would be consistent with the author's assertion.
Senator Pastore's past criticisms of television had included public as well as commercial programming (Choice D).  If Pastore's criticisms of television's ""promotion of immorality"" included public programming instead of being ""leveled primarily at commercial programs"" (Paragraph 3), then he would have had even more reason to be skeptical of public television's value.  Therefore, this situation would further affirm the effectiveness of Rogers' testimony in changing Pastore's mind, supporting the author's assertion rather than weakening it."
"330","Based on passage information, it is most reasonable to assume that Rogers' congressional testimony was persuasive because:","C","59","Nevertheless, despite the odds stacked against him, Fred Rogers greatly impressed Pastore and the rest of the subcommittee.  Rather than giving the type of formal testimony that might have been expected at such a hearing, Rogers simply spoke earnestly about what, in his view, made public television so important.  He shared Pastore's worries about television's content, and was especially concerned about television geared toward children.  Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, which addressed children directly and acknowledged their unique perspective, was based on Rogers' vision of public programming as a positive social force.  As he explained, taking children's problems seriously and showing them that their lives can be understood and managed makes a profound difference in the kind of people they become and the society they help to create. (Paragraph 4)
Rogers' simple but encouraging words clearly moved the subcommittee members, including Senator Pastore, who responded: ""Looks like you just earned the twenty million dollars.""  Hartford Gunn's gamble had paid off. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 4 describes Fred Rogers' testimony at the congressional hearing and explains how it ""greatly impressed Pastore and the rest of the subcommittee.""  According to the author, Rogers ""simply spoke earnestly about what, in his view, made public television so important.""  His own television show was based on his ""vision of public programming as a positive social force,"" especially for children.  In particular, he was convinced that ""taking children's problems seriously and showing them that their lives can be understood and managed makes a profound difference in the kind of people they become and the society they help to create.""
The passage goes on to state that ""Rogers' simple but encouraging words clearly moved the subcommittee members, including Senator Pastore, who responded: 'Looks like you just earned the twenty million dollars'"" (Paragraph 5).  Accordingly, the passage conveys that once Rogers articulated his view of public television as a force for good in society, the subcommittee members were convinced of its value.  Therefore, it is most reasonable to assume that Rogers' congressional testimony was persuasive because his moral vision came across through his testimony.
 (Choice A)  he represented viewers who supported his program.  Paragraph 2 notes that at the time of the congressional hearing, ""Rogers did not yet possess the level of recognition he would eventually obtain.  His televised appearance before the Subcommittee on Communications would be many Americans' first time seeing him.""  Therefore, although there were viewers who supported Rogers' program, the passage suggests that this viewership was not yet extensive enough to have significantly affected the persuasiveness of his testimony.
(Choice B)  his study of childhood development gave his testimony authority.  Although Paragraph 2 states that Rogers had ""studied early childhood development under such prominent psychologists as Benjamin Spock and Margaret McFarland,"" it also states that at the time he ""was not widely known as an expert in that field.""  Accordingly, the passage does not suggest that Rogers' testimony was viewed as authoritative because of his study of early childhood development.
(Choice D)  he had chaired the White House Conference on Children.  According to Paragraph 5, ""Pastore himself testified the following year at the White House Conference on Children—an event chaired by none other than Fred Rogers.""  Therefore, Rogers' congressional testimony took place the year before he chaired the White House Conference on Children.  Accordingly, chairing that conference could not have impacted his previous congressional testimony."
"331","Which of the following situations is most similar to the ""interesting twist of affairs"" (Paragraph 5) concerning Fred Rogers and Senator Pastore?","A","59","…future Public Broadcasting Service president Hartford N. Gunn, Jr., asked TV personality Fred Rogers to join him in testifying as a key advocate for public television. (Paragraph 1)
Although highly regarded by his current audience, Rogers did not yet possess the level of recognition he would eventually obtain.  His televised appearance before the Subcommittee on Communications would be many Americans' first time seeing him. (Paragraph 2)
Chairing the subcommittee hearing was Democratic senator John Pastore of Rhode Island, portrayed by King as ""a blunt, no-nonsense social conservative who shared the Republican interest in keeping federal spending in line."" (Paragraph 3)
In an interesting twist of affairs, Pastore himself testified the following year at the White House Conference on Children—an event chaired by none other than Fred Rogers. (Paragraph 5)
Most of the passage discusses how Fred Rogers testified before the Congressional ""Subcommittee on Communications"" (Paragraph 2), serving as a witness at a hearing chaired by ""Democratic senator John Pastore of Rhode Island"" (Paragraph 3).  However, the passage concludes by describing ""an interesting twist of affairs"" in which ""Pastore himself testified the following year at the White House Conference on Children—an event chaired by none other than Fred Rogers"" (Paragraph 5).
Therefore, the ""interesting twist of affairs"" is the fact that Rogers and Pastore had reversed their roles from the previous hearing: Rogers was now the chair and Pastore the testifying witness.  Consequently, the situation most similar to this ""twist of affairs"" would be a professor takes a class taught by his former student.  In this situation the roles are likewise reversed: the former student is now the teacher and the former teacher is now the student.
 By contrast, none of the following situations represent a role reversal.  Therefore, they are not most similar to the ""interesting twist of affairs"" concerning Fred Rogers and Senator Pastore:
A priest attends a wedding officiated by his former church member (Choice B).  It cannot be assumed from this description that the former church member ever attended a wedding officiated by the priest.  Accordingly, in this scenario there is no indication that the priest and his former church member have swapped roles.
A lawyer argues a case judged by his former partner (Choice C).  This situation would mean that the lawyer's former partner is now a judge and that the lawyer is appearing in front of his former partner to argue a case.  However, in the past, the lawyer would not have judged cases argued by his partner; instead, each of them would have worked to prepare and argue cases before a judge.  Therefore, while the former partner's role has changed, the two lawyers have not reversed their previous roles.
A singer goes to a concert headlined by his former backup vocalist (Choice D).  Although the former backup vocalist is now a headline singer, the original singer is merely attending the concert rather than providing backup vocals."
"332","In describing Socrates as being ""uncanny"" and like ""a sorcerer,"" the author seems to suggest:","D","60","Moreover, in a culture that still put stock in magic, the highly charismatic, entertaining, and at times infuriating Socrates appeared to be a sorcerer bewitching the aristocratic young men of Athens who followed him fanatically about the agora. (Paragraph 1)
By all credible accounts, this exceedingly eccentric, self-styled radical truth-seeker had more than a whiff of the uncanny about him.  As Socrates himself explains in Plato's Republic, he was both blessed and burdened with a supernatural phenomenon in the form of a daimonion or inner spirit that always guided him. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 1 presents Socrates in his historical context: ""[I]n a culture that still put stock in magic, the highly charismatic, entertaining, and at times infuriating Socrates appeared to be a sorcerer bewitching the aristocratic young men of Athens who followed him fanatically about the agora (public marketplace).""  By calling Socrates not just ""charismatic"" but ""a sorcerer,"" the passage suggests that the philosopher's popularity seemed to exceed normal bounds; indeed, to outside observers it was as if he had cast a spell on his followers.
Paragraph 2 then conveys that Socrates ""had more than a whiff of the uncanny (otherworldly) about him"" and ""was both blessed and burdened with a supernatural phenomenon.""  This description supports the notion that Socrates was far from ordinary; he had something otherworldly or mysterious about him that seemed to attract followers but also made it difficult for many others to understand him.
Accordingly, in describing Socrates as ""uncanny"" and ""a sorcerer,"" the author seems to suggest that Socrates' motivations were not easy for many people to discern.
  (Choice A)  that only Socrates' followers could understand his method.  Paragraph 1 indicates that Socrates had dedicated disciples ""who followed him fanatically about the agora"" as he engaged with other people ""[i]n what struck some as a dangerous new method of inquiry.""  Accordingly, the passage suggests that Socrates' followers witnessed his method and likely gained some understanding of it even though ""some""—but not all—outside observers misinterpreted or misunderstood it.  Consequently, the passage never implies that Socrates' followers were the only ones able to understand his method.
(Choices B and C)  that Socrates tried to trick people into following him; and that Socrates was involved in magic or underhanded practices.  Paragraph 1 conveys that to some observers, Socrates ""appeared to be a sorcerer bewitching the aristocratic young men of Athens who followed him fanatically about the agora.""  However, although Socrates seemed to have an almost spellbinding effect on some people, the passage never indicates that he used trickery to get individuals to follow him; rather, it implies that he could effortlessly attract certain young men to him with his ""highly charismatic"" and ""entertaining"" nature.  Furthermore, while many Athenians ""still put stock in magic"" and may have believed that Socrates dabbled in sorcery, the passage never suggests that he did engage in underhanded practices."
"333","As the passage author uses the term, apotreptic most likely means:","A","60","As Socrates himself explains in Plato's Republic, he was both blessed and burdened with a supernatural phenomenon in the form of a daimonion or inner spirit that always guided him:  ""This began when I was a child.  It is a voice, and whenever it speaks, it turns me away from something I am about to do, but it never encourages me to do anything.""  An overtly rational thinker, Socrates nonetheless considered these warnings—or, in James Miller's words, ""the audible interdictions he experienced as irresistible""—to be infallible. (Paragraph 2)
As Socrates further insisted, it was only the protestations of this apotreptic voice that held him back from entering the political arena. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 2 presents Socrates' account of his daimonion or guiding spirit: ""'It is a voice, and whenever it speaks, it turns me away from something I am about to do, but it never encourages me to do anything.'""  The author then conveys James Miller's description of this voice as offering ""'audible interdictions (prohibitions)'"" that were ""'irresistible.'""  Paragraph 3 also stresses the notion of this guiding voice as essentially prohibitive or discouraging:  ""As Socrates further insisted, it was only the protestations of this apotreptic voice that held him back from entering the political arena.""
Accordingly, the passage indicates that the function of Socrates' guiding voice was always to hold him back and thus to forbid or discourage him from taking a particular action.  Therefore, as the passage author uses the term, apotreptic most likely means strongly discouraging.
  By contrast, the author does not use the term apotreptic to mean:
irritatingly inconvenient (Choice B).  In Paragraph 2, Socrates describes his daimonion or inner voice: ""'[I]t turns me away from something I am about to do, but it never encourages me to do anything.'""  Nevertheless, although this voice's utterances served to forbid, Socrates viewed these prohibitions positively, believing they constituted the guidance of a ""wholly benevolent deity"" (Paragraph 3).  Even when the philosopher was convicted at trial, he insisted that this ""'divine faculty would surely have opposed me had I been going to evil and not to good'"" (Paragraph 4).  Hence, the passage conveys that Socrates appreciated his guiding voice, not that he viewed it as irritatingly inconvenient.
highly ambiguous (Choice C).  Paragraph 2 conveys Socrates' account of the inner voice that always guided him by discouraging certain actions: ""[I]t turns me away from something I am about to do, but it never encourages me to do anything.""  In Paragraph 3, the author describes this voice as ""conveying unequivocal (straightforward) messages.""  Thus, the passage describes Socrates' guiding voice as consistent in its nature and as communicating in a way that is straightforward rather than confusing or ambiguous.
seemingly arbitrary (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 3, the inner voice that Socrates' hears is a negative faculty that ""'never encourages'"" and whose prohibitions the author, using James Miller's word, labels ""'irresistible.'""  Furthermore, as Paragraph 4 indicates, this daimonion is ""a wholly benevolent deity conveying unequivocal messages.""  Thus, this inner voice always communicates prohibitive messages to Socrates with the definite purpose of saving him from the negative consequences of specific actions; it does not intervene randomly or without due cause.  Accordingly, the passage does not present Socrates' guiding voice as being in any way arbitrary."
"334","Information in the passage would suggest that Socrates' heavy influence on the aristocratic young men of ancient Athens was largely due to his:
powerful personal magnetism.
intense engagement in purposeful dialogue.
intense devotion to civic duties.","C","60","Yet the philosopher's peculiar appearance was but a hint of the strange new calling he embraced.  Inspired perhaps by the famous Delphic dictum ""Know thyself,"" he embarked on a mission devoted to finding truth through dialogue.  In what struck some as a dangerous new method of inquiry, he subjected nearly everyone he encountered to intense cross-examination, mercilessly exposing the ignorance of his interlocutors.  Moreover, in a culture that still put stock in magic, the highly charismatic, entertaining, and at times infuriating Socrates appeared to be a sorcerer bewitching the aristocratic young men of Athens who followed him fanatically about the agora. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 emphasizes how ""the highly charismatic, entertaining, and at times infuriating Socrates appeared to be a sorcerer bewitching the aristocratic young men of Athens who followed him fanatically about the agora (public marketplace).""  Thus, the philosopher was able to attract these men through the sheer force of his personality.  Accordingly, Socrates' heavy influence on the aristocratic young men of ancient Athens can be attributed to his powerful personal magnetism (Number I).
As Paragraph 1 notes, Socrates ""embarked on a mission devoted to finding truth through dialogue"" in which ""he subjected nearly everyone he encountered to intense cross-examination, mercilessly exposing the ignorance of his interlocutors (conversational partners).""  As Socrates would usually have had an audience for this constant questioning—namely, ""the aristocratic young men of Athens who followed him fanatically about the agora""—it is reasonable to conclude that these individuals would have been impressed by his method of interrogation.  Consequently, the passage suggests that Socrates' intense engagement in purposeful dialogue contributed to his heavy influence on the aristocratic young men of ancient Athens (Number II).
  (Number III)  According to Paragraph 3, ""Socrates was brought before the court on trumped-up charges of impiety; these included willfully neglecting the traditional divinities"" and ""flagrantly introducing new gods to the city.""  These charges were extremely serious because ""Athenian society recognized no division between religious and civic duties.""  Furthermore, the passage suggests that there may have been some basis for these charges, specifically, Socrates' testimony revealing that he ""honored this personal god's authority above even the laws of the city.""  Thus, Socrates' devotion to civic duty was questionable as he refused to recognize the city's laws and values as the highest authority.  Consequently, the passage never implies that Socrates exhibited an intense devotion to civic duty."
"335","In the Theages, an ancient dialogue traditionally attributed to Plato, a student asks Socrates whether he ought to train for an athletic competition.  Given the information in the passage, which of the following would best explain why the student would have sought Socrates' counsel?","C","60","Inspired perhaps by the famous Delphic dictum ""Know thyself,"" [Socrates] embarked on a mission devoted to finding truth through dialogue.  In what struck some as a dangerous new method of inquiry, he subjected nearly everyone he encountered to intense cross-examination, mercilessly exposing the ignorance of his interlocutors. (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, Socrates believed that knowing oneself and finding truth were of the utmost importance, and thus he ""embarked on a mission devoted to finding truth through dialogue.""  Through dialoguing or cross-examining individuals, Socrates aimed to expose the ignorance that prevented them from discovering truth.  Thus, it would be reasonable to assume that this technique, which was intense, could help a person think critically and carefully to a sound decision.  Consequently, given the information in the passage, the statement that Socrates was dedicated to discovering the truth through deliberative conversation would best explain why the student would have sought the philosopher's counsel about whether to train for an athletic event.
  (Choices A and B)  Socrates was a highly eccentric character; and Socrates' behavior had made him a well-known figure in Athenian society. According to Paragraph 1, Socrates was well known for being eccentric in both his appearance and behavior.  In addition to his ""unshod and shabby"" image, Socrates was seen as practicing ""a dangerous new method of inquiry"" and even as ""a sorcerer bewitching the aristocratic young men of Athens who followed him fanatically about the agora.""  As Paragraph 2 stresses, Socrates was an ""exceedingly eccentric, self-styled radical truth-seeker"" who had ""more than a whiff of the uncanny (otherworldly) about him.""  However, the fact that Socrates was highly eccentric and had acquired notoriety as a public figure in Athens would not adequately explain why the student would have sought his counsel on whether to train for an athletic event.
(Choice D)  Socrates wore shabby clothing and was unconcerned with the appearance of wealth.  In Paragraph 1, the author describes Socrates' appearance: ""Most conspicuously, his unshod and shabby sartorial (pertaining to clothing) state flaunted poverty at a time when the city of Athens had become obsessed with wealth and its trappings.""  Although such details of Socrates' appearance might reflect the philosopher's eccentricity, authenticity, and perhaps even his rebelliousness, they do not reveal anything about his ability to counsel individuals.  Thus, the fact that the philosopher wore shabby clothing and was unconcerned with the appearance of wealth would not adequately explain why the student would have sought Socrates' counsel about training for the event."
"336","The passage author's view of Socrates' many eccentricities is that they constituted:","B","60","…[T]he potentially shapeshifting figure of Socrates found in the literary tradition…presents an intriguing array of oddities and unorthodoxies.  Most conspicuously, his unshod and shabby sartorial state flaunted poverty at a time when the city of Athens had become obsessed with wealth and its trappings.….  Inspired perhaps by the famous Delphic dictum ""Know thyself,"" he embarked on a mission devoted to finding truth through dialogue.  In what struck some as a dangerous new method of inquiry, he subjected nearly everyone he encountered to intense cross-examination, mercilessly exposing the ignorance of his interlocutors. (Paragraph 1)
By all credible accounts, this exceedingly eccentric, self-styled radical truth-seeker had more than a whiff of the uncanny about him….  [H]e was both blessed and burdened with a supernatural phenomenon in the form of a daimonion or inner spirit that always guided him…: ""It is a voice, and whenever it speaks, it turns me away from something I am about to do, but it never encourages me to do anything."" (Paragraph 2)
…Socrates maintained confidence in the protective nature and prophetic powers of his inner monitor.  He never questioned its affirmatory silence toward his predicament, remarking, ""The divine faculty would surely have opposed me had I been going to evil and not to good."" (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 1 portrays Socrates' ""array of oddities and unorthodoxies,"" which were manifest in his appearance and behavior, as purposeful to his overall mission and message of truth.  For instance, Socrates ""flaunted poverty at a time when the city of Athens had become obsessed with wealth and its trappings,"" suggesting he was sending a message to its citizens about what should be valued in society.  Socrates also ""embarked on a mission devoted to finding truth through dialogue"" and so began to practice ""what struck some as a dangerous new method of inquiry"" whereby he demonstrated to people their ignorance.
Paragraph 2 emphasizes how ""this exceedingly eccentric, self-styled radical truth-seeker…was both blessed and burdened with a supernatural phenomenon,"" which served to guide him in his mission.  Specifically, Socrates would hear a voice that, he claimed, ""turns me away from something I am about to do, but it never encourages me to do anything,"" and had, in fact, prohibited him from a political career.  Finally, throughout his trial, Socrates maintained faith in his protective daimonion, commenting that it ""'would surely have opposed me had I been going to evil and not to good'"" (Paragraph 4).
This information shows that Socrates' peculiar behaviors were tightly intertwined with his mission and message of promoting truth.  Consequently, the passage author's view of Socrates' eccentricities is that they constituted an essential part of his mission and message.
  (Choice A)  a means of disguising deceptive practices.  The passage suggests that Socrates' unusual behavior made some people suspicious of his motives.  For instance, his habit of questioning everyone ""struck some as a dangerous new method of inquiry,"" while his popularity among the youth made him seem like ""a sorcerer bewitching the aristocratic young men of Athens.""  However, the passage author never expresses agreement with these suspicions nor suggests Socrates was deceptive.  Instead, the author portrays Socrates as engaging in these practices publicly and also as openly discussing a strange voice or ""inner spirit that always guided him.""  Accordingly, the author does not view Socrates' eccentricities as a means of disguising deceptive practices.
(Choice C)  a pattern of behavior characteristic of a political rebel.  Paragraph 1 states that Socrates ""flaunted poverty at a time when the city of Athens was obsessed with wealth and its trappings,"" while Paragraph 3 claims that he held a ""personal god's authority above…the laws of the city.""  These details suggest that Socrates had a politically rebellious streak.  However, Paragraph 3 points out that the philosopher's political allegiances were ""ambiguous"" and that his inner voice's ""protestations…held him back from entering the political arena.""  Consequently, the author does not view Socrates' eccentricities as constituting the behavior pattern of a political rebel.
(Choice D)  symptoms of an identifiable syndrome from which he suffered.  According to the passage author, certain scholars have suggested that the voice Socrates claimed to hear could have been a symptom of a larger syndrome.  For instance, some scholars have dismissed it as ""a hallucination or psychological aberration,"" while others have connected it to Socrates' supposed ""cataleptic or trancelike episodes.""  However, the author never expresses agreement with either of these scholarly views.  Consequently, the passage does not suggest that the author views Socrates' eccentricities as being symptoms of an identifiable syndrome."
"337","The passage suggests that the most problematic aspect of Socrates' guiding spirit was:","D","60","In 399 BCE, Socrates was brought before the court on trumped-up charges of impiety; these included willfully neglecting the traditional divinities, flagrantly introducing new gods to the city, and wittingly corrupting the youth.  Athenian society recognized no division between religious and civic duties, and capricious gods demanded constant appeasement through sacrifices and rituals.  Consequently, belief in a purely private deity—particularly a wholly benevolent deity conveying unequivocal messages—was inadmissible.  Worse, as Socrates' own testimony revealed, he honored this personal god's authority above even the laws of the city.  Thus, the philosopher's daimonion loomed over his indictment, conviction, and sentencing. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 connects Socrates' claims about his guiding spirit to the accusations brought against him at trial: ""willfully neglecting the traditional divinities"" and ""flagrantly introducing new gods to the city.""  These charges were extremely serious because ""Athenian society recognized no division between religious and civic duties, and capricious (fickle) gods demanded constant appeasement (pacifying) through sacrifices and rituals.""  For Athenian citizens, this meant that ""belief in a purely private deity…was inadmissible.""  Worse still, as the author notes, Socrates' gave testimony to the effect that he ""honored this personal god's authority above even the laws of the city.""
Accordingly, the philosopher's daimonion, which was not recognized as a god by the city but for him served as the supreme authority, was perceived as a threat to the established Athenian religious and civic order.  Thus, his guiding spirit was so controversial that it ""loomed over his indictment, conviction, and sentencing.""  Therefore, given this information, the passage suggests that the most problematic aspect of Socrates' guiding spirit was its threat to society.
  (Choices A and C)  its show of benevolence; and its clarity as an oracle.  According to Paragraph 3, Socrates' guiding spirit diverged from the Athenian conception of divinity.  Whereas the official gods of Athens were viewed as ""capricious"" and requiring ""constant appeasement,"" Socrates' daimonion was ""wholly benevolent"" and ""unequivocal"" (straightforward) in its communications.  However, as Socrates' own testimony revealed, there was another, more controversial aspect of this daimonion, namely that ""he honored this personal god's authority above even the laws of the city.""  Therefore, while the benevolence and clarity of Socrates' guiding spirit may have been viewed as problematic, these aspects were seen as less problematic than what appeared to constitute a challenge to society or the city's own authority.
(Choice B)  its manifestation as a voice.  Paragraph 2 provides Socrates' own account of his guiding spirit: ""'It is a voice, and whenever it speaks, it turns me away from something I am about to do.'""  The author further explains that these vocal warnings ""seemed anomalous (strange) as tutelary (guiding) spirits usually assumed a more nuanced presence.""  Thus, the manifestation of Socrates' guiding spirit as a voice was controversial; however, the issue of the daimonion's vocal manifestation was not pivotal in the philosopher's trial, showing it was less problematic than the threat this spirit posed to society in being the philosopher's supreme authority."
"338","According to the author, the effectiveness of democratic government is diminished by which of the following?
The pace at which changes are made
Its attempt to ensure all citizens' well-being
Its tendency toward political deadlock","B","61","A common joke states: ""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the other ones.""  The motivations for disparaging democracy are clear enough: its inefficiency, the intransigence of competing political viewpoints, the seeming inability of so-called leaders to take necessary actions. (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, two of the common ""motivations for disparaging (criticizing or devaluing) democracy"" relate to the slow speed with which goals are accomplished.  For instance, the author refers to the ""inefficiency"" of democracy, as well as ""the seeming inability of so-called leaders to take necessary actions.""  If democracies are inefficient and their leaders seem unable to take action, then any change would occur only slowly, if at all.  Therefore, the author suggests that the effectiveness of democratic government is diminished by the pace at which changes are made (Number I).
In Paragraph 1, the author mentions several perceived drawbacks to democratic forms of government.  One of these problems is ""the intransigence of competing political viewpoints,"" or the fact that people can rarely be persuaded to reconsider their political opinions.  If different groups have opposing views about an issue, and no one's mind can be changed, then clearly no agreement can be reached.  Therefore, the author suggests that the effectiveness of democratic government is diminished by its tendency toward political deadlock (Number III).
 (Number II)  Its attempt to ensure all citizens' well-being.  The author never suggests that focusing on citizens' well-being hinders the effectiveness of democracy (or of any form of government).  In fact, he or she suggests just the opposite.  For instance, in presenting ""the best possible case"" for a benevolent dictatorship, the author stipulates that such a dictator ""is always motivated by a genuine belief about the best interests of the people"" (Paragraph 2).  Similarly, Paragraph 3 describes the advantages of more easily securing these best interests: the ""wise and kindly rulers"" make decisions ""immediately, without a laborious (and possibly futile) process of seeking consensus.""  Therefore, the author implies that ensuring citizens' well-being is the purpose of effective government, not a factor that diminishes a government's effectiveness."
"339","According to the author's description of a benevolent dictatorship, the relationship between dictators and subjects is most similar to the relationship between:","D","61","For instance, we will specify that the dictator in question truly is benevolent and never acts from a corrupt or self-centered purpose.  We can remain undecided about whether this means the dictator is morally and/or intellectually perfect; however, we must assume at minimum that he or she is always motivated by a genuine belief about the best interests of the people. (Paragraph 2)
These wise and kindly rulers make life stable and predictable.  When decisions are required, they are made immediately, without a laborious (and possibly futile) process of seeking consensus….  Second, the citizens would likely be worse off if they could change those decisions, because all the ruler's actions are aimed at the citizens' best interest anyway. (Paragraph 3)
The right decisions are made, the right laws are drafted, the right actions are taken, all without the impediment of needing to persuade anyone of their rightness….  Even on the hypothesis that the citizens are better off due to the dictator's actions, those citizens can play no role in bringing about the beneficial states of affairs.  But there is an intrinsic value to possessing that capability. (Paragraph 4)
According to the author, a benevolent dictator always acts from his or her judgment about ""the best interests of the people"" (Paragraph 2).  Crucially, however, such a ruler simply decides on the most beneficial laws and courses of action, regardless of the citizens' own views: ""The right decisions are made, the right laws are drafted, the right actions are taken, all without the impediment of needing to persuade anyone of their rightness"" (Paragraph 4).
In other words, the dictator determines all the laws and policies by which the citizens must abide, and these rules are designed to ensure the citizens' well-being.  However, the citizens themselves ""play no role in bringing about the beneficial states of affairs"" (Paragraph 4).
Similarly, parents act as ""wise and kindly rulers [who] make life stable and predictable"" (Paragraph 3) for their young children, without the need to consult the children about rules and decisions.  Like the lives of citizens under a benevolent dictator, children's lives are largely shaped by their parents' choices for them.  Consequently, according to the author's description of a benevolent dictatorship, the relationship between dictators and subjects is most similar to the relationship between parents and young children.
 By contrast, the relationship between benevolent dictators and their subjects is not most similar to the relationship between:
lawyers and jury members (Choice A).  According to the author, in a benevolent dictatorship ""[t]he right decisions are made…without the impediment of needing to persuade anyone of their rightness"" (Paragraph 4).  However, lawyers must make arguments to persuade jury members to reach a certain verdict; the jury members then decide for themselves whether to accept what a lawyer claims is the right decision.  Therefore, this relationship is significantly different from the one between benevolent dictators and their citizens.
donors and charity workers (Choice B).  By providing money or other resources, donors help enable charity workers to meet their goals.  However, in most cases such goals are established by the charity itself rather than the donors.  For instance, suppose that a charity is devoted to feeding the hungry.  In that case, a donor would be facilitating the charity's prior decision to provide food to the poor; he or she would not be making decisions that the charity workers have no choice but to follow.
psychologists and therapy patients (Choice C).  A psychologist typically provides insight based on ""a genuine belief about the best interests of"" his or her patients (Paragraph 2).  However, such a patient is free to either accept or reject that insight.  Hence, this relationship is unlike that of a benevolent dictatorship, in which the dictator makes decisions for the citizens."
"340","Which of the following problems with dictatorships is NOT implied in the passage?","B","61","The motivations for disparaging democracy are clear enough: its inefficiency, the intransigence of competing political viewpoints, the seeming inability of so-called leaders to take necessary actions. (Paragraph 1)
These wise and kindly rulers make life stable and predictable.  When decisions are required, they are made immediately, without a laborious (and possibly futile) process of seeking consensus.  When laws must be drafted, they are aimed at the good of the people, without interference from partisan special interest groups.  When injustices arise, they are addressed, without preference given to the privileged and powerful….  Thus, all things are brought to fruition as they should be, with decisiveness and rapidity.  Have we now then, at least theoretically, described the perfect government? (Paragraph 3)
According to the author, one notable feature of dictatorships is that decisions are easily made and implemented.  Paragraph 3 in particular stresses this point: ""When decisions are required, they are made immediately, without a laborious (and possibly futile) process of seeking consensus….  Thus, all things are brought to fruition as they should be, with decisiveness and rapidity.""
Therefore, although Paragraph 1 suggests that democracies suffer from ""the seeming inability of so-called leaders to take necessary actions,"" the passage implies that the opposite is true in dictatorships, where leaders take swift action.  Consequently, the passage does not imply that a dictator may fail to take decisive action when necessary.
 (Choices A and D)  A dictator can easily abuse his or her power for personal gain; and A dictator could be unconcerned with the well-being of the people.  In Paragraph 2, the author discusses some of the ""obvious potential drawbacks"" of dictatorships that must be addressed to make benevolent dictatorship a desirable form of government.  For instance, the author specifies that ""the dictator in question truly [must be] benevolent and never [act] from a corrupt or self-centered purpose.""  Similarly, such a dictator must be ""always motivated by a genuine belief about the best interests of the people.""  Accordingly, the author implies that a dictator who is not benevolent could abuse his or her power for personal gain, instead of exercising that power for the sake of the citizens' well-being.
(Choice C)  A dictator who is benevolent may be succeeded by one who is not.  According to Paragraph 2, part of making ""the best possible case"" for a benevolent dictatorship is to ""address (or stipulate away) its most obvious potential drawbacks.""  One of these drawbacks concerns the succession from one ruler to another, as the author asserts that we must ""assume that when the dictator's reign ends, he or she is automatically replaced by someone of equal or greater benevolence.""  Hence, the author implies that even if a dictator truly is benevolent, his or her successor could instead be cruel and oppressive."
"341","Based on the information in Paragraph 1, a ""mobocracy"" refers to a form of government that:","B","61","The motivations for disparaging democracy are clear enough: its inefficiency, the intransigence of competing political viewpoints, the seeming inability of so-called leaders to take necessary actions.  Moreover, the risk of arriving at decisions based on the lowest common denominator of average (or sub-average) citizens cannot be discounted.  Hence, especially if we are sufficiently assured of our own wisdom, we must also add the threat of ""mobocracy"" to this list of grievances.  Given these numerous flaws, it is tempting to wonder: might not a benevolent dictatorship be a superior form of governance? (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 discusses some of the ""numerous flaws"" of democracies, including what the author calls ""the threat of 'mobocracy.'""  Specifically, this threat involves ""the risk of arriving at decisions based on the lowest common denominator of average (or sub-average) citizens.""  In other words, the author suggests that in a democracy, a majority of citizens could agree on harmful, poorly conceived ideas.  This point is further emphasized by contrasting such ideas with ""our own wisdom.""  Thus, the author distinguishes a minority of wiser citizens from the foolish ""mob"" that would comprise the ruling majority.
Therefore, based on the information in Paragraph 1, a ""mobocracy"" refers to a form of government that is influenced by the uninformed opinions of the masses.
 (Choices A and D)  does not facilitate rule by the majority; and struggles at maintaining consensus.  According to Paragraph 1, a ""'mobocracy'"" entails ""arriving at decisions based on the lowest common denominator of average (or sub-average) citizens.""  Thus, the passage implies that a mobocracy does represent a consensus.  Similarly, since this consensus is based on the ""lowest common denominator"" of citizens, it would pertain to a majority of people.  Therefore, the passage never suggests that this form of government fails to facilitate rule by the majority or struggles to maintain consensus.  Rather, the ""threat of 'mobocracy'"" is that although consensus is achieved by a majority of citizens, the agreed upon ideas are harmful.
(Choice C)  magnifies the flaws of most other types of government.  Paragraph 1 discusses several ""motivations for disparaging (criticizing or devaluing) democracy,"" including the fear that it can lead to a ""'mobocracy'"" or rule by a foolish majority.  In other words, a mobocracy represents a negative extreme of democratic governance.  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that a mobocracy magnifies the flaws of other types of governments.  Rather, the risk of mobocracy is a specific example of the ""numerous flaws"" associated with democracy."
"342","According to the author, a crucial disadvantage of a benevolent dictatorship would be that:","D","61","I submit that we have not, because something important has been left out.  Note that the successes of this benevolent dictatorship are entirely of a consequentialist nature.  The right decisions are made, the right laws are drafted, the right actions are taken, all without the impediment of needing to persuade anyone of their rightness.  But by removing that impediment, one also largely removes the connection between people's welfare and their choices.  Even on the hypothesis that the citizens are better off due to the dictator's actions, those citizens can play no role in bringing about the beneficial states of affairs.  But there is an intrinsic value to possessing that capability. (Paragraph 4)
A path that people have a hand in choosing is qualitatively different from a path that is laid out for them, even when both paths lead to the same destination.  Likewise, persuasion and consensus building have a value that goes beyond the mere arrival at a well-reasoned decision, even when one is on the losing side of a debate.  At bottom, democracy is founded on faith—faith that in a free contest of ideas, the good can be established and the true can be recognized.  The chance to intentionally strive for such goodness and truth, both individually and collectively, is in itself more valuable than the guarantee that they will be imposed from outside. (Paragraph 5)
The ultimate point of the passage is that democracy is superior to benevolent dictatorship, because there is an importance to democratic participation over and above whatever outcomes a government achieves.  The author argues that even if a dictator's decisions cause the citizens to be better off, ""those citizens can play no role in bringing about the beneficial states of affairs.  But there is an intrinsic value to possessing that capability"" (Paragraph 4).
Paragraph 5 further stresses this point, asserting that ""persuasion and consensus building have a value that goes beyond the mere arrival at a well-reasoned decision.""  The passage concludes with a similar claim: ""The chance to intentionally strive for such goodness and truth…is in itself more valuable than the guarantee that they will be imposed from outside.""
Therefore, the passage conveys that it would not be worth losing the ability of citizens to engage in a ""free contest of ideas"" (Paragraph 5), even if a single benevolent ruler could make better decisions for the citizens overall.  Consequently, a crucial disadvantage of a benevolent dictatorship would be that a benevolent dictatorship's benefits to society are outweighed by the sacrifice they require.
 (Choice A)  a benevolent dictator would make decisions that citizens disagree with.  Paragraph 3 states that ""[a]t times, some citizens may disagree with a ruler's decisions for the country.""  However, the author conveys that this point is ""unimportant,"" noting that ""the same is true under other forms of government.""  Thus, the author suggests that even if this fact is a disadvantage, it is not specific to benevolent dictatorships but applies to other forms of governments as well.
(Choice B)  a benevolent dictator's decisions may be subject to change.  According to Paragraph 3, the benevolent dictator's decisions make citizens better off ""because all the ruler's actions are aimed at the citizens' best interest.""  The author then adds: ""In addition, a ruler can always reverse course if events do not turn out as he or she had planned.""  Therefore, although the passage suggests that a benevolent dictator's decisions may be subject to change, the author does not treat this fact as a disadvantage.  Rather, he or she implies it is an advantage that the dictator could easily make changes to correct a problematic situation.
(Choice C)  a benevolent dictatorship can only be described in a theoretical sense, not actually put into practice.  The author is up-front about the fact that his or her discussion of benevolent dictatorships is theoretical.  For instance, Paragraph 2 states that ""[t]o make the best possible case in favor of such a government, we must address (or stipulate away) its most obvious potential drawbacks.""  The author later asks in Paragraph 3: ""Have we now then, at least theoretically, described the perfect government?""  Therefore, the author treats the theoretical nature of the discussion as an intentional part of his or her argument, not as a disadvantage of benevolent dictatorships."
"343","Based on the information in Paragraph 5, with which of the following statements would the passage author most likely agree?","C","61","A path that people have a hand in choosing is qualitatively different from a path that is laid out for them, even when both paths lead to the same destination.  Likewise, persuasion and consensus building have a value that goes beyond the mere arrival at a well-reasoned decision, even when one is on the losing side of a debate.  At bottom, democracy is founded on faith—faith that in a free contest of ideas, the good can be established and the true can be recognized.  The chance to intentionally strive for such goodness and truth, both individually and collectively, is in itself more valuable than the guarantee that they will be imposed from outside. (Paragraph 5)
In Paragraph 5, the author compares two hypothetical situations.  In the first, the citizens of a government ""have a hand in choosing"" their country's direction.  In the second, a benevolent dictator makes beneficial choices for the citizens without their input.  The author suggests that the first option would be a superior form of governance, even if the decisions were the same in each case: ""persuasion and consensus building have a value that goes beyond the mere arrival at a well-reasoned decision.""
The author then takes the point even further.  Specifically, he or she argues that the first form of government is superior even if the citizens' decisions are worse than a dictator's would have been.  According to the author, citizens' opportunity to engage in a ""free contest of ideas…is in itself more valuable than the guarantee that [the best ideas] will be imposed from outside.""  In other words, the author concludes that a government where everyone has a voice is inherently preferable to one where a ruler has sole authority (even if the ruler could make more optimal decisions).
Therefore, based on the information in Paragraph 5, the passage author would most likely agree that the best governments incorporate many perspectives.
 (Choice A)  The more voices that speak, the less there is worth hearing.  This saying suggests that when many people contribute to a discussion, the overall quality of ideas diminishes.  However, the author makes an essentially opposite point in arguing for the value of democracy, which ""is founded on faith…that in a free contest of ideas, the good can be established and the true can be recognized"" (Paragraph 5).
(Choice B)  The best rulers lead by example, not by command.  The author compares the potential ""successes of [a] benevolent dictatorship"" (Paragraph 4) with the value of a ""democracy [that] is founded on…a free contest of ideas"" (Paragraph 5).  However, he or she never draws a comparison between leading by example and leading by command, nor discusses the idea of rulers leading by example.
(Choice D)  Only in hindsight can the wisest perspectives be recognized.  The author highlights the importance of ""persuasion and consensus building…in a free contest of ideas [where] the good can be established and the true can be recognized"" (Paragraph 5).  However, he or she never discusses the role of hindsight in recognizing the wisdom of particular perspectives."
"344","Which of the following claims about representation is implied by Baudrillard's notion of the simulacrum?","A","62","In its penultimate phase, the representation no longer pretends to be the original but now instead pretends to be a copy; hence, it masks an absence of reality and erodes the distinction between the real and representation….  In the final stage of the sign's devolution, it can claim ""no relation to any reality whatsoever""; it no longer reflects or refers to reality but instead signifies nothing but signification.  It has become a pure simulation, a suspiciously specious semblance Baudrillard calls the simulacrum. (Paragraph 2)
In Baudrillardian theory, when the distinction between representation and reality…disintegrates, the real disappears; we are left with copies of copies that no longer have—or never had—an original.  What remains, then, is a ""hyperreality"" of simulacra and simulation. (Paragraph 3)
According to Baudrillardian theory, ""In its penultimate (next to last) phase, the representation no longer pretends to be the original but now instead pretends to be a copy; hence, it masks an absence of reality and erodes the distinction between the real and representation.""  Finally, the representation devolves to the point ""it can claim 'no relation to any reality whatsoever'; it no longer reflects or refers to reality"" (Paragraph 2).  Furthermore, Paragraph 3 suggests that ""when the distinction between representation and reality…disintegrates, the real disappears; we are left with copies of copies"" or ""a 'hyperreality' of simulacra and simulation.""
Accordingly, the simulacrum is a form of representation that has become disassociated from any original or reality and now replaces it.  Therefore, Baudrillard's notion of the simulacrum implies that representation and reality become disconnected.
  By contrast, Baudrillard's notion of the simulacrum does not imply any of the following claims:
Representation is meant to destroy the original (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 3, ""In Baudrillardian theory, when the distinction between representation and reality…disintegrates, the real disappears"" into ""a 'hyperreality' of simulacra and simulation.""  Baudrillardian theory also claims that simulation or representation ""is no longer a question of imitation, nor duplication"" but ""of 'substituting the signs of the real for the real.'""  According to one writer, ""'[S]imulation is no longer a reflection of reality, nor a reference to it, but a creation of a new real by models…not based on reality.'""  This information suggests that when representation devolves into simulation or the simulacrum it replaces the original; however, the passage never implies such representation is intended to destroy the original.
Representation is a way to access reality directly (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 1, ""[O]ur postmodernist world is saturated with signs…that are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it.""  As Paragraph 3 clarifies, ""[W]hen the distinction between representation and reality…disintegrates, the real disappears; we are left with copies of copies"" having no originals.  Thus ""reality dissolves into the hyperreality of simulacra.""  Consequently, in Baudrillardian theory, representation does not grant direct access to reality but filters and creates it.
Representation maintains its fidelity to the original (Choice D).  ""In Baudrillard's scheme, signs are subject to degeneration"" (Paragraph 2).  As noted, ""Initially, a sign reflects reality"" and ""is a faithful but identifiable copy.""  However, ""the sign devolves into a less faithful copy of the original, thus distorting what it represents.""  Moreover, as Paragraph 3 stresses, ""the distinction between representation and reality…disintegrates"" until ""we are left with copies of copies"" having no originals—that is, with simulacra.  Accordingly, representation becomes less faithful (ie, it loses its fidelity to the original)."
"345","As it is used by the passage author, the term simulacrum is most aptly defined as:","B","62","In the final stage of the sign's devolution, it can claim ""no relation to any reality whatsoever""; it no longer reflects or refers to reality but instead signifies nothing but signification.  It has become a pure simulation, a suspiciously specious semblance Baudrillard calls the simulacrum. (Paragraph 2)
In Baudrillardian theory, when the distinction between representation and reality, sign and referent, original and reproduction disintegrates, the real disappears; we are left with copies of copies that no longer have—or never had—an original.  What remains, then, is a ""hyperreality"" of simulacra and simulation….  As one writer describes it, ""The simulation is no longer a reflection of reality, nor a reference to it, but a creation of a new real by models that are not based on reality."" (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 2, Baudrillard's devolved sign or simulacrum ""can claim 'no relation to any reality whatsoever'; it no longer reflects or refers to reality.""  The simulacrum is ""pure simulation, a suspiciously specious (attractive but empty) semblance.""
Paragraph 3 then elaborates on this disconnection of the simulacrum to reality: ""In Baudrillardian theory, when the distinction between representation and reality, sign and referent…disintegrates, the real disappears.""  More specifically, ""we are left with copies of copies"" that have no originals—that is, with ""a 'hyperreality' of simulacra and simulation.""  Furthermore, in Baudrillard's view, ""'[s]imulation is no longer that of…a referential being…but of 'substituting the signs of the real for the real.'""  According to one writer, ""'The simulation is no longer a reflection of reality, nor a reference to it, but a creation of a new real by models that are not based on reality.'""
Accordingly, once a representation becomes a simulacrum, it loses its ability to represent, reflect, or refer to reality.  Therefore, the term simulacrum is most aptly defined as an example of the basic absence of referentiality.
  (Choices A and C)  an example of the power of faithful representation; and a convincing counterfeit of an original.  According to Paragraph 2, ""In Baudrillard's scheme, signs are subject to degeneration.  Initially, a sign reflects reality…like a carefully crafted counterfeit, it is a faithful but identifiable copy.""  However, ""the sign devolves into a less faithful copy of the original.""  This devolution continues until ""the distinction between representation and reality…disintegrates, [and] the real disappears; we are left with copies of copies"" that have no originals—that is, simulacra (Paragraph 3).  Consequently, the passage author depicts the simulacrum as neither a faithful representation nor a counterfeit of an original.
(Choice D)  a deceptive phenomenon that resists duplication.  According to Paragraph 2, ""[W]hen images are mass produced, they propagate (spread widely), taking on a life of their own and diminishing the authoritative aura of the original.""  Eventually, such a duplicated image has ""'no relation to any reality whatsoever.'""  Hence, such a representation ""has become a pure simulation"" or the simulacrum.  Likewise, Paragraph 3 conveys Baudrillard's view that ""'[s]imulation is…no longer a question of imitation, nor duplication"" but ""of 'substituting the signs of the real for the real.'""  Accordingly, the passage describes the simulacrum as a ""specious"" or deceptive phenomenon that is no longer even a duplication but a ""new real.""  However, the passage never indicates whether the simulacrum itself resists duplication."
"346","The well-known aphorism cited in Paragraph 1:","C","62","Jorge Luis Borges' 1946 short story…plays with the well-known aphorism, ""The map is not the territory.""  In this paragraph-long fable, an empire's ambitious cartographers produce a map so spectacularly isomorphic it corresponds precisely in scale and detail with the kingdom it represents.  Perfect yet useless, the map is virtually indistinguishable from the landscape until it begins to decay.  …Jean Baudrillard cites Borges' tale as ""the finest allegory"" of his own provocative proposition that, in the current era, we have lost the ability to distinguish between reality and its representation.  Thus, Baudrillard…postulates that ""it is no longer a question of either maps or territories""; rather, ""[s]omething has disappeared: the sovereign difference, between one and the other"" that, he laments, once ""constituted the charm of abstraction.""  Indeed, our postmodernist world is saturated with signs, symbols, and images that are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it.  Consequently… Baudrillard can assert that ""today it is the territory whose shreds slowly rot across the map.…  [T]he territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it.""  Instead, ""[i]t is…the map that precedes the territory…that engenders the territory."" (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 states that Borges' story ""plays with the well-known aphorism (concise statement meant to relay a general truth), 'The map is not the territory.'""  The story illustrates how, when a map is ""so spectacularly isomorphic (the same in form) it corresponds precisely in scale and detail with the kingdom it represents,"" it is ""useless"" in being ""virtually indistinguishable from the landscape.""
According to Paragraph 1, Baudrillard ""cites Borges' tale as 'the finest allegory' (extended metaphor) of his own provocative proposition that, in the current era, we have lost the ability to distinguish between reality and its representation.""  Baudrillard then clarifies, ""'[I]t is no longer a question of either maps or territories'; rather, '[s]omething has disappeared: the sovereign (absolute) difference, between one and the other' that…once 'constituted the charm of abstraction.'""  As the passage further explains, in our postmodernist era, such images ""are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it.""  Thus, Baudrillard claims, ""'today it is the territory whose shreds slowly rot across the map'"" because now ""'[i]t is…the map that precedes the territory.'""
Baudrillard's interpretation of Borges' tale as a metaphor for his own theory of representation implies that people are not so much prone to confusing the map and the territory but of confusing representation and reality in general.  Furthermore, Baudrillard's lament about the current era's inability to distinguish reality from representation projects a desire to believe that the boundaries between reality and its representation were at one time more stable.
Consequently, the well-known aphorism cited in Paragraph 1 suggests a residual belief in a reality distinct from any form of representation.
  (Choices A and D)  exposes a hidden power struggle between image-makers and rulers; and encapsulates a myth propagated by rulers to help control their subjects.  Borges' tale tells how ""an empire's ambitious cartographers (mapmakers) produce a map so spectacularly isomorphic it corresponds precisely in scale and detail with the kingdom it represents"" (Paragraph 1).  However, the passage provides no additional information regarding this fictional kingdom; it mentions only the mapmakers—not the rulers, subjects, or other image-makers—and never discusses power struggles.
(Choice B)  offers a cautionary statement for ambitious cartographers trying to elevate mapmaking.  Within the context of Borges' fable, the aphorism that ""'the map is not the territory'"" might seem to be a cautionary statement or warning to ""ambitious cartographers.""  However, within the context of Paragraph 1 and Baudrillard's use of the fable as a metaphor for his own theory, the aphorism pertains more specifically to the larger relationship of representation to reality.  Thus, this ""well-known aphorism"" is primarily urging people to pay attention to the essential difference between reality and representation."
"347","The central idea of the passage is that, in Baudrillard's view:","C","62","Indeed, our postmodernist world is saturated with signs, symbols, and images that are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it.…  As [Baudrillard] elaborates, ""[T]he territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it.""  Instead, ""[i]t is…the map that precedes the territory…that engenders the territory.""  In other words, representation can be seen to precede, produce, and ultimately surpass reality. (Paragraph 1)
In Baudrillard's scheme, signs are subject to degeneration.  Initially, a sign reflects reality…it is a faithful but identifiable copy….[T]he sign devolves…distorting what it represents and masking reality.  In its penultimate phase…it masks an absence of reality and erodes the distinction between the real and representation.…  In the final stage of the sign's devolution, it can claim ""no relation to any reality whatsoever""….  It has become a pure simulation, a suspiciously specious semblance Baudrillard calls the simulacrum. (Paragraph 2)
In Baudrillardian theory, when the distinction between representation and reality, sign and referent, original and reproduction disintegrates, the real disappears; we are left with copies of copies that no longer have—or never had—an original.  What remains, then, is a ""hyperreality"" of simulacra and simulation.…  Likewise, as reality dissolves into the hyperreality of simulacra, human experience devolves into ""a simulation of reality."" (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 1, ""[O]ur postmodernist world is saturated with signs…that are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it.""  Furthermore, ""As [Baudrillard] elaborates, '[T]he territory no longer precedes the map'….  Instead, '[i]t is…the map that precedes the territory…that engenders (produces) the territory.'""  Hence, ""representation can be seen to precede, produce, and ultimately surpass reality.""
Paragraph 2 explains how, in Baudrillard's view, signs degenerate: ""Initially, a sign reflects reality…it is a faithful but identifiable copy.""  Later, ""the sign devolves…distorting what it represents and masking reality.""  Next, ""it masks an absence of reality and erodes the distinction between the real and representation.""  Finally, ""it can claim 'no relation to any reality whatsoever'….  It has become a pure simulation… the simulacrum.""
Paragraph 3 concludes: ""In Baudrillardian theory, when the distinction between representation and reality…disintegrates, the real disappears; we are left with copies of copies"" without originals that constitute ""a 'hyperreality' of simulacra and simulation.""  Thus, ""reality dissolves into the hyperreality of simulacra"" while ""human experience devolves into 'a simulation of reality.'""
Accordingly, the passage emphasizes representation as filtering and so constructing reality.  Therefore, the central idea of the passage is that, in Baudrillard's view, the reality we come to know is unavoidably artificial.
  By contrast, none of the following statements represents the passage's central idea:
a simulation is something we can never fully experience (Choice A).  As Paragraph 1 conveys, ""[O]ur postmodernist world is saturated with signs…that are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it.""  Similarly, ""as reality dissolves into the hyperreality of simulacra, human experience devolves into 'a simulation of reality'"" (Paragraph 3).  Accordingly, what we always experience is simulation and simulacra, or mediated reality.
signs, reproductions, and copies are examples of simulacra (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 1, ""[O]ur postmodernist world is saturated with signs…that are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it.""  As Paragraph 2 notes, ""In Baudrillard's scheme, signs are subject to degeneration,"" detaching from any original or reality.  Therefore, such representations can be simulacra; however, the passage focuses on how simulacra now constitute our reality.
simulacra are more authentic than faithful counterfeits (Choice D).  In Baudrillardian theory, ""a carefully crafted counterfeit"" constitutes ""a faithful but identifiable copy.""  However, the sign tends to devolve ""into a less faithful copy"" until ""it no longer reflects or refers to reality"" but is instead ""pure simulation"" or ""the simulacrum"" (Paragraph 2).  According to one writer, simulation—and hence, the simulacrum—is ""'a creation of a new real by models that are not based on reality'"" (Paragraph 3).  Although this description suggests that simulacra may in a certain sense be more authentic than faithful counterfeits, it does not constitute the passage's central idea."
"348","The main point of Paragraph 1 is that:","B","62","Jorge Luis Borges' 1946 short story…plays with the well-known aphorism, ""The map is not the territory.""  In this paragraph-long fable, an empire's ambitious cartographers produce a map so spectacularly isomorphic it corresponds precisely in scale and detail with the kingdom it represents.  Perfect yet useless, the map is virtually indistinguishable from the landscape until it begins to decay….  Baudrillard cites Borges' tale as ""the finest allegory"" of his own provocative proposition that, in the current era, we have lost the ability to distinguish between reality and its representation.  Thus Baudrillard…postulates that ""it is no longer a question of either maps or territories""; rather, ""[s]omething has disappeared: the sovereign difference, between one and the other"" that, he laments, once ""constituted the charm of abstraction.""  Indeed, our postmodernist world is saturated with signs, symbols, and images that are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it.  Consequently…Baudrillard can assert that ""today it is the territory whose shreds slowly rot across the map.""  As he elaborates, ""[T]he territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it.""  Instead, ""[i]t is…the map that precedes the territory…that engenders the territory.""  In other words, representation can be seen to precede, produce, and ultimately surpass reality. (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, Borges' tale ""plays with the well-known aphorism (concise statement meant to relay a general truth), 'The map is not the territory,'"" implying that the two entities cannot be coequal or identical.  Borges' story further relates how ""an empire's ambitious cartographers (mapmakers) produce a map so spectacularly isomorphic (the same in form) it corresponds precisely in scale and detail with the kingdom it represents.""  However, such perfect correspondence with the territory means that the map is ""useless"" precisely because it is ""virtually indistinguishable from the landscape.""
Paragraph 1 then conveys how, ""in the current era, we have lost the ability to distinguish between reality and its representation.""  As Baudrillard explains, ""'[s]omething has disappeared: the sovereign (absolute) difference, between one and the other' that…once 'constituted the charm of abstraction.'""  Paragraph 1 also relays that ""our postmodernist world is saturated with signs…that are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it.""  Baudrillard illustrates this when he claims that ""'the territory no longer precedes the map,'"" thus indicating that reality no longer precedes representation, but instead ""representation can be seen to ""precede, produce, and ultimately surpass reality.""
Therefore, the main point of Paragraph 1 is that a representation must maintain a degree of difference from the original.
  (Choices A and C)  a map should be like a painting that accurately depicts the landscape; and a map's complexity is what renders it a practical tool.  Paragraph 1 relays Borges' story: ""[A]n empire's ambitious cartographers produce a map so spectacularly isomorphic it corresponds precisely in scale and detail with the kingdom it represents.""  However, such a map is ""[p]erfect yet useless"" because it ""is virtually indistinguishable"" from what it maps rather than being smaller in scale and simpler in detail.  Hence, if, as Paragraph 1 suggests, the map of an empire becomes too accurate and detailed, it is no longer useful.  Likewise, a map that is too complex is not practical as a tool.
(Choice D)  a map can never become as important as the territory.  Paragraph 1 conveys Borges' claim that our postmodern culture favors representation over reality.  As he sees it, ""'[T]he territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it.'""  Instead, ""'[i]t is…the map that precedes the territory…that engenders the territory.'""  The ultimate implication of such an emphasis on simulation is that ""representation can be seen to precede, produce, and ultimately surpass reality.""  Accordingly, Paragraph 1 presents the idea that a map can become not only as important, but even more important than the territory."
"349","Passage information would seem to suggest that postmodernist thought:","D","62","…Baudrillard—known as an extreme cultural relativist and often mocked as ""the high priest of postmodernism""—postulates that ""it is no longer a question of either maps or territories""; rather, ""[s]omething has disappeared: the sovereign difference, between one and the other""….  Indeed, our postmodernist world is saturated with signs, symbols, and images that are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it. (Paragraph 1)
In Baudrillard's scheme, signs are subject to degeneration….  In its penultimate phase, the representation no longer pretends to be the original but now instead pretends to be a copy; hence, it masks an absence of reality and erodes the distinction between the real and representation. (Paragraph 2)
As the supposed ""high priest of postmodernism,'"" Baudrillard claims that ""'the sovereign (absolute) difference'"" between forms of representation and of reality has disappeared.  Furthermore, the passage author suggests that Baudrillard believes ""our postmodernist world is saturated with signs…that are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it"" (Paragraph 1).
Paragraph 2 then elaborates on the diminishing difference between representation and reality:  ""In its penultimate (next to last) phase, the representation no longer pretends to be the original but now instead pretends to be a copy; hence, it masks an absence of reality and erodes the distinction between the real and representation.""  As Paragraph 3 emphasizes:  ""In Baudrillardian theory, when the distinction between representation and reality…disintegrates, the real disappears; we are left with copies of copies"" having no originals that constitute ""a 'hyperreality' of simulacra and simulation.""
Consequently, postmodernists, as exemplified by Baudrillard, seem to believe that the barriers between reality and representation have broken down.  Therefore, passage information would seem to suggest that postmodernist thought treats the boundaries between the real and the simulated as fluid.
  By contrast, passage information does not suggest that postmodernist thought:
inspires the creators of images to mislead society through media (Choice A).  Paragraph 1 describes how ""our postmodernist world is saturated with signs, symbols, and images that are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it.""  However, the passage never discusses the creators of images nor implies that media have been intentionally used to mislead society.
overlooks the complicating effects of mediation (Choice B).  In his supposed role as ""the high priest of postmodernism,"" Baudrillard comments: ""[s]omething has disappeared: the sovereign difference, between one and the other.'""  This is because ""our postmodernist world is saturated with signs, symbols, and images that are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it.""  In fact, Baudrillard sees mediation as so complicating our experience of reality that it replaces it.  As Baudrillard says, ""'[T]oday it is the territory whose shreds slowly rot across the map'"" (Paragraph 1).  Accordingly, passage information suggests that postmodernists focus on (rather than overlook) the complicating effects of mediation.
promotes forms of simulation as advantageous to society (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 1, ""[O]ur postmodernist world is saturated with signs…that are never neutral or transparent, but by mediating reality, come to construct it.  Consequently, in a sinister twist on the story, Baudrillard can assert that 'today it is the territory whose shreds slowly rot across the map.'""  By describing this scenario as ""sinister,"" the passage suggests that postmodernist thought views simulation as threatening rather than advantageous (beneficial) to society."
"350","Information in the passage suggests that the author would most likely NOT agree with which of the following assertions?","B","63","In Harvard Public Health Review, Kates and Hayward ask: ""Well intentioned though they may be, at what point do these taxes overstep government influence on an individual's right to autonomy in decision-making?  On whom does the increased financial burden of this taxation fall?"" (Paragraph 3)
As the goal of the taxes is to promote those lifestyle changes, the financial burden objection is a non-starter. (Paragraph 4)
Given this recognition, the question regarding autonomy constitutes a more substantial issue.  Nevertheless, that concern also rests on a dubious assumption, as people's autonomy is not necessarily respected in the current situation either….  Hence, by making healthy foods more affordable relative to unhealthy ones, government intervention might actually facilitate autonomous choices rather than hindering them. (Paragraph 5)
If so, that would suggest that members of these groups are being encouraged to persist in harmful dietary habits for the sake of corporate profits.  In that case, violating autonomy for the sake of health may be permissible, as that practice would be morally preferable to the present system of corporate exploitation. (Paragraph 6)
The author advocates price adjustments on foods to improve public health, but acknowledges that such adjustments could be seen as threatening citizens' autonomy.  For instance, Paragraph 3 quotes Kates and Hayward's concerns that taxing unhealthy foods might ""'overstep government influence on an individual's right to autonomy in decision-making'"" and that such taxes might also create an ""'increased financial burden'"" on people who cannot afford it.  Although the author describes the financial concern as ""a non-starter"" (Paragraph 4), they state that ""the question regarding autonomy constitutes a more substantial issue"" (Paragraph 5).
In addition, they then add that ""people's autonomy is not necessarily respected in the current situation either,"" and suggest that adjusting the prices of healthy and unhealthy foods ""might actually facilitate autonomous choices rather than hindering them.""  Paragraph 6 extends these ideas, as the author discusses whether people ""are being encouraged to persist in harmful dietary habits for the sake of corporate profits.""  If so, the author argues, then ""violating autonomy for the sake of health may be permissible, as that practice would be morally preferable to the present system of corporate exploitation.""
Accordingly, although the author does argue that violating people's autonomy ""may be permissible"" under some circumstances, they still treat preserving autonomy as an important consideration.  Therefore, based on passage information, the author would most likely NOT agree that preserving people's autonomy is of little concern when considering the good of society.
 (Choice A)  For people to make fully autonomous decisions, they need to be free from economic hardship.  According to Paragraph 5, a person's financial well-being may affect their autonomy: ""The fact that those of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to have poorer diets suggests that such persons' food choices are the result of financial constraint, not fully autonomous, rational deliberation.""  Thus, the author implies that economic hardship inhibits autonomous decision-making.
(Choice C)  People may be mistaken about what is in their own best interest.  Paragraph 6 discusses the possibility that ""the disproportionate consumption of unhealthy foods—and associated higher incidence of disease—among certain groups is…the result of those persons' perceived self-interest.""  Therefore, the author implies that people who ""persist in harmful dietary habits"" may mistakenly believe it is in their own best interest to do so, and would be better off if they understood the harm those habits actually cause them.
(Choice D)  When products are taxed, the financial burden typically falls on consumers.  Paragraph 2 describes Peñalvo et al.'s findings that ""'a 20% SSB [sugar-sweetened beverage] tax was estimated to reduce diabetes prevalence by 4% over 20 years.'""  Similarly, Paragraph 3 notes Kates and Hayward's observation that ""taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, for instance, 'are likely to have a greater impact on low-income individuals.'""  These remarks imply that when a product is taxed, consumers must pay more for them."
"351","The passage author mentions some of Kates and Hayward's words again in Paragraph 4 most likely in order:","A","63","In Harvard Public Health Review, Kates and Hayward ask: ""Well intentioned though they may be, at what point do these taxes overstep government influence on an individual's right to autonomy in decision-making?  On whom does the increased financial burden of this taxation fall?""  They note that taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, for instance, ""are likely to have a greater impact on low-income individuals…because individuals in those settings are more likely to be beholden to cost when making decisions about food."" (Paragraph 3)
However, ""well intentioned though they may be,"" the worries that Kates and Hayward express are to some extent misguided.  In particular, the idea that taxing unhealthy foods would burden those least able to afford it misses the point.  Although the increased taxes would affect anyone who continued to purchase the items despite the higher prices, the goal of raising prices on unhealthy foods is precisely to dissuade people from buying them. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 3 describes Kates and Hayward's concerns that, ""'[w]ell intentioned though they may be,'"" taxes on unhealthy foods might ""'overstep government influence on an individual's right to autonomy in decision-making'"" and lead to ""'increased financial burden'"" on persons of lower income.  Accordingly, they believe that although the proposal to adjust the prices of unhealthy foods comes from admirable motivations, it has problematic aspects.
However, in Paragraph 4, the author applies Kates and Hayward's description to their own concerns by writing: ""'well intentioned though they may be,' the worries that Kates and Hayward express are to some extent misguided.""  By repeating and emphasizing their own words in this way, the author implies that it is Kates and Hayward's position that comes from admirable motivations but has problematic aspects.  Consequently, the author mentions their words again to illustrate an irony in these researchers' concerns about proposed price adjustments.
 (Choice B)  to affirm these researchers' point that lower-income persons would benefit most from proposed price adjustments.  After repeating the phrase ""'well intentioned though they may be,'"" the author states that ""the worries that Kates and Hayward express are to some extent misguided.  In particular, the idea that taxing unhealthy foods would burden those least able to afford it misses the point.""  Therefore, the purpose of mentioning Kates and Hayward's words again is to argue against their position, even though the author does agree that ""'[t]hose in low-income environments may also be…most likely to benefit from such a lifestyle change indirectly posed by SSB taxes'"" (Paragraph 4).
(Choice C)  to argue that social class is irrelevant to evaluating proposed price adjustments.  In Paragraph 2, the author asserts that ""[t]he effects of price adjustments would be most pronounced on persons of lower socioeconomic status.""  Similarly, in Paragraph 5, the author writes: ""The fact that those of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to have poorer diets suggests that such persons' food choices are the result of financial constraint.""  Accordingly, the author indicates that social class is relevant to evaluating proposed price adjustments.
(Choice D)  to support these researchers' concerns about the effects of proposed price adjustments.  The author calls Kates and Hayward's concerns ""'well intentioned,'"" using those researchers' own words.  However, they also describe the concerns as ""to some extent misguided"" and state that ""[i]n particular, the idea that taxing unhealthy foods would burden those least able to afford it misses the point"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, the author's purpose in mentioning Kates and Hayward's words again is not to support their concerns."
"352","According to the author, a reason it might be legitimate for government interventions to violate some citizens' autonomy would be if implementing those interventions:","D","63","Because frequent consumption of unhealthy foods is strongly linked with cardiometabolic diseases, one way for governments to combat those afflictions may be to modify the eating habits of the general public.  Applying economic incentives or disincentives to various types of foods could potentially alter people's diets, leading to more positive health outcomes. (Paragraph 1)
Given this recognition, the question regarding autonomy constitutes a more substantial issue. (Paragraph 5)
If so, that would suggest that members of these groups are being encouraged to persist in harmful dietary habits for the sake of corporate profits.  In that case, violating autonomy for the sake of health may be permissible, as that practice would be morally preferable to the present system of corporate exploitation. (Paragraph 6)
A major theme of the passage is that governments can take steps to reduce cardiometabolic disease, but those steps might threaten citizens' ability to make their own dietary choices.  For instance, Paragraph 1 conveys that by raising the prices of unhealthy foods and lowering the prices of healthy foods, a government ""could potentially alter people's diets, leading to more positive health outcomes.""  However, the author acknowledges in Paragraph 5 that such an intervention might violate people's autonomy, noting that this ""question regarding autonomy constitutes a more substantial issue"" than concerns about the financial burden of price adjustments.
The author advocates such interventions despite that issue, arguing that ""violating autonomy for the sake of health may be permissible, as that practice would be morally preferable to the present system of corporate exploitation"" (Paragraph 6).  In other words, the author believes that while violating citizens' autonomy may be morally problematic, doing so to make people healthier is better than the alternative, which is letting corporations manipulate those citizens to increase profits.
Consequently, the author argues that a reason it might be legitimate for government interventions to violate some citizens' autonomy would be if implementing those interventions is less problematic than not implementing them.
 (Choice A)  is supported by the available research data.  According to the passage, research data supports the claim that price adjustments would help reduce cardiometabolic disease.  For example, a study by Peñalvo et al. found that ""increasing the prices of unhealthy foods such as processed meats and sugary sodas by 10%, while reducing the prices of healthy foods such as fruit and vegetables by 10%, would prevent an estimated 3.4% of yearly deaths in the U.S."" (Paragraph 2).  However, whether such steps would be effective in reducing disease is a separate question from whether it is legitimate to violate citizens' autonomy in order to achieve that goal.
(Choice B)  is supported by a majority of all citizens.  The author indicates that there is a ""disproportionate consumption of unhealthy foods—and associated higher incidence of disease—among certain groups"" (Paragraph 6).  However, they never discuss whether a majority of all citizens would support government interventions on food prices, nor suggest that such support would justify violating some citizens' autonomy.
(Choice C)  is aimed at citizens disproportionately affected by an issue.  The author states that ""[t]he effects of price adjustments would be most pronounced on persons of lower socioeconomic status"" (Paragraph 2).  They also discuss the ""disproportionate consumption of unhealthy foods—and associated higher incidence of disease—among certain groups"" (Paragraph 6).  However, the author does not justify violating citizens' autonomy based on that disproportionate impact.  Rather, they write that ""violating autonomy for the sake of health may be permissible, as that practice would be morally preferable to the present system of corporate exploitation"" (Paragraph 6)."
"353","The author argues that concern about the financial burden of taxes on unhealthy foods is misguided because:","C","63","In Harvard Public Health Review, Kates and Hayward ask: ""Well intentioned though they may be, at what point do these taxes overstep government influence on an individual's right to autonomy in decision-making?  On whom does the increased financial burden of this taxation fall?""  They note that taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, for instance, ""are likely to have a greater impact on low-income individuals…because individuals in those settings are more likely to be beholden to cost when making decisions about food."" (Paragraph 3)
However, ""well intentioned though they may be,"" the worries that Kates and Hayward express are to some extent misguided.  In particular, the idea that taxing unhealthy foods would burden those least able to afford it misses the point.  Although the increased taxes would affect anyone who continued to purchase the items despite the higher prices, the goal of raising prices on unhealthy foods is precisely to dissuade people from buying them….  As the goal of the taxes is to promote those lifestyle changes, the financial burden objection is a non-starter. (Paragraph 4)
According to the passage, governments could help prevent cardiometabolic disease by making healthy foods cheaper and unhealthy foods more expensive.  However, such price adjustments would most affect people of lower socioeconomic status, a fact that some researchers view as problematic.  For instance, Kates and Hayward ask: ""'On whom does the increased financial burden of this taxation fall?'""  They note that persons of lower income ""'are more likely to be beholden to cost when making decisions about food,'"" suggesting that taxing unhealthy foods may disproportionately impact people who already experience significant financial constraint (Paragraph 3).
The author then responds to this worry, stating that it is ""to some extent misguided.  In particular, the idea that taxing unhealthy foods would burden those least able to afford it misses the point,"" because ""the goal of raising prices on unhealthy foods is precisely to dissuade people from buying them"" (Paragraph 4).  Hence, the author argues that the taxes would not cause people to pay more for the same (unhealthy) foods, but rather that it would cause them to buy cheaper, healthier, foods instead.
Therefore, although it is true that lower-income persons would be most affected by the increased prices, that is not a drawback because the purpose of the price increase is to reduce consumption of unhealthy foods.  Consequently, the author argues that concern about the financial burden of taxes on unhealthy foods is misguided because the increased cost of those foods is designed to prevent people from buying them.
 (Choice A)  that burden is a less substantial issue than questions regarding autonomy.  Paragraph 4 states that ""the financial burden objection is a non-starter,"" and Paragraph 5 continues: ""Given this recognition, the question regarding autonomy constitutes a more substantial issue.""  Consequently, the author concludes that autonomy is a more substantial issue because concern about the financial burden is misguided; it is not the reason why that concern is misguided.
(Choice B)  the people most affected by price increases would also be most able to afford them.  Paragraph 2 states that ""[t]he effects of price adjustments would be most pronounced on persons of lower socioeconomic status.""  Likewise, Paragraph 3 cites Kates and Hayward's remark that ""taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, for instance, 'are likely to have a greater impact on low-income individuals.'""  Accordingly, the passage does not suggest that the people most affected by price increases would also be most able to afford them.
(Choice D)  the added expense of buying some foods would be offset by the reduced prices on others.  According to Paragraph 1, ""[a]pplying economic incentives or disincentives to various types of foods could potentially alter people's diets.""  Similarly, Paragraph 4 relates that ""the goal of raising prices on unhealthy foods is precisely to dissuade people from buying them.""  Therefore, the goal of the price adjustments is to inhibit the purchase of unhealthy foods, not to offset the expense of their continued purchase."
"354","Which of the following statements, if true, would most support the author's argument for price adjustments?","A","63","Peñalvo et al. concluded that such price adjustments would help to prevent deaths related to cardiometabolic diseases….  This data comports with that found in other countries, such as ""previous modeling studies in South Africa and India, where a 20% SSB [sugar-sweetened beverage] tax was estimated to reduce diabetes prevalence by 4% over 20 years.""  The effects of price adjustments would be most pronounced on persons of lower socioeconomic status, as the researchers ""found an overall 18.2% higher price-responsiveness for low versus high SES [socioeconomic status] groups."" (Paragraph 2)
As Kates and Hayward themselves remark, ""Those in low-income environments may also be the largest consumers of obesogenic foods and therefore most likely to benefit from such a lifestyle change indirectly posed by SSB taxes.""  As the goal of the taxes is to promote those lifestyle changes, the financial burden objection is a non-starter. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 2 cites data from Peñalvo et al. suggesting that ""price adjustments would help to prevent deaths related to cardiometabolic diseases"" in the United States.  According to the author, ""[t]his data comports with that found in other countries.""  In addition, they further convey that ""[t]he effects of price adjustments would be most pronounced on persons of lower socioeconomic status, as the researchers 'found an overall 18.2% higher price-responsiveness for low versus high SES [socioeconomic status] groups.'""
Accordingly, if a study conducted in Mexico reported higher price responsiveness among low-income groups, this would further support the claim that Peñalvo et al.'s data comports with data from other countries.  In addition, it would also support the claims that groups of lower socioeconomic status are more responsive to price changes, and therefore that ""'[t]hose in low-income environments may also be the…most likely to benefit from such a lifestyle change indirectly posed by SSB taxes'"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, this statement about a study conducted in Mexico would most support the author's argument for price adjustments.
 By contrast, none of the following statements would most support the author's argument for price adjustments:
Many corporations are willing to decrease prices to avoid losing customers (Choice B).  If corporations are willing to decrease prices to avoid losing customers, then a tax on unhealthy foods would not necessarily lead to increased prices for consumers.  In that case, ""the goal of raising prices on unhealthy foods…to dissuade people from buying them"" would be undermined (Paragraph 4).
Kates and Hayward are funded by a sugar-sweetened beverage corporation (Choice C).  The author describes Kates and Hayward's concerns as ""'well intentioned,'"" implying that the issues they raise are worth considering on the issues' own merits.  Accordingly, it would be important for the author's argument to address those concerns even if Kates and Hayward's motivations were called into question due to their source of funding.
Peñalvo et al. inferred people's socioeconomic status from their educational attainment (Choice D).  If Peñalvo et al. inferred socioeconomic status in their study instead of measuring it directly, their conclusions related to lower-income persons could potentially be called into question.  Since the author's claims about the price responsiveness of lower-income persons are based in part on Peñalvo et al.'s data, the author's argument could be weakened in this scenario."
"355","A government worries that if price adjustments on food are implemented, citizens' autonomy will be violated to an unacceptable degree.  Which recommendation represents the most reasonable compromise between the government's worry and the author's public health goals?","D","63","Peñalvo et al. concluded that such price adjustments would help to prevent deaths related to cardiometabolic diseases.  According to their analysis, increasing the prices of unhealthy foods such as processed meats and sugary sodas by 10%, while reducing the prices of healthy foods such as fruit and vegetables by 10%, would prevent an estimated 3.4% of yearly deaths in the U.S.  Changing prices by 30% would have an even stronger effect, preventing an estimated 9.2% of yearly deaths. (Paragraph 2)
In Harvard Public Health Review, Kates and Hayward ask: ""Well intentioned though they may be, at what point do these taxes overstep government influence on an individual's right to autonomy in decision-making?  On whom does the increased financial burden of this taxation fall?"" (Paragraph 3)
Although the increased taxes would affect anyone who continued to purchase the items despite the higher prices, the goal of raising prices on unhealthy foods is precisely to dissuade people from buying them. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 2, adjusting the costs of certain foods would help reduce deaths from cardiometabolic disease: ""[I]ncreasing the prices of unhealthy foods such as processed meats and sugary sodas by 10%, while reducing the prices of healthy foods such as fruit and vegetables by 10%, would prevent an estimated 3.4% of yearly deaths in the U.S.""  Based on this data, the author supports instituting such price adjustments as a way to improve public health.
This plan raises the question of whether such adjustments would ""overstep government influence on an individual's right to autonomy in decision-making'"" (Paragraph 3).  For instance, the author's ""goal of raising prices on unhealthy foods…to dissuade people from buying them"" (Paragraph 4) might be considered an unacceptable level of interference in people's decisions as consumers.
However, that objection would apply only to increasing prices on unhealthy foods, which attempts to alter people's diets by preventing them from buying certain foods even if they want to.  By contrast, lowering prices on healthy foods attempts to alter people's diets simply by making certain foods a more attractive choice.  Therefore, the most reasonable compromise between the government's worry and the author's public health goals would be to reduce prices on healthy foods without increasing prices on unhealthy foods.
 (Choice A)  Explain planned price adjustments to the public in advance of their implementation.  Explaining the plan for ""[a]pplying economic incentives or disincentives to various types of foods"" (Paragraph 1) in advance would inform the public about the price changes.  However, possessing that information would not mean that citizens had a choice about whether the price adjustments were implemented.  Therefore, such explanation would not eliminate the potential for violating citizens' autonomy.
(Choice B)  Use nutritional education to shift consumers toward healthier foods without price adjustments.  According to Paragraph 5, ""The fact that those of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to have poorer diets suggests that such persons' food choices are the result of financial constraint.""  Therefore, the passage suggests that people frequently buy unhealthy foods because of economics, not necessarily because they lack education.  Consequently, nutritional education would likely be less effective than providing an economic incentive to purchase healthy foods.
(Choice C)  Exclude sugar-sweetened beverages from price increases to reduce disproportionate impact on certain groups.  Paragraph 3 states that ""taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages…'are likely to have a greater impact on low-income individuals,'"" while Paragraph 4 conveys that ""the goal of raising prices on unhealthy foods is precisely to dissuade people from buying them.""  Therefore, excluding sugar-sweetened beverages from price increases to reduce disproportionate impact on certain groups would undermine the purpose of the proposed price adjustments."
"356","The passage author believes that ""we should not be overhasty"" when evaluating Sun Bin's ideas because:
His insights can provide people with guidance for achieving excellence in their endeavors.
His insights reflect more than a century of intellectual development in military strategy.
Sun Bin offers a deep and comprehensive system of thought.","C","64","Although some deem Sun Bin's thinking to lack the philosophical depth displayed by his predecessor, the two strategists in fact bear many similarities, and we should not be overhasty in our evaluation of Sun Bin's contribution. (Paragraph 1)
Nevertheless, his words apply far beyond a military perspective.  By situating warfare within ""the pattern of the heavens and the earth,"" Sun Bin conceives it as a microcosm of a larger and more abstract natural harmony.  To act in accordance with this harmony is to secure victory; to fail to do so is to ensure defeat.  Consequently, success in battle is achieved in the same way as success in any endeavor; as with the horse race, one must adapt to the natural propensities of a situation…As with Sun Tzu's more famous insights, however, the true depth and value of Sun Bin's thinking lie in its broader scope and application. (Paragraph 5)
The passage author argues that Sun Bin's writings are useful not only for military strategy, but also for pursuing other kinds of goals.  For example, Paragraph 5 asserts that ""his words apply far beyond a military perspective,"" and stresses his conception of warfare ""as a microcosm of a larger and more abstract natural harmony.""  The passage further highlights Sun Bin's belief that ""success in battle is achieved in the same way as success in any endeavor,"" and states that ""the true depth and value of Sun Bin's thinking lie in its broader scope and application.""  Therefore, the passage author believes that Sun Bin's insights can provide people with guidance for achieving excellence in their endeavors (Number I).
One theme of the passage is that the depth and comprehensiveness of Sun Bin's writings should be seen as comparable to those of Sun Tzu.  While ""some deem Sun Bin's thinking to lack the philosophical depth displayed by his predecessor,"" the passage author argues against this view, stating that ""we should not be overhasty in our evaluation of Sun Bin's contribution"" (Paragraph 1).  Similarly, the author argues that Sun Bin's military insights apply beyond the domain of warfare, and that ""the true depth and value of Sun Bin's thinking lie in its broader scope and application"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, the passage author believes that Sun Bin offers a deep and comprehensive system of thought (Number III).
 (Number II)  His insights reflect more than a century of intellectual development in military strategy.  Paragraph 1 states that it was ""one and a half centuries later"" (after the time of Sun Tzu) when ""his descendant Sun Bin…extended the discussion of battlefield tactics with his own insights.""  However, the author goes on to state that the ideas of Sun Tzu and Sun Bin ""in fact bear many similarities, and we should not be overhasty in our evaluation of Sun Bin's contribution.""  Therefore, the author's positive evaluation of Sun Bin's ideas is based on their similarity to Sun Tzu's ideas, not on the thought that they reflect more than a century of intellectual development."
"357","Which of the following individuals would be playing ""both general and soldier"" as described in the passage?","D","64","In one chapter, Sun Tzu gives the instruction to ""throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight.  If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve.""  The military application is obvious, but the underlying idea extends much further: when one cannot give up, there is no choice but to strive for victory with full abandon.  The question then becomes whether one can play both general and soldier, throwing oneself into the inescapable position that must be confronted. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 relates Sun Tzu's advice to ""throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and they will prefer death to flight.  If they will face death, there is nothing they may not achieve.""  The author claims such advice ""extends much further"" (ie, beyond the military context), noting that ""when one cannot give up, there is no choice but to strive for victory with full abandon.""  In other words, when people have no way of backing out of a situation, the only choice they have is to try to succeed with all their might.
The author then states that the question to be considered is ""whether one can play both general and soldier, throwing oneself into the inescapable position that must be confronted"" (Paragraph 4).  Thus, the author implies that people who play both general and soldier intentionally place themselves in an inescapable situation (as the general would) and then have no choice but to confront that situation and do everything possible to succeed (as the soldier would).
Accordingly, a poor student who spends all her money moving to a new city to pursue her dream of acting is the best example of this idea.  By spending all her money moving, she places herself in a situation where she cannot return to her old life and is left with no alternative but to wholeheartedly strive for success in fulfilling her dreams.
 By contrast, all of the following individuals play only the soldier and not the general:
A reckless driver who attends traffic school to avoid having his driver's license suspended (Choice A).  It cannot be assumed that the driver threatened to suspend his own license; rather, that threat would come from a court or other entity with the legal authority to impose such a suspension.  Accordingly, that entity would be the ""general"" in this scenario.
A struggling employee who works furiously to meet sales quotas to keep from being fired (Choice B).  The employee's situation would be caused by an employer (the ""general""), who sets the sales quotas and the consequence for not meeting them (ie, being fired).
An overweight man who refuses to eat unhealthy food in order to stick to the diet his doctor prescribed (Choice C).  Although the man makes the decision to refuse unhealthy food, his doctor would be the ""general"" in this scenario by prescribing the diet in the first place.  In addition, the man is not described as making himself unable to eat unhealthy food; rather, he could choose to break the diet if he changed his mind about following it.  Hence, he is not forced to confront an inescapable situation."
"358","Which of the following statements is most supported by evidence in the passage?","A","64","An instructive example can be found in a historical record of his advice to another commander concerning a horse race:
…Just as the contest was to begin, Sun Bin counseled Tian Ji, ""Pit your third-best team against their finest, your finest against their second-best, and your second best against their third.""  When all three horse races were finished, though Tian Ji had lost the first race, his horses prevailed in the next two, in the end winning a thousand pieces of the king's gold. (Paragraph 2)
Sun Bin's tactic essentially aligns with Sun Tzu's famous maxim: ""If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.""  Nothing had changed about the horses, but Sun Bin arranged their deployment in a way that ensured an overall victory.  Hence, the story is not out of place in a context of military tactics because it illustrates the adaptation of circumstance to one's advantage. (Paragraph 3)
In Paragraph 2, the author describes Sun Bin's ""advice to another commander concerning a horse race,"" which resulted in ""winning a thousand pieces of the king's gold.""  Although this advice does not directly refer to military strategy, the author points out that it ""essentially aligns with Sun Tzu's famous maxim: 'If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.'  Nothing had changed about the horses, but Sun Bin arranged their deployment in a way that ensured an overall victory"" (Paragraph 3).
This similarity between Sun Bin's horse race advice and Sun Tzu's maxim about battles is presented to justify the claim that ""the story is not out of place in a context of military tactics"" (Paragraph 3).  Therefore, passage evidence supports the statement that Sun Bin's horse race advice fits within a context of military tactics.
 (Choice B)  The name Sun Bin is generally unfamiliar to non-scholars.  Paragraph 1 states that Sun Bin is ""[m]uch less familiar to the layman (non-scholar)"" than Sun Tzu, whose name is ""readily recognized by scholars and non-scholars alike.""  However, the passage does not offer any evidence to support the claim that Sun Bin is unfamiliar to non-scholars, but seemingly takes its truth for granted.
(Choice C)  Sun Tzu's The Art of War remains of interest to the modern military mind.  In Paragraph 4, the author states that ""The Art of War remains of interest to the modern military mind.""  However, although the author states that ""[t]he military application"" of one of Sun Tzu's instructions is ""obvious,"" he or she does not provide any evidence or examples of modern-day interest in The Art of War.
(Choice D)  Sun Tzu's The Art of War is more often applied to politics than to military settings.  Paragraph 4 claims that ""while The Art of War remains of interest to the modern military mind, its study is even more often applied to non-martial contexts, such as commerce, politics, or simply how to live.""  However, the passage does not state that The Art of War is applied specifically to politics (or any particular area) more often than it is applied to military settings.  Moreover, the passage does not provide data concerning how frequently The Art of War is applied to any given context."
"359","According to the passage, studying Sun Tzu's The Art of War is useful for all of the following EXCEPT:","B","64","The name ""Sun Tzu"" is readily recognized by scholars and non-scholars alike; as the author of The Art of War, he is identifiable even to those who have never studied Chinese history or military strategy.  Much less familiar to the layman is his descendant Sun Bin, who one and a half centuries later (circa 350 BCE) extended the discussion of battlefield tactics with his own insights. (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, ""The name 'Sun Tzu' is readily recognized by scholars and non-scholars alike; as the author of The Art of War, he is identifiable even to those who have never studied Chinese history or military strategy.""  However, this statement refers only to scholars' familiarity with the name 'Sun Tzu'; it does not make any claim about gaining scholarly recognition (ie, being acknowledged for one's contribution to a particular field or discipline).  Moreover, neither scholars nor scholarship are discussed at any other point in the passage.  Therefore, the passage never suggests that studying The Art of War is useful for achieving scholarly recognition.
 By contrast, the passage specifically suggests that studying Sun Tzu's The Art of War is useful for all of the following:
Guiding life decisions (Choice A).  Paragraph 4 states that ""while The Art of War remains of interest to the modern military mind, its study is even more often applied to non-martial contexts, such as commerce, politics, or simply how to live.""  Therefore, the passage suggests that studying Sun Tzu's The Art of War is useful for guiding life decisions.
Exploring philosophical ideas (Choice C).  Paragraph 1 identifies Sun Tzu as ""the author of The Art of War.""  The passage then conveys that Sun Tzu's work has philosophical value in addition to its military applications, stating that ""some deem Sun Bin's thinking to lack the philosophical depth displayed by his predecessor (ie, Sun Tzu).""  Accordingly, the passage indicates that Sun Tzu's ideas in The Art of War possess philosophical depth, implying that studying them is useful for exploring philosophical ideas.
Acquiring wealth (Choice D).  The passage conveys that Sun Bin's tactic for ""winning a thousand pieces of the king's gold"" in a horse race (Paragraph 2) ""essentially aligns with Sun Tzu's famous maxim"" about winning battles in The Art of War (Paragraph 3).  Furthermore, Paragraph 4 states that ""while The Art of War remains of interest to the modern military mind, its study is even more often applied to non-martial contexts, such as commerce (ie, money-making enterprises).""  Therefore, the passage suggests that studying Sun Tzu's The Art of War is useful for acquiring wealth."
"360","Suppose historians conclude that some parts of The Art of War believed to have been written by Sun Tzu were actually written by Sun Bin at a later date.  If true, would this information support the author's argument?","D","64","The name ""Sun Tzu"" is readily recognized by scholars and non-scholars alike…Although some deem Sun Bin's thinking to lack the philosophical depth displayed by his predecessor, the two strategists in fact bear many similarities, and we should not be overhasty in our evaluation of Sun Bin's contribution. (Paragraph 1)
However, Sun Bin's tactic essentially aligns with Sun Tzu's famous maxim: ""If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles."" (Paragraph 3)
Ultimately, Sun Bin provides a compelling picture of battlefield tactics and strategy.  As with Sun Tzu's more famous insights, however, the true depth and value of Sun Bin's thinking lie in its broader scope and application. (Paragraph 5)
The passage author argues that Sun Bin's work is comparable to that of Sun Tzu, and thus that it should be esteemed more highly than it sometimes is.  Paragraph 1 states that ""we should not be overhasty in our evaluation of Sun Bin's contribution"" to military strategy, as his thinking ""bear[s] many similarities"" to that of the more highly regarded Sun Tzu.  These similarities are stressed throughout the passage.  For example, one of Sun Bin's tactics ""essentially aligns with Sun Tzu's famous maxim: 'If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles'"" (Paragraph 3).
Likewise, the author concludes by praising Sun Bin's ""compelling picture of battlefield tactics and strategy,"" drawing the comparison that ""[a]s with Sun Tzu's more famous insights, however, the true depth and value of Sun Bin's thinking lie in its broader scope and application"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, the point of the author's argument is that we should value Sun Bin's insights similarly to how we value those of Sun Tzu.
Accordingly, if parts of The Art of War believed to have been written by Sun Tzu were actually written by Sun Bin at a later date, this would mean that some of the praise given to Sun Tzu for The Art of War should be given to Sun Bin instead.  In that case, the author's argument that Sun Bin should be seen more favorably in comparison to Sun Tzu would be strengthened.
 (Choice A)  No, the author's argument would not be affected.  Paragraph 1 notes that ""some deem Sun Bin's thinking to lack the philosophical depth displayed by his predecessor (ie, Sun Tzu).""  However, the author contests this view, arguing that ""the two strategists in fact bear many similarities, and we should not be overhasty in our evaluation of Sun Bin's contribution.""  Therefore, the possibility that Sun Bin may have actually written some parts of The Art of War (the famous work attributed to Sun Tzu) would affect the author's argument: it would provide additional evidence for the similarity and comparable value of the two thinkers' ideas.
(Choices B and C)  No, the author's argument would be challenged; and No, the author's argument would be refuted.  If Sun Bin were the actual writer of some of the work believed to have been written by Sun Tzu, it would provide additional support for the author's claim that Sun Bin's military insights are of comparable value to those of Sun Tzu.  Consequently, the author's argument would be neither challenged nor refuted."
"361","The author's main point regarding the existence of the universe is that:","A","65","But the difference between for all we know and what is remains crucially important, because it forestalls a tendency to make scientific assertions from a perspective biased by human perception…. (Paragraph 3)
[T]hus, it should be clear that claims about the purpose of the universe rest on shaky ground.  In particular, we must be wary of inferences drawn from juxtaposing the existence of intelligent life with the genuinely improbable cosmological conditions that make such life possible. (Paragraph 4)
It is tempting to go beyond Zycinski's factual point to draw deep cosmological, teleological, and even theological conclusions.  But no such conclusions follow.  The reason why a life-sustaining universe exists is that if it did not, there would be no one to wonder why a life-sustaining universe exists.  This fact is a function not of purpose, but of pre-requisite. (Paragraph 5)
Thus, the seemingly low initial chance that such a universe would exist is not in itself indicative of a purpose to its existence. (Paragraph 6)
When discussing the existence of the universe, the author consistently cautions against drawing conclusions that go beyond the purely factual information.  For instance, Paragraph 3 warns about the ""tendency to make scientific assertions from a perspective biased by human perception.""  The author applies that warning to the idea that the universe has a purpose, arguing that ""claims about the purpose of the universe rest on shaky ground.  In particular, we must be wary of inferences drawn from juxtaposing the existence of intelligent life with the genuinely improbable cosmological conditions that make such life possible"" (Paragraph 4).
This theme is emphasized throughout the remainder of the passage.  Paragraph 5 asserts that ""it is tempting to…draw deep cosmological, teleological, and even theological conclusions"" based on the idea that the existence of life was unlikely to occur by chance.  The author argues that ""no such conclusions follow"" because if a life-sustaining universe did not exist, then ""there would be no one to wonder why a life-sustaining universe exists.  This fact is a function not of purpose, but of pre-requisite.""
Thus, the author asserts that the improbability of life existing is irrelevant to the question of whether life has a purpose, because it is only when life does exist that such a question can even be asked.  Accordingly, the author concludes that ""the seemingly low initial chance that such a universe would exist is not in itself indicative of a purpose to its existence"" (Paragraph 6).  Therefore, his or her main point regarding the existence of the universe is that facts about the universe do not justify inferences about its purpose.
  (Choice B)  the initial conditions of the universe should guide how we understand other facts about it.  Paragraph 6 asserts that ""the seemingly low initial chance that such a universe would exist is not in itself indicative of a purpose to its existence.""  Therefore, the author takes the view that the initial conditions of the universe should not guide how we understand other facts about it.
(Choice C)  facts about the universe are inevitably framed by biases of human perception.  Paragraph 3 asserts that ""the difference between for all we know and what is remains crucially important, because it forestalls a tendency to make scientific assertions from a perspective biased by human perception.""  Accordingly, although the author implies that humans have a tendency toward biased perception, he or she indicates that this tendency can be forestalled (prevented).  Consequently, the author implies that facts about the universe are not inevitably framed by biases of human perception.
(Choice D)  facts about the universe depend on a subjective understanding of probability.  Paragraph 1 describes ""a conceptual confusion between objective probability and subjective probability"" that ""leads to an erroneous conflation (ie, a mistaken mix) of genuine possibility with what is in fact merely personal ignorance of outcome.""  Therefore, the author indicates that a subjective understanding of probability leads to error in one's understanding of facts."
"362","Which of the following scenarios best exemplifies ""a conceptual confusion between objective probability and subjective probability"" (Paragraph 1), as the author describes it?","B","65","The idea of probability is frequently misunderstood, in large part because of a conceptual confusion between objective probability and subjective probability.  The failure to make this distinction leads to an erroneous conflation of genuine possibility with what is in fact merely personal ignorance of outcome.  An example will clarify. (Paragraph 1)
A standard die is rolled on a table, but the outcome of the roll is concealed.  Should an observer be asked the chance that a particular number was rolled—five, say—the natural response is 1/6.  However, this answer is incorrect.  To say there is a one-in-six chance that a five was rolled implies there is an equal chance that any of the other numbers were rolled.  But there is no equal chance, because the roll has already occurred.  Hence, the probability that the result of the roll is a five is either 100% or 0%, and the same is true for each of the other numbers. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 1 discusses ""a conceptual confusion between objective probability and subjective probability.""  According to the author, this kind of confusion consists in ""an erroneous conflation (ie, a mistaken mix) of genuine possibility with what is in fact merely personal ignorance of outcome.""  In other words, someone who is confused in this way does not know the result of an event that has already occurred, and mistakenly treats that result as still a matter of chance rather than a matter of fact.
For example, Paragraph 2 describes a situation in which ""[a] standard die is rolled on a table, but the outcome of the roll is concealed.""  In this case, a ""natural response"" about probability would be mistaken: ""To say there is a one-in-six chance that a five was rolled implies there is an equal chance that any of the other numbers were rolled.  But there is no equal chance, because the roll has already occurred.""  Thus, although a person might subjectively think of that chance as 1/6, he or she would be incorrect because, objectively, ""the probability that the result of the roll is a five is either 100% or 0%.""
Therefore, this type of confusion would be best exemplified by a scenario in which a law school graduate takes the bar exam, and while waiting for the results to be released she calculates how likely she is to pass.  Although subjectively the applicant does not know her results, her ignorance does not change the fact that, objectively, she has already either succeeded or failed.  Hence, whether she passed the bar exam has already been determined.
  By contrast, none of the following scenarios involves confusing one's lack of knowledge with an outcome remaining undetermined:
A researcher approximates the starting values for a computer simulation on population growth, runs the simulation twice, and is surprised to receive very different ending values each time (Choice A).  The researcher is not confused on account of ignorance of outcome.  Rather, he or she is confused by the differences between two known outcomes of the simulation.
A gambler counts the number of aces that have been dealt, determines how many are left in the deck, and then judges whether another ace will be dealt (Choice C).  Although this scenario involves probability (ie, the chance that an ace will be dealt), the result of future deals has not yet been determined.  Accordingly, the gambler's judgment does not treat an event that has already occurred as still a matter of chance.
A hiker views a weather report predicting clear skies for the day, but when she is rained on during her hike, she realizes the meteorologist had been wrong (Choice D).  The weather prediction was made in advance.  Therefore, even though that prediction turned out to be incorrect, the meteorologist's error was not due to ignorance of an outcome that had already taken place."
"363","Why does the author ask readers to ""imagine that the die has not six but six billion sides"" (Paragraph 5)?","B","65","It is tempting to go beyond Zycinski's factual point to draw deep cosmological, teleological, and even theological conclusions.  But no such conclusions follow.  The reason why a life-sustaining universe exists is that if it did not, there would be no one to wonder why a life-sustaining universe exists.  This fact is a function not of purpose, but of pre-requisite.  For instance, suppose again that a five was rolled on a die.  We now observe a five on its face, not because the five was ""meant to be"" but because one side of the die had to land face up.  Even if we imagine that the die has not six but six billion sides, that analysis is unaffected.  Yes, it was unlikely that any given value would be rolled, but some value had to be rolled.  That ""initial condition"" then set the parameters for what kind of events could possibly follow; in this case, the observation of the five. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, the fact that improbable conditions were necessary for the universe to support life makes it ""tempting to…draw deep cosmological, teleological, and even theological conclusions.""  However, the author argues that ""no such conclusions follow.""  Rather, he or she asserts that ""[t]he reason why a life-sustaining universe exists is that if it did not, there would be no one to wonder why a life-sustaining universe exists.  This fact is a function not of purpose, but of pre-requisite.""
The author clarifies this distinction between purpose and pre-requisite by imagining that a five was rolled on a die, writing: ""We now observe a five on its face, not because the five was 'meant to be' but because one side of the die had to land face up.""  However, this point remains true even if the die has ""not six but six billion sides.""  That is, even an extremely low initial probability that a five would be observed does not entail that there was purpose or meaning to rolling a five.
Consequently, the author asks readers to ""imagine that the die has not six but six billion sides"" to illustrate that the improbability of an event does not imply that its occurrence has meaning.
  (Choice A)  to explain the tendency for people to confuse objective probability and subjective probability.  Paragraph 1 states that ""probability is frequently misunderstood, in large part because of a conceptual confusion between objective probability and subjective probability.""  The author explains that tendency as a mistake made based on ""personal ignorance of outcome"" (ie, not knowing that something has occurred).  By contrast, the point of the die with ""six billion sides"" (Paragraph 5) is that the known outcome of an event was not necessarily ""meant to be"" just because it was highly unlikely to occur.
(Choice C)  to provide a counterpoint to the position advanced by Zycinski.  Paragraph 4 discusses ""the genuinely improbable cosmological conditions that make [intelligent] life possible,"" and refers to how ""Joseph Zycinski provides an instructive account of those conditions.""  Accordingly, Zycinski is cited to clarify passage ideas; the author never suggests that he or she is offering a counterpoint to Zycinski's position.
(Choice D)  to show that there is no larger purpose to the existence of the universe.  The author states that ""it is tempting to…draw deep cosmological, teleological, and even theological conclusions"" about the purpose of the universe, ""[b]ut no such conclusions follow"" (Paragraph 5).  However, the author never argues that there is not a larger purpose to the universe.  Rather, he or she asserts that ""the seemingly low initial chance that such a universe would exist is not in itself indicative of a purpose to its existence"" (Paragraph 6).  Therefore, the idea that there is no larger purpose to the universe is a more extreme view than the position the author takes in the passage."
"364","How could the author more clearly demonstrate the point that, in the die-rolling example, ""the probability that the result of the roll is a five is either 100% or 0%""?","C","65","The idea of probability is frequently misunderstood, in large part because of a conceptual confusion between objective probability and subjective probability.  The failure to make this distinction leads to an erroneous conflation of genuine possibility with what is in fact merely personal ignorance of outcome.  An example will clarify. (Paragraph 1)
A standard die is rolled on a table, but the outcome of the roll is concealed.  Should an observer be asked the chance that a particular number was rolled—five, say—the natural response is 1/6.  However, this answer is incorrect.  To say there is a one-in-six chance that a five was rolled implies there is an equal chance that any of the other numbers were rolled.  But there is no equal chance, because the roll has already occurred.  Hence, the probability that the result of the roll is a five is either 100% or 0%, and the same is true for each of the other numbers. (Paragraph 2)
In Paragraph 1, the author describes a ""conceptual confusion"" about probability, based on ""an erroneous conflation (ie, a mistaken mix) of genuine possibility with what is in fact merely personal ignorance of outcome.""  Thus, with this type of confusion, people mistakenly treat their own lack of knowledge as if it meant that an event's outcome is still undetermined.
Paragraph 2 illustrates this error by using an example about die-rolling: ""A standard die is rolled on a table, but the outcome of the roll is concealed.""  According to the author, ""Should an observer be asked the chance that a particular number was rolled—five, say—the natural response is 1/6.  However, this answer is incorrect…because the roll has already occurred.  Hence, the probability that the result of the roll is a five is either 100% or 0%.""
Accordingly, this point would be made obvious by allowing observers to see the result of the die roll instead of concealing it.  In that case, the observers would have no reason to think there is a 1/6 chance that a five was rolled.  Instead, they would simply see the die and know whether that probability is 100% or 0%.  But in this version of the scenario, nothing has changed about the die roll itself; the only difference is that the observers are no longer ignorant of its outcome.  Consequently, this change would more clearly demonstrate that the probability a five was rolled is either 100% or 0%.
  (Choices A and D)  Allowing multiple rolls to be made in order to give repeated results; and Allowing observers to predict the probability of a five being rolled before the die roll is actually made.  The author's point is that once a die roll has occurred, it is no longer a matter of chance what the outcome is.  Thus, after the roll has been made, the probability of having rolled a five is either 100% or 0%, and the ""natural response"" of 1/6 represents a mistake in reasoning (Paragraph 2).  However, this point is not based on taking data from multiple results; rather, it applies to each die roll individually.  Similarly, since the author is discussing rolls that have already taken place, predicting the probability of an outcome before the roll occurs would not affect his or her claims.  Accordingly, neither of these possibilities would more clearly demonstrate the author's point about probability.
(Choice B)  Allowing a die with more than six sides to be used for the roll.  According to Paragraph 2, ""Should an observer be asked the chance that a particular number was rolled…the natural response is 1/6.  However, this answer is incorrect…. because the roll has already occurred.""  Thus, the incorrectness of the response is not based on the number of sides on the die, but rather on the fact that the result of the roll has already been determined. Therefore, using a die with more than six sides would have no impact in demonstrating the author's point."
"365","Based on the passage, with which of the following statements would the author most likely agree?","A","65","It is tempting to go beyond Zycinski's factual point to draw deep cosmological, teleological, and even theological conclusions.  But no such conclusions follow.  The reason why a life-sustaining universe exists is that if it did not, there would be no one to wonder why a life-sustaining universe exists.  This fact is a function not of purpose, but of pre-requisite. (Paragraph 5)
Similarly, the existence of intelligent beings is evidence that certain physical laws obtained in the universe.  However, it is not evidence that those beings or laws were necessary or intended rather than essentially random.  The subjective probability of that outcome is irrelevant, because in this universe the objective probability of its occurrence is 100%.  Thus, the seemingly low initial chance that such a universe would exist is not in itself indicative of a purpose to its existence. (Paragraph 6)
In Paragraph 5, the author asserts: ""The reason why a life-sustaining universe exists is that if it did not, there would be no one to wonder why a life-sustaining universe exists.  This fact is a function not of purpose, but of pre-requisite.""  Hence, the author implies that the existence of life does not justify inferences about the purpose of life.
Likewise, Paragraph 6 conveys that ""the existence of intelligent beings is evidence that certain physical laws obtained (came to be) in the universe.  However, it is not evidence that those beings or laws were necessary or intended rather than essentially random.""  Thus, the author indicates that intelligent life might have developed by chance and is not necessarily a sign that such life has a greater meaning.
Consequently, the author would most likely agree with the statement: Some things must simply be accepted.  This claim accords with the author's view that the existence of intelligent life may be merely a fact to be acknowledged, rather than something to be interpreted as a sign of meaning.
  (Choice B)  Math is the only universal language.  Although the author discusses ""[t]he idea of probability"" (ie, a part of mathematics) (Paragraph 1) throughout the passage, he or she never discusses language or communication.  Therefore, it cannot be inferred from the passage whether the author would agree with this statement.
(Choice C)  God does not play dice.  The passage alludes to God by mentioning the ""temptation to draw deep…theological conclusions,"" but the author argues that ""no such conclusions follow"" (Paragraph 5).  More importantly, however, Paragraph 6 states that ""the existence of intelligent beings…is not evidence that those beings or laws were necessary or intended rather than essentially random.""  Therefore, the author implies that features of the universe may have come about randomly or, metaphorically speaking, as a result of God ""playing dice.""
(Choice D)  Everything happens for a reason.  Paragraph 6 conveys that ""the existence of intelligent beings is evidence that certain physical laws obtained in the universe.  However, it is not evidence that those beings or laws were necessary or intended rather than essentially random.""  By asserting that some things in the universe may not have been intended, the author implies that there may be no greater purpose behind their existence.  Consequently, the author would reject the idea that everything happens for a reason."
"366","Given the information in the passage, with which of the following statements about the quote from Joseph Zycinski would the author be most likely to agree?","D","65","[T]hus, it should be clear that claims about the purpose of the universe rest on shaky ground.  In particular, we must be wary of inferences drawn from juxtaposing the existence of intelligent life with the genuinely improbable cosmological conditions that make such life possible.  Joseph Zycinski provides an instructive account of those conditions: ""If twenty billion years ago the rate of expansion were minimally smaller, the universe would have entered a stage of contraction at a time when temperatures of thousands of degrees were prevalent and life could not have appeared.  If the distribution of matter were more uniform the galaxies could not have formed.  If it were less uniform, instead of the presently observed stars, black holes would have formed from the collapsing matter.""  In short, the existence of life (let alone intelligent life) depends upon the initial conditions of the universe having conformed to an extremely narrow range of possible values. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, the development of life in the universe depended on a number of ""genuinely improbable cosmological conditions that make such life possible.""  The author refers to a quote from Joseph Zycinski, describing it as ""an instructive account"" of those conditions.  For instance, Zycinski explains that ""'[i]f twenty billion years ago the rate of expansion were minimally smaller, the universe would have entered a stage of contraction at a time when temperatures of thousands of degrees were prevalent and life could not have appeared.'""
The author then summarizes Zycinski's words in more general terms, stating: ""In short, the existence of life (let alone intelligent life) depends upon the initial conditions of the universe having conformed to an extremely narrow range of possible values"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, the author uses Zycinski's quote to convey a more specific and in-depth description of the narrow conditions necessary for life to exist, adding explanatory details to the author's more general point.  Therefore, the author would most likely agree that the quote provides clarifying information about those conditions.
  (Choice A)  It explains objective and subjective probability.  According to Paragraph 4, Zycinski's quote helps explain the ""genuinely improbable cosmological conditions that make [intelligent] life possible.""  However, it does not provide any information to explain the difference between ""objective probability and subjective probability"" (Paragraph 1) described in the passage.
(Choice B)  It exaggerates the point in question.  The author uses Zycinski's quote to describe the ""extremely narrow range of possible values"" necessary for life to exist in the universe, calling that quote ""an instructive account of those conditions"" (Paragraph 4).  Similarly, he or she then refers to ""Zycinski's factual point"" (Paragraph 5), implying that the quote correctly describes the ""low initial chance that such a universe would exist"" (Paragraph 6).  Given these descriptions, the author appears to view Zycinski's quote as informative and accurate, not as an exaggeration.
(Choice C)  It entails an erroneous conclusion.  In Paragraph 5, the author warns that ""[i]t is tempting to go beyond Zycinski's factual point to draw deep cosmological, teleological, and even theological conclusions.  But no such conclusions follow.""  Accordingly, the author does not suggest that Zycinski's quote entails an erroneous conclusion.  Rather, he or she indicates that some people wrongly draw conclusions that do not follow from Zycinski's quote."
"367","Based on the author's discussion of Leonardo's letter of application to Duke Ludovico Sforza, one can infer that:","D","66","In 1482, a thirty-year-old Leonardo da Vinci left his art studio in Florence and traveled to Milan to seek employment at the court of Duke Ludovico Sforza.  A drafted letter of application to the duke detailed Leonardo's many useful skills, the majority of which concerned military developments such as ""methods for destroying any fortress"" and making ""unassailable armored chariots.""  Peacetime talents such as ""guiding water from one place to another"" or producing ""sculpture in marble, bronze and clay"" were mentioned only at the end of the letter. (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, Leonardo's drafted letter to Sforza ""detailed Leonardo's many useful skills, the majority of which concerned military developments such as 'methods for destroying any fortress' and making 'unassailable armored chariots.'  Peacetime talents such as 'guiding water from one place to another' or producing 'sculpture in marble, bronze and clay' were mentioned only at the end of the letter.""
This emphasis on military developments suggests that Leonardo thought skills in this area would be useful to Sforza.  Accordingly, it is reasonable to infer that Leonardo believed it was likely that Milan would face war, which would make military innovation valuable to Sforza.
(Choice A)  Although the passage author calls the portable bridge ""one of the most intriguing items"" in Leonardo's letter (Paragraph 1), the passage never suggests that Sforza had a particular interest in bridges.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 2 indicates that ""[m]odern scholars question whether most of the devices mentioned in Leonardo's letter could really have been constructed.""  For example, ""Krull describes the fact that Leonardo never sent the letter as 'a good thing, as it was mostly bluff.'""  Similarly, Isaacson states that Leonardo's ""boasts were aspirational.""  Therefore, the passage suggests that Leonardo's ideas were not ready to be put into practice.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 3 states that ""[a]ccording to at least one account, Leonardo really did make such a bridge for Sforza,"" suggesting that Leonardo did work for the duke at some point."
"368","The author most likely discusses the ""challenge"" in building Leonardo's bridge in order to:","B","66","Despite the relative ease of constructing the bridge, there is one challenge: building it requires access to both sides of the region to be crossed, as well as the area in between.  Such a consideration might seem obvious in building any bridge, but it can still prove problematic.…  Leonardo may have confronted that problem as well and considered how to make a bridge that was not only portable and freestanding, but constructible in sequence from one end to the other. (Paragraph 6)
In Paragraph 6, the author states that ""[d]espite the relative ease of constructing the bridge, there is one challenge: building it requires access to both sides of the region to be crossed, as well as the area in between.""  This means that some of the bridge builders may have to stand in the water or even ""lack a place to stand"" altogether.
The discussion of this issue leads directly into speculation that ""Leonardo may have confronted that problem as well and considered how to make a bridge that was not only portable and freestanding, but constructible in sequence from one end to the other"" (Paragraph 6).  Therefore, the author discusses the bridge's ""challenge"" in order to raise the possibility that Leonardo later worked on a more refined version of the bridge.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 2 states that ""[m]odern scholars question whether most of the devices mentioned in Leonardo's letter could really have been constructed.  For instance, Krull describes the fact that Leonardo never sent the letter as 'a good thing, as it was mostly bluff'….  Regarding the bridge, however, there is no doubt that the design is workable.""  Therefore, although Krull does take the view that Leonardo's claims about his inventions outpaced his capacity to build them, the author asserts that the bridge is an exception to that view as no one doubts it is a workable design.
(Choice C)  The author states that it ""might seem obvious in building any bridge"" that constructing it ""requires access to both sides of the region to be crossed, as well as the area in between"" (Paragraph 6).  This statement indicates that access to both sides of a region is necessary for construction of all bridges, including Leonardo's.  Therefore, the mention of the challenge is not meant to suggest that Leonardo's bridge is harder to construct than a conventional (standard) bridge.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 3 notes that Leonardo's bridge ""can be assembled by a mere handful of people, and even some children could potentially build a small version or model,"" indicating that it is usually simple to construct.  Hence, although the ""challenge"" is presented in contrast to ""the relative ease of constructing the bridge"" (Paragraph 6), the passage portrays Leonardo's instructions as generally easy (not difficult) to understand."
"369","Based on passage information, the author's primary reason for believing that the portable bridge is a workable design is that:","B","66","Modern scholars question whether most of the devices mentioned in Leonardo's letter could really have been constructed….  Regarding the bridge, however, there is no doubt that the design is workable. (Paragraph 2)
According to at least one account, Leonardo really did make such a bridge for Sforza.  More significantly, examples of the bridge have been built and used in contemporary times. (Paragraph 3)
The author states that ""there is no doubt that the [bridge's] design is workable"" (Paragraph 2) and goes on to explain: ""According to at least one account, Leonardo really did make such a bridge for Sforza.  More significantly, examples of the bridge have been built and used in contemporary times"" (Paragraph 3).  This statement indicates that the author's primary reason for believing that the portable bridge is a workable design is that it has served as the model design for some present-day bridges.
By contrast, none of the following is the primary reason why the author believes that the portable bridge is a workable design:
Leonardo is said to have really built such a bridge on at least one occasion (Choice A).  The author indicates that ""[a]ccording to at least one account, Leonardo really did make such a bridge for Sforza.""  However, the author then states that ""[m]ore significantly, examples of the bridge have been built and used in contemporary times,"" asserting the primary reason for his or her belief that the bridge is a workable design (Paragraph 3).
it was a realistic and practical idea, unlike Leonardo's more fanciful military designs (Choice C).  Although Leonardo's military designs may have been more fanciful than the bridge, the author's primary reason for believing that the bridge was workable is the examples of it ""built and used in contemporary times"" (Paragraph 3), rather than a comparison with Leonardo's other, ""aspirational"" ideas (Paragraph 2).
its construction is based on the repetition of a modular structure (Choice D).  Paragraph 5 states that the bridge's ""design is modular and repeatable.""  However, the author's primary reason for believing the design to be workable is that ""examples of the bridge have been built and used in contemporary times"" (Paragraph 3)."
"370","Which of the following changes to Leonardo's design would most likely prevent the production of a stable bridge?","C","66","When the bridge is constructed correctly, each component helps to hold all the other components in place.  The original sketch calls for the beams to be notched so that the pieces of the bridge lock together.  However, in some cases this feature can be omitted, provided the wood is sufficiently rough.  This version of the bridge then stands and bears weight due to friction, gravity, and the physical integrity of the pieces.  In this way, the structure depends entirely on the interplay of physical forces upon its parts. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, Leonardo's original bridge design ""calls for the beams to be notched so that the pieces of the bridge lock together.""  However, ""in some cases this feature can be omitted, provided the wood is sufficiently rough.""  In those cases, the bridge ""stands and bears weight due to friction, gravity, and the physical integrity of the pieces.""  Accordingly, the passage indicates that if the beams of the bridge are not notched, they must at least be made of sufficiently rough wood.
Therefore, using wood that is smooth and lacks notches would be the change to Leonardo's design most likely to prevent the production of a stable bridge.  If the wood is not rough, there would be nothing to compensate for the lack of notches that would otherwise hold the beams in place.
By contrast, none of the following changes to Leonardo's design would be likely to prevent the production of a stable bridge:
Using unskilled labor in its assembly (Choice A).  Paragraph 3 states that ""the bridge can be assembled by a mere handful of people, and even some children could potentially build a small version or a model.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that unskilled labor is sufficient for assembling the bridge.
Using beams of multiple lengths (Choice B).  Paragraph 3 describes Leonardo's design for the bridge, ""which includes different sets of wooden beams cut to specific lengths.""  Therefore, the bridge building instructions explicitly call for the use of beams of multiple lengths.
Using nails and tools during construction (Choice D).  Constructing the bridge requires ""no nails, ropes, or other fasteners, nor any tools"" (Paragraph 3).  Although nails and tools are not required, the passage never suggests that using them would diminish the bridge's stability.  (If anything, it is more likely that joining the pieces of the bridge together with tools and nails would reinforce it.)"
"371","Which of the following assertions would most strongly challenge one of the claims made by the author?","D","66","Modern scholars question whether most of the devices mentioned in Leonardo's letter could really have been constructed.  For instance, Krull describes the fact that Leonardo never sent the letter as ""a good thing, as it was mostly bluff.""  Isaacson, though a bit more charitable, similarly declares that Leonardo's ""boasts were aspirational.""  Regarding the bridge, however, there is no doubt that the design is workable. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 states that ""[m]odern scholars question whether most of the devices mentioned in Leonardo's letter could really have been constructed.""  The author cites the examples of Krull, who ""describes the fact that Leonardo never sent the letter as 'a good thing, as it was mostly bluff,'"" as well as Isaacson, who ""similarly declares that Leonardo's 'boasts were aspirational.'""
Hence, the passage depicts scholars as believing that most of the devices mentioned in Leonardo's letter (with the exception of the bridge) could not have been constructed.  Consequently, the assertion that historians believe that Leonardo could have built most of the devices described in his letter would most strongly challenge one of the author's claims.
(Choice A)  According to Paragraph 2, ""[m]odern scholars question whether most of the devices mentioned in Leonardo's letter could really have been constructed.""  This suggests that some of Leonardo's ideas for inventions would not actually work in practice.  Therefore, it would be consistent with passage information if a modern engineering team could not make a working version of a siege weapon designed by Leonardo.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 1 states that the ""letter of application to the duke detailed Leonardo's many useful skills, the majority of which concerned military developments.""  Accordingly, if Leonardo thought that the bridge would mainly be useful for traveling soldiers, that would be consistent with passage information (ie, it would not pose a challenge) by classifying the bridge with the military developments in the letter.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 3 states that ""[a] sketch in one of Leonardo's notebooks illustrates the bridge's construction.""  However, the passage never indicates that all of Leonardo's notebooks contain such a sketch.  Therefore, the assertion that some of Leonardo's notebooks do not mention the portable bridge would not challenge the author's claims."
"372","Some scholars believe that although Leonardo was a skilled painter, he had lost interest in painting by the time he traveled to Milan.  Is passage information consistent with this claim?","C","66","In 1482, a thirty-year-old Leonardo da Vinci left his art studio in Florence and traveled to Milan to seek employment at the court of Duke Ludovico Sforza.  A drafted letter of application to the duke detailed Leonardo's many useful skills, the majority of which concerned military developments such as ""methods for destroying any fortress"" and making ""unassailable armored chariots.""  Peacetime talents such as ""guiding water from one place to another"" or producing ""sculpture in marble, bronze and clay"" were mentioned only at the end of the letter. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 states that when Leonardo ""traveled to Milan to seek employment at the court of Duke Ludovico Sforza,"" he promoted himself with a list of skills, ""the majority of which concerned military developments such as 'methods for destroying any fortress' and making 'unassailable armored chariots.'""  By contrast, ""[p]eacetime talents such as 'guiding water from one place to another' or producing 'sculpture in marble, bronze and clay' were mentioned only at the end of the letter.""
As such, the passage depicts Leonardo as emphasizing his engineering skills, while focusing less on his artistic talents.  This emphasis on engineering over art would therefore be consistent with the idea that Leonardo had lost interest in painting by the time he traveled to Milan.
(Choice A)  The passage describes some of the topics included in Leonardo's letter, ""such as 'methods for destroying any fortress' and…producing 'sculpture in marble, bronze and clay'"" (Paragraph 1).  However, these are only a few examples of the topics in the letter, and the passage never indicates whether Leonardo mentioned painting.  Hence, a loss of interest in painting cannot be inferred on this basis; Leonardo may in fact have mentioned painting in his letter.
(Choice B)  According to Paragraph 2, Krull describes Leonardo's claims about constructing ""the devices mentioned in [his] letter"" as ""mostly bluff,"" while Isaacson describes those claims as ""boasts"" that were ""aspirational.""  However, neither scholar makes any claims about Leonardo's artistic skills (nor suggests anything about his level of interest in painting) within the passage.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 3 states that a ""sketch in Leonardo's notebooks illustrates the bridge's construction,"" indicating that its purpose was to show how the bridge is assembled.  Therefore, the inclusion of the sketch with the bridge instructions would not necessarily suggest that artistic endeavors had remained important to Leonardo."
"373","The author most likely alludes to Archimedes (Paragraph 6) in order to:","D","66","Despite the relative ease of constructing the bridge, there is one challenge: building it requires access to both sides of the region to be crossed, as well as the area in between.  Such a consideration might seem obvious in building any bridge, but it can still prove problematic.  If a bridge is meant to help cross a body of water, not all members of the group attempting to cross will receive its benefit, as some would have to stand in the water during the bridge's construction.  Of course, this assumes that it is safe to enter the water in the first place.  Crossing a chasm or a deep pit would pose even greater difficulties, as the bridge's prospective builders would, like the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes, lack a place to stand. (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 6 describes a challenge when building Leonardo's bridge, namely, that ""building it requires access to both sides of the region to be crossed, as well as the area in between.""  As such, ""[i]f the bridge is meant to help cross a body of water, not all members of the group attempting to cross will receive its benefit, as some would have to stand in the water during the bridge's construction.""  The author further elaborates that ""[c]rossing a chasm or a deep pit would pose even greater difficulties, as the bridge's prospective builders would, like the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes, lack a place to stand.""
The mention of Archimedes draws attention to the similarity between a situation that Archimedes discussed (historically) and one that prospective bridge builders could encounter (ie, having no place to stand).  However, that does not provide any further clarification of the challenge being described.  Therefore, the author most likely alludes to Archimedes in the passage merely in order to make a historical reference.
By contrast, the author does not most likely allude to Archimedes in order to:
introduce an additional challenge of the bridge (Choice A).  The reference to Archimedes does not discuss an additional challenge of the bridge.  Rather, it continues the discussion of the identified challenge that ""building [the bridge] requires access to both sides of the region to be crossed, as well as the area in between"" (Paragraph 6).
incorporate Greek ideas (Choice B).  Although Archimedes was an ""ancient Greek mathematician"" (Paragraph 6), the author does not discuss his ideas, nor incorporate ideas from Greek individuals into the passage.
compare him to Leonardo (Choice C).  Paragraph 6 states that when trying to cross a chasm or deep pit, ""the bridge's prospective builders would, like…Archimedes, lack a place to stand.""  Therefore, the author compares Archimedes to the prospective bridge builders.  However, the author never draws a comparison between Archimedes and Leonardo."
"374","The author's claim that a prospective bride faces a ""dilemma of symbolic identity"" (Paragraph 2) suggests that:","B","67","Law professor Elizabeth Emens notes that although cases such as Kruzel v Podell and Dunn v Palermo established in 1975 that a married woman may legally decline to become ""Mrs. His Name"" (a term used by psychologist Jean M. Twenge), it is still customary for children's surnames to be conferred patrilinearly.  Hence, a prospective bride faces a dilemma of symbolic identity; she may either retain her nominal connection to her parents and past self or create a nominal connection to her husband and future children. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 states that although ""a married woman may legally decline to become 'Mrs. His Name'…it is still customary for children's surnames to be conferred patrilinearly (ie, according to the father's surname).""  Therefore, when deciding which surname to use after marriage, ""a prospective bride faces a dilemma of symbolic identity; she may either retain her nominal connection to her parents and past self or create a nominal connection to her husband and future children.""  By contrast, ""'her husband has the same name as his parents and his child and thus continuity across all three generations of his family.'""
Thus, the passage indicates that a married woman has two aspects to her social identity (connection to her parents and connection to her husband and children), but her choice of surname publicly expresses only one of those aspects.  Therefore, the author's claim that a prospective bride faces a ""dilemma of symbolic identity"" (Paragraph 2) suggests that a woman's social identity cannot be fully expressed once she marries.
  (Choice A)  a prospective bride loses her identity upon marriage.  The passage indicates that a prospective bride's ""dilemma of symbolic identity"" forces her to choose between using a name that represents a ""connection to her parents and past self"" or one that represents a ""connection to her husband and future children"" (Paragraph 2).  Therefore, the passage does not indicate that a bride loses her identity upon marriage; rather, she loses the ability to fully express both aspects of her identity.
(Choice C)  traditional naming practices help to resolve issues surrounding identity.  Paragraph 2 states that ""it is still customary for children's surnames to be conferred patrilinearly,"" which is partially why ""a prospective bride faces a dilemma of symbolic identity.""  Therefore, traditional naming practices help to create issues surrounding identity rather than to resolve them.
(Choice D)  it is more complicated to choose one's social identity than one's legal identity.  According to Paragraph 2, a prospective bride's choice of her married surname will ""either retain her nominal connection to her parents and past self or create a nominal connection to her husband and future children.""  Accordingly, the passage indicates that by choosing which legal name to use, a bride simultaneously chooses which social identity to express.  Therefore, the author does not imply that it is more complicated to choose one's social identity than one's legal identity; he or she implies that by choosing her legal name, a bride also chooses her social identity."
"375","In some modern marriages, a prospective bride and groom will both change their names to a new, shared surname.  How does this practice affect the arguments presented in the passage?","B","67","In a 1996 Good Housekeeping article, Peggy Noonan advocates for the value of name changing as reflecting the couple's commitment to marriage….  Noonan goes on to suggest that ""for these brides, taking their husbands' names is a declaration not only of intention, but of faith…faith in yourself and your spouse.""  Noonan ends her article by applauding the trend of more couples choosing to share a married surname. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, ""Peggy Noonan advocates for the value of name changing as reflecting the couple's commitment to marriage,"" suggesting that a bride demonstrates ""'faith in [herself] and [her] spouse'"" by sharing a name with her husband.  Similarly, Noonan ""ends her article by applauding the trend of more couples choosing to share a married surname.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that Noonan values commitment to marriage and sees sharing a married surname as demonstrating such a commitment.
Accordingly, although Noonan specifically discusses women changing their names, her support for that practice is based on the idea that a couple's commitment to each other is more important than the ""freedom and self-actualization"" represented by retaining one's original name (Paragraph 4).  Thus, if a prospective bride and groom both changed their names to a new, shared surname upon marriage, that decision would suggest that they were each demonstrating a commitment to their marriage through this choice, consistent with Noonan's values.  Therefore, that practice would support Noonan's claims about the importance of commitment to marriage.
  (Choice A)  It reduces the relevance of Noonan's claims about the importance of marital commitment.  Paragraph 4 states that Peggy Noonan ""ends her article by applauding the trend of more couples choosing to share a married surname,"" which she claims signifies their commitment to marriage.  If some modern brides and grooms both change their names to a new, shared surname, that fact would support the continuing relevance of Noonan's claims about the importance of marital commitment.
(Choice C)  It undermines Snyder's objection to Laura Dawn Lewis' position.  Paragraph 5 implies that Laura Dawn Lewis makes an argument ""equating commitment to marriage with a woman's willingness to change her name.""  However, Kelly Snyder objects to Lewis' argument because ""'[i]t is unclear why these [reasons] should explain a woman's choice to change her name, but not a man's.'""  If a prospective bride and groom both changed their names to a new, shared surname upon marriage, they would both be demonstrating their commitment.  Therefore, this situation would support (not undermine) Snyder's objection to Lewis' position.
(Choice D)  It exemplifies Emens' claims regarding marital naming disparities.  Emens suggests that a woman is disadvantaged by marital naming tradition because ""'there is no realistic possibility of him [her husband] or both changing' to create a shared surname"" (Paragraph 5).  If a prospective bride and groom both changed their names to a new, shared surname upon marriage, this would represent equality rather than a disparity between the man and woman.  Moreover, it would undermine Emens' claim that there is ""'no realistic possibility'"" of both people changing.  Consequently, this practice would not exemplify Emens' claims regarding marital naming disparities."
"376","Which of the following is NOT suggested to be a potential social cost of marital naming choices?","C","67","Until the 1970s, many states mandated that women assume their husbands' surnames upon marriage.  Today, women are no longer bound by this constraint, and some, like journalist Ellen Goodman, have argued that future generations will view the tradition of married women changing their names as a kind of madness. (Paragraph 1)
Law professor Elizabeth Emens notes that although…a married woman may legally decline to become ""Mrs. His Name"" (a term used by psychologist Jean M. Twenge), it is still customary for children's surnames to be conferred patrilinearly.  Hence, a prospective bride faces a dilemma of symbolic identity; she may either retain her nominal connection to her parents and past self or create a nominal connection to her husband and future children. (Paragraph 2)
The passage conveys that ""[u]ntil the 1970s, many states mandated that women assume their husbands' surnames upon marriage"" (Paragraph 1), but now ""a married woman may legally decline to become 'Mrs. His Name'"" (Paragraph 2).  As a result, today's ""prospective bride faces a dilemma of symbolic identity"" regarding whether to adopt her husband's surname or retain her maiden name (Paragraph 2).  Although one might imagine this issue causing disagreement, the passage never suggests that conflict between prospective brides and grooms is a potential social cost of marital naming choices.
  By contrast, the passage suggests that all of the following are potential social costs of marital naming choices:
Losing generational continuity of surnames (Choice A).  Paragraph 2 implies that a woman who keeps her maiden name to ""retain her nominal connection to her parents and past self"" is disadvantaged compared to her husband, who ""'has the same name as his parents and his child and thus continuity across all three generations of his family.'""
Legal impediments to some name changes (Choice B).  Paragraph 5 mentions ""the legal inequities surrounding traditional marital naming"" and indicates that ""men…face arduous (difficult) legal and social challenges to changing their own names.""
Being judged continuously by other people (Choice D).  Paragraph 2 suggests that a woman who chooses to hyphenate her surname ""'bears the hassle of all the…people who think she's constantly trying to make a point about her independence.'""  Similarly, Paragraph 3 describes ""disadvantages [that] are associated with societally atypical naming choices…such as a woman whose new neighbors would not believe she and her husband were truly married."""
"377","Which of the following statements is most contrary to information presented in the passage?","B","67","Law professor Elizabeth Emens notes that although cases such as Kruzel v Podell and Dunn v Palermo established in 1975 that a married woman may legally decline to become ""Mrs. His Name"" (a term used by psychologist Jean M. Twenge), it is still customary for children's surnames to be conferred patrilinearly. (Paragraph 2)
In a 1996 Good Housekeeping article, Peggy Noonan advocates for the value of name changing as reflecting the couple's commitment to marriage….  ""[F]or these brides, taking their husbands' names is a declaration not only of intention, but of faith…faith in yourself and your spouse.""  Noonan ends her article by applauding the trend of more couples choosing to share a married surname. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 2 cites court cases that ""established in 1975 that a married woman may legally decline to become 'Mrs. His Name.'""  This information would suggest that after 1975, it became more common for married women to keep their maiden names.  However, Paragraph 4 describes ""a 1996 Good Housekeeping article"" that mentions ""brides…taking their husbands' names"" as part of a ""trend of more couples choosing to share a married surname.""
If there were a trend in 1996 in which more brides took their husbands' names, that means that the number of women who kept their maiden names was decreasing at that time.  Accordingly, the passage indicates that sometime prior to 1996, the number of women keeping their maiden names began to diminish.  Therefore, the statement that the number of married women retaining their maiden names steadily increased in the 1980s and 1990s is contrary to information presented in the passage.
  By contrast, none of the following statements is contrary to information presented in the passage:
After considering the social implications, Peggy Noonan legally adopted her husband's last name upon marriage (Choice A).  This decision would be consistent with the ""1996 Good Housekeeping article"" in which ""Peggy Noonan advocates for the value of name changing as reflecting the couple's commitment to marriage"" (Paragraph 4).
Today, it is often easier for women to change their names upon marriage than it is for men to do so (Choice C).  The passage indicates that women may ""assume their husbands' surnames upon marriage"" (Paragraph 1) or ""legally decline"" to do so (Paragraph 2).  By contrast, Paragraph 5 indicates that ""men…face arduous (difficult) legal and social challenges to changing their own names.""  Therefore, the passage implies that men face obstacles to changing their names that women do not encounter.
The right of a married woman to either keep or change her surname has been upheld by federal courts (Choice D).  Paragraph 2 mentions that ""cases such as Kruzel v Podell and Dunn v Palermo established in 1975 that a married woman may legally decline to become 'Mrs. His Name.'""  Although the passage does not mention whether these were federal or state cases, it would be consistent with passage information if those legal decisions had been upheld by federal courts."
"378","Some social theorists argue that because there are problems with any approach to marital naming, maintaining the traditional practice is the most beneficial course of action.  Does passage information support this claim?","D","67","Law professor Elizabeth Emens notes that although…a married woman may legally decline to become ""Mrs. His Name"" (a term used by psychologist Jean M. Twenge), it is still customary for children's surnames to be conferred patrilinearly.  Hence…she may either retain her nominal connection to her parents and past self or create a nominal connection to her husband and future children.  Meanwhile, Emens continues, ""her husband has the same name as his parents and his child and thus continuity across all three generations of his family."" (Paragraph 2)
Emens criticizes this stance.  As she argues, equating commitment to marriage with a woman's willingness to change her name makes sense ""only when there is no realistic possibility of him or both changing"" to create a shared surname. (Paragraph 5)
Elizabeth Emens notes that because ""it is still customary for children's surnames to be conferred patrilinearly (ie, according to the father's surname),"" a woman must choose between sharing a name with her parents or sharing a name with her husband and children (Paragraph 2).  By contrast, her husband does not face this dilemma as he ""'has the same name as his parents and his child and thus continuity across all three generations of his family'"" (Paragraph 2).  Emens similarly describes the inordinate pressure a woman faces to change her name since ""'there is no realistic possibility of him [her husband] or both changing' to create a shared surname"" (Paragraph 5).
By describing these and other social costs that women face, the passage implies that women are unfairly disadvantaged by marital naming tradition.  Although the passage mentions that there are ""some who see the issue differently"" (Paragraph 4), that discussion is followed by a description of how ""Emens criticizes this stance"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, passage information would not support the view that, because there are problems with any approach to marital naming, maintaining the traditional practice is the most beneficial course of action.  Rather, the majority of the passage emphasizes the views of people like Emens, who illustrates the unjust burdens that the traditional practice places upon women.
  (Choice A)  Yes; there are significant social costs borne by women who make societally atypical naming choices.  Paragraph 3 states that ""disadvantages are associated with societally atypical naming choices"" and cites examples such as ""eliciting confusion when introducing oneself"" and ""a woman whose new neighbors would not believe she and her husband were truly married.""  However, the passage never presents these disadvantages as reasons to maintain traditional naming practices.
(Choice B)  No; future generations will consider it ridiculous that women used to change their names upon marrying.  Paragraph 1 states that ""some, like journalist Ellen Goodman, have argued that future generations will view the tradition of married women changing their names as a kind of madness.""  However, Paragraph 4 implies that ""brides…taking their husbands' names"" has regained popularity as part of a ""trend of more couples choosing to share a married surname.""  This trend would suggest that public opinion toward a married woman changing her name to that of her husband has grown more favorable.  Therefore, passage information does not necessarily support the idea that future generations will consider it ridiculous that women used to change their names upon marrying.
(Choice C)  Yes; Noonan argues that the departure from traditional naming practice has led to a higher incidence of divorce.  Peggy Noonan writes in 1996 that ""the typical 'bride in her 20s grew up in the Age of Divorce,'"" and suggests that this fact has motivated ""the trend of more couples choosing to share a married surname"" (Paragraph 4).  However, although Noonan presents this trend as a reaction by children of divorced parents, she does not claim that a departure from traditional naming practice caused a higher incidence of divorce."
"379","Regarding the unequal burden on women with respect to marital names, Kelly Snyder argues that the best way to grant women a genuine choice about whether to change names is to make it easier for men to change their own names.  This argument is:","A","67","Like Emens, Snyder stresses the importance of name to a person's sense of self as well as the legal inequities surrounding traditional marital naming.  In her view, the best way to promote a woman's freedom to make a genuine choice about her name is to facilitate men's ability to change names when marrying.  If men no longer face arduous legal and social challenges to changing their own names, then the idea of a woman doing so will no longer be seen as the natural default position. (Paragraph 5)
Kelly Snyder argues that men ""face arduous (difficult) legal and social challenges to changing their own names,"" which contributes to a perception that it is ""the natural default position"" for a woman to change her name (Paragraph 5).  Sharing a married surname requires at least one person to change surnames.  Accordingly, it is clear that if one person will not change names upon marrying, then the other person must.  Therefore, Snyder's argument is plausible because the expectation that women will change their names depends on the expectation that men will keep theirs.
  (Choice B)  implausible, because the argument is supposedly meant to benefit women, but it focuses on reducing a burden for men.  Snyder argues that ""the best way to promote a woman's freedom to make a genuine choice about her name is to facilitate men's ability to change names when marrying"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, she proposes to decrease the ""arduous legal and social challenges to changing [men's] own names"" (Paragraph 5).  Although this change would reduce a burden on men, it would also benefit women because it would ""no longer be seen as the natural default position"" for women to change their names.  Therefore, it is plausible (not implausible) to think that her suggestion would benefit women as well as men.
(Choice C)  plausible, because Snyder points out that name changing by either men or women would be a symbol of commitment to marriage.  By questioning why commitment to marriage ""'should explain a woman's choice to change her name, but not a man's'"" (Paragraph 5), Snyder implies that name changing by either a man or a woman would symbolize commitment to marriage.  However, this point is a separate issue from the question of whether ""the best way to promote a woman's freedom to make a genuine choice about her name is to facilitate men's ability to change names when marrying"" (Paragraph 5).
(Choice D)  implausible, because Snyder stresses how important a name is to a person's sense of self.  Paragraph 5 states that ""Snyder stresses the importance of name to a person's sense of self.""  Although this view may motivate Snyder's desire to ""promote a woman's freedom to make a genuine choice about her name,"" it does not affect the plausibility of her claim that the best way to achieve this goal ""is to facilitate men's ability to change names when marrying."""
"380","Jack White, the lead singer of the band The White Stripes, took the surname of his wife, Meg White, when they married in 1996.  This information would LEAST support which of the following passage claims?","C","67","Hence, a prospective bride faces a dilemma of symbolic identity; she may either retain her nominal connection to her parents and past self or create a nominal connection to her husband and future children.  Meanwhile, Emens continues, ""her husband has the same name as his parents and his child and thus continuity across all three generations of his family.""  Alternatively, a woman might attempt to bridge both worlds through hyphenation, by which ""she alone bears the hassle…."" (Paragraph 2)
Other disadvantages are associated with societally atypical naming choices….  Men also experience social backlash if they choose to adopt or incorporate their wives' names, such as movie reviewer Sam Van Hallgren, who acquired the ""Van"" from Carrie Van Deest.  Those cases are rare, however; thus, it is women who primarily endure these kinds of burdens. (Paragraph 3)
The passage states that a marrying woman faces a ""dilemma of symbolic identity,"" whereas a man ""'has the same name as his parents and his child and thus continuity across all three generations of his family'"" (Paragraph 2).  Alternatively, a woman might take a hyphenated name, for which ""'she alone bears the hassle'"" (Paragraph 2) associated with changing to a nontraditional formulation.  The passage further conveys that although ""[m]en also experience social backlash if they choose to adopt or incorporate their wives' names…[t]hose cases are rare… thus, it is women who primarily endure these kinds of burdens"" (Paragraph 3).
However, Jack White is a man who assumed his wife's surname, in contrast to what the passage says is typical.  Accordingly, it is he (rather than his wife) who would have faced any difficulties arising from this ""societally atypical"" naming choice (Paragraph 3).  Consequently, this information would least support the passage claim that the burdens associated with marital naming are suffered primarily by women, as Jack White's case would instead represent the opposite situation of a man suffering those burdens.
  By contrast, the fact that Jack White assumed his wife's surname is more consistent with each of the following passage claims:
A commitment to marriage is a good reason for both men and women to change their names (Choice A).  A man (such as Jack White) who changes his name upon marriage exemplifies the idea that both men and women can show commitment to marriage by adopting a new surname.
In most cases, children are given their father's surname (Choice B).  Jack White taking his wife's surname constitutes an exception to the societal convention of men keeping their surnames at marriage.  However, it does not constitute an exception to the societal convention of children being given their father's surname.  (Moreover, the passage never mentions whether Jack and Meg White had any children.)
There are many inequities surrounding marital naming (Choice D).  Although Jack White's decision to take his wife's name could be viewed as promoting greater equality between men and women, that decision nonetheless represents an unequal situation surrounding marital naming.  In this case, sharing a married surname still resulted in one person (the husband) losing the ""nominal connection to [his] parents and past self"" (Paragraph 2)."
"381","Which of the following individuals would the passage author most likely regard as a true practitioner of wabi-sabi as this term is explained in Paragraph 5?","C","68","Unlike the standard concept of beauty in the West that favors symmetry, proportion, and static perfection, wabi-sabi embraces the imperfect and celebrates the transient.  It exalts the rustic and the humble as exemplified by the pottery used in the tea ceremony, which is typically crude, ordinary looking, and even asymmetrical.  Moreover…a chip or crack, and even the general wear and tear of repeated use, renders such objects more interesting and, hence, more aesthetically pleasing....  The simplicity, humility, and naturalism epitomized by wabi-sabi thus became the hallmarks of the way of tea. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, the term wabi-sabi ""exalts the rustic and the humble as exemplified by the pottery used in the tea ceremony, which is typically crude, ordinary looking, and even asymmetrical.""  Furthermore, Paragraph 5 lists ""simplicity"" as one of the ""hallmarks of the way of tea"" that are ""epitomized by wabi-sabi.""  Accordingly, someone who values the simplicity of the vessels used in the tea ceremony would be clearly aligning himself or herself with a hallmark of wabi-sabi.  Therefore, he or she would likely be regarded as a true practitioner of wabi-sabi as this term is explained in Paragraph 5.
(Choices A and D)  Paragraph 5 states that vessels that exemplify wabi-sabi would be ""typically crude,"" ""asymmetrical,"" and ""ordinary looking"" and might even have ""a chip or crack.""  Pottery vessels that are handcrafted or cups that are antique could be crudely constructed and cracked or chipped; however, they could just as likely be perfectly constructed and elaborately decorated.  Therefore, someone who serves tea in either handcrafted pottery vessels or antique cups would not necessarily be regarded as a true practitioner of wabi-sabi as the term is explained in Paragraph 5.

Indeed, the tea ceremony was in its origins closely entwined with the political elite of the country; by the fifteenth century, however, it had begun to spread to all classes.  Murata Shuko, known as ""the father of the tea ceremony,"" had been largely responsible for moving the tea ceremony away from the political to become more ""transformative"" or spiritual in nature.

Toward the end of the twelfth century, another Japanese monk, Myoan Eisai, traveled to China to study philosophy and religion, returning with the seeds of green tea plants.  Eisai went on to build the first Zen Buddhist temple in his native land and was the first of his nation to cultivate tea purely for religious purposes. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 states that ""Eichu brought green tea to Japan from China, where it had already been cultivated for more than 1,000 years and used by monks to facilitate meditation.""  Paragraph 2 also says that ""[t]oward the end of the twelfth century, another Japanese monk, Myoan Eisai, traveled to China to study philosophy and religion, returning with the seeds of green tea plants.  Eisai went on to build the first Zen Buddhist temple in his native land and was the first of his nation to cultivate tea purely for religious purposes.""  Therefore, both Eichu and Eisai had an essential impact on the culture of tea in Japan.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 2 makes it clear that Eichu ""brought green tea from China"" to Japan and that Eisai returned from China ""with the seeds of green tea plants.""  Furthermore, Paragraph 2 emphasizes that Eisai ""traveled to China to study philosophy and religion.""  On his return, he built ""the first Zen Buddhist temple in his native land and was the first of his nation to cultivate tea purely for religious purposes.""  However, the passage never suggests that Eichu and Eisai brought back other distinctly Chinese ways of life or that they began a cultural trend of imitating the Chinese lifestyle in Japan.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 2 relates that ""[e]arlier in the century, the Chinese master Lu Yu had composed a treatise on the cultivation and preparation of tea called Cha Jing, or The Classic of Tea.""  Paragraph 2 also states that ""[t]his treatise was heavily influenced by Buddhist ideas, which then impacted the development of the Japanese tea ceremony.""  However, the passage never suggests that Eichu and Eisai introduced Chinese treatises on tea that eventually became influential.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 2 says that Eichu was ""a Buddhist monk"" who brought green tea back to Japan after a trip to China where it was ""used by monks to facilitate meditation.""  Moreover, Paragraph 2 stresses that when Eisai returned to Japan from China, he ""went on to build the first Zen Buddhist temple in his native land and was the first of his nation to cultivate tea purely for religious purposes.""  Therefore, based on the passage, Eichu and Eisai did not impede (hinder) but, more likely, encouraged the spread of Zen Buddhism in Japan."
"384","Given the information in the passage, the aesthetic of the tea ceremony promoted by both Shuko and Rikyu is one that:","C","68","Chiefly through the efforts of Shuko and Rikyu, the tea ceremony took on a distinctive artistic character and became known as wabi-cha.  The term ""wabi,"" or often ""wabi-sabi,"" refers to the quintessential Japanese aesthetic founded upon the three Buddhist marks of existence: impermanence, suffering, and emptiness.  Unlike the standard concept of beauty in the West that favors symmetry, proportion, and static perfection, wabi-sabi embraces the imperfect and celebrates the transient.  It exalts the rustic and the humble as exemplified by the pottery used in the tea ceremony, which is typically crude, ordinary looking, and even asymmetrical.  Moreover, it is thought that a chip or crack, and even the general wear and tear of repeated use, renders such objects more interesting and, hence, more aesthetically pleasing.  Outdoors, such beauty is found in the fleeting color of autumn leaves and the patina that forms on roof tiles after exposure to the elements.  The simplicity, humility, and naturalism epitomized by wabi-sabi thus became the hallmarks of the way of tea. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, ""[c]hiefly through the efforts of Shuko and Rikyu, the tea ceremony took on a distinctive artistic character and became known as wabi-cha.  The term 'wabi,' or often 'wabi-sabi,' refers to the quintessential (most representative) Japanese aesthetic…[which] embraces the imperfect and celebrates the transient (what is subject to change).""  In this aesthetic, Paragraph 5 claims, ""it is thought that a chip or crack, and even the general wear and tear of repeated use (ie, a type of change over time), renders such objects more interesting and, hence, more aesthetically pleasing.  Outdoors, such beauty is found in the fleeting color of autumn leaves and the patina that forms on roof tiles after exposure to the elements.""
These examples of wabi-sabi demonstrate how things, particularly in nature, are transient and subject to change.  Consequently, based on the information in the passage, the notion that everything in nature is subject to change is consistent with the aesthetic of the tea ceremony as promoted by Shuko and Rikyu.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 5 states that ""[c]hiefly through the efforts Shuko and Rikyu, the tea ceremony took on [the] distinctive artistic character"" of ""wabi-sabi"" which ""refers to the quintessential Japanese aesthetic"" that ""embraces the imperfect and celebrates the transient.""  Wabi-sabi also ""exalts the rustic and the humble as exemplified by the pottery used in the tea ceremony.""  Accordingly, based on passage evidence, the aesthetic of the tea ceremony, or wabi-sabi, as promoted by both Shuko and Rikyu, is one that exemplifies, rather than departs from, the traditional aesthetic principles of Japanese culture.
(Choices B and D)  Paragraph 5 states that ""the quintessential Japanese aesthetic,"" or wabi-sabi, which is the aesthetic of the Japanese tea ceremony, is ""[u]nlike the standard concept of beauty in the West"" and ""embraces the imperfect and celebrates the transient.""  However, the passage never suggests that this aesthetic has inspired Westerners to reflect on their standards of beauty nor that many Westerners learn to appreciate this aesthetic once they have been exposed to it."
"385","According to the passage, it can be assumed that a goal of teaism is to:","B","68","The tea ceremony is practiced to promote the harmony of nature and humanity as well as to discipline the mind and calm the heart of those who seek enlightenment. (Paragraph 1)
Rikyu's teachings fostered the development of the way of tea based on four cardinal principles—harmony, respect, purity, and tranquility—which were meant to be incorporated into the daily life of the tea practitioner. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 1 declares that ""the tea ceremony is practiced to promote the harmony of nature and humanity as well as to discipline the mind and calm the heart of those who seek enlightenment.""  According to Paragraph 4, ""Rikyu's teachings fostered the development of the way of tea based on four cardinal principles—harmony, respect, purity, and tranquility—which were meant to be incorporated into the daily life of the tea practitioner.""
Therefore, it can be assumed that a goal of teaism is to develop composure (tranquility) and equilibrium (harmony or balance) in the everyday life of the tea practitioner.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 4 states that the tea master Sen no Rikyu ""codified"" the performance of the Japanese tea ceremony, which ""meant that every action and gesture on the part of the preparer…constituted a procedure to be performed in a prescribed manner.  Even the actions of the guests evolved to become scripted in a precise ritual.""  As this strict codification and scripting is the opposite of self-expression, it cannot be assumed that a goal of teaism is to facilitate individual expression during the ceremony.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 2 says that the monk Eichu ""brought green tea to Japan from China"" in the ninth century, and that ""[t]oward the end of the twelfth century, another Japanese monk, Myoan Eisai, traveled to China to study philosophy and religion, returning with the seeds of green tea plants.""  Eichu and Eisai may therefore have educated the Japanese about the benefits of the green tea they brought back from China.  However, the passage never identifies educating Japanese tea practitioners about the benefits of green tea from China as a goal of teaism, which is concerned ""to incorporate the four cardinal principles,"" including harmony and tranquility, ""into the daily life of the tea practitioner"" (Paragraph 4).
(Choice D)  Paragraph 3 asserts that Shuko ""had been largely responsible for moving the tea ceremony away from the political to become more 'transformative' or spiritual in nature.""  However, this move toward a spiritual purpose does not suggest that the tea ceremony would provide opportunities for practitioners to showcase (put on display) their enlightenment.  Furthermore, Paragraph 5 lists ""humility"" among ""the hallmarks of the way of tea,"" and showcasing enlightenment would exemplify pride more than humility."
"386","Based on the passage, which of the following descriptions would best represent the character of the tea ceremony imparted by Murata Shuko in fifteenth-century Japan?","A","68","Indeed, the tea ceremony was in its origins closely entwined with the political elite of the country; by the fifteenth century, however, it had begun to spread to all classes.  Murata Shuko, known as ""the father of the tea ceremony,"" had been largely responsible for moving the tea ceremony away from the political to become more ""transformative"" or spiritual in nature.  For instance, he greatly enhanced the simplicity of its presentation, making tea ceremonies less formal and more intimate.  Gatherings now took place in smaller tearooms or secluded teahouses rather than luxurious salons. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 states that by the fifteenth century, ""Murata Shuko, known as 'the father of the tea ceremony,' had been largely responsible for moving the tea ceremony away from the political to become more 'transformative' or spiritual in nature.""  Consequently, a sacred (spiritual) practice would best represent the character of the tea ceremony imparted by Murata Shuko in fifteenth-century Japan.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 4 states that ""the famous tea master Sen no Rikyu…elevated the tea ceremony to a virtual art form and codified its performance.  This meant that every action and gesture on the part of the preparer…constituted a procedure to be performed in a prescribed manner.  Even the actions of the guests evolved to become scripted in a precise ritual.""  This evidence shows that it was Rikyu (not Shuko) who made the tea ceremony into a highly ritualized performance.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 3 asserts that ""tea culture, or 'teaism,' in Japan was initially popular with the ruling class, and the samurai adopted it as a status symbol.""  However, although teaism was ""in its origins closely entwined with the political elite…by the fifteenth century…it had begun to spread to all classes.  Murata Shuko…had been largely responsible for moving the tea ceremony away from the political to become more 'transformative' or spiritual in nature….  [H]e greatly enhanced the simplicity of its presentation, making tea ceremonies less formal and more intimate.""  As a result, Shuko removed the ceremony from association with any political and aristocratic (class) status (ie, it was no longer an aristocratic affair).
(Choice D)  Paragraph 5 notes that ""[c]hiefly through the efforts of [both] Shuko and Rikyu, the tea ceremony took on a distinctive artistic character and became known as wabi-cha.""  However, although Shuko moved the tea ceremony ""to become more 'transformative' or spiritual in nature"" (Paragraph 3), it was ""the famous tea master Sen no Rikyu who later elevated the tea ceremony to a virtual art form"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, it was only Rikyu (not Shuko) who turned the ceremony into a kind of artistic display."
"387","For which of the following assertions does the author provide the most support?","D","69","There may be reasons to reject the idea of lengthening the school day.  None of them, however, are good reasons.  Rather, the supposed demerits of such a proposal fall easily in the face of its numerous financial and social benefits for families. (Paragraph 1)
Can we truly ask schoolteachers…to endure even more hours in the classroom?  The answer is that a lengthened school day need not distress teachers nor add to their already cumbersome workload….  [T]he extension would give schools cause to hire new, perhaps specialized, faculty to offer these courses. (Paragraph 4)
Whether through paying current teachers more or hiring new ones, implementing such a proposal would entail a significant financial expenditure.  There are at least two responses to this line of thinking.  First is that this increase in the cost of schooling would be offset and likely surpassed by the aforementioned savings in childcare….  Second is that schools should be better funded regardless….  Lengthening the school day is simply one manifestation of how such funding should be utilized. (Paragraph 5)
While arguing for a longer school day, the author acknowledges that there are objections to that idea.  However, they claim that those objections are easy to address, stating that ""the supposed demerits"" of the proposal ""fall easily in the face of its numerous financial and social benefits for families"" (Paragraph 1).  The passage later provides specific examples of objections and the author's responses to them.
For instance, Paragraph 4 discusses the concern that longer school days might be detrimental to teachers.  According to the author, ""[A] lengthened school day need not distress teachers nor add to their already cumbersome workload"" because it ""would give schools cause to hire new, perhaps specialized, faculty"" rather than require current teachers to spend more time in the classroom.
Similarly, Paragraph 5 conveys that although lengthening the school day ""would entail a significant financial expenditure,"" that cost ""would be offset and likely surpassed by the aforementioned savings in childcare.""  Thus, without increasing the financial burden on families, lengthening the school day could ""coordinate the lives of parents and children, reduce the need for costly childcare, and expand curricular offerings"" (Paragraph 6).
Therefore, the author offers counterarguments to various objections to their proposal, providing support for the assertion that reasons to maintain the current school day's duration are easily refuted.
  By contrast, the author does not provide support for the following assertions:
Schools pay too much attention to standardized tests (Choice A).  Paragraph 3 conveys that many schools have ""cut instruction in arts, music, and physical education (as well as recess) in order to meet objectives in reading and math.""  The author then goes on to claim that ""this unfortunate state of affairs can be partially blamed on overzealous attention to standardized tests.""  However, they do not support this claim with any data or examples of schools focusing on standardized tests.
It is beyond dispute that schools should receive more funding (Choice B).  In Paragraph 5, the author states: ""It is beyond dispute that schools across the board both need and deserve a radically increased investment from citizens.  Lengthening the school day is simply one manifestation of how such funding should be utilized.""  However, although the author does argue for the claim that the school day should be lengthened, they never provide an argument that it is beyond dispute that schools need and deserve additional funding.  Rather, the author seems to take for granted that no one would dispute this claim.
Schoolteachers are some of the most overworked individuals in society (Choice C).  Paragraph 4 states that schoolteachers are ""among the most overworked individuals in society"" and describes them as having a ""cumbersome workload.""  However, the author does not provide any evidence to support this claim but simply treats it as a position with which everyone would agree."
"388","Based on the information presented in the passage, one could most reasonably conclude that a significant portion of the funding a school receives is based on the:","C","69","First is that this increase in the cost of schooling would be offset and likely surpassed by the aforementioned savings in childcare.  Thus, while it is true that schools would require greater funding (likely necessitating higher property taxes), parents would ultimately pay the same or less overall, with greater educational opportunities for their children and fewer transportational burdens. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, providing greater funding for schools would ""likely necessitat[e] higher property taxes.""  Thus, the passage implies that a school's funding depends on the taxable value of nearby property.  Therefore, based on the information presented in the passage, one could most reasonably conclude that a significant portion of the funding a school receives is based on the value of homes and other buildings.
  By contrast, the passage does not suggest that the funding a school receives is based on the:
amount of time spent in the classroom (Choice A).  In Paragraph 5, the author points out that ""some schools…have even reduced school weeks to only four days as a cost-saving measure.""  Accordingly, such schools have had to decrease the amount of time spent in the classroom because of the costs involved.  Therefore, the passage indicates that the amount of time which can be spent in the classroom is constrained by a school's funding, not that the funding a school receives is based on the amount of time spent in the classroom.
local need for childcare (Choice B).  A major theme of the passage is that funding a lengthened school day would provide ""numerous financial and social benefits for families"" (Paragraph 1), especially ""reducing the need for childcare"" (Paragraph 2).  Therefore, the passage implies that the need for childcare ought to influence the funding a school receives, because enabling the school day to be lengthened would help address that need.  In other words, the passage argues that a school's funding is not currently affected by the local need for childcare, but it should be.
breadth of its curriculum (Choice D).  Paragraph 3 suggests that many schools possess insufficient resources to maintain a broad curriculum, as they ""have increasingly cut instruction in arts, music, and physical education (as well as recess) in order to meet objectives in reading and math.""  Accordingly, the passage does not suggest that breadth of curriculum contributes to a school's funding.  Rather, the author suggests that funding a longer school day could help make a broader curriculum possible, reversing the ""deleterious trend of narrowing students' instruction"" and thereby ""enriching students with a more well-rounded education."""
"389","Suppose a politician remarked that lengthening the school day would essentially make schools childcare facilities.  What effect would this statement have on claims made in the passage?","A","69","The greatest of these benefits lies in reducing the need for childcare.  It is a curious fact of American life that the adult's work schedule and the child's school schedule are misaligned….  In a society where, more often than not, both parents work, this discordance creates the need for an expensive arrangement to fill the gap in families' routines….  Transportation to and from care sites only adds to that expense. (Paragraph 2)
With this one change, states can coordinate the lives of parents and children, reduce the need for costly childcare, and expand curricular offerings.  These worthy and desirable aims provide a clear justification for extending the school day. (Paragraph 6)
In Paragraph 2, the author argues that an important advantage of lengthening the school day ""lies in reducing the need for childcare.""  The fact that ""the adult's work schedule and the child's school schedule are misaligned…creates the need for an expensive arrangement to fill the gap in families' routines.""  Moreover, ""[t]ransportation to and from care sites only adds to that expense.""  Thus, increasing the length of time that students remain at school would benefit families by making after-school childcare unnecessary.
Similarly, in Paragraph 6 the author asserts that ""states can coordinate the lives of parents and children, reduce the need for costly childcare, and expand curricular offerings,"" concluding that ""[t]hese worthy and desirable aims provide a clear justification for extending the school day.""
Hence, if a politician remarked that lengthening the school day would essentially make schools childcare facilities, that would align with the author's goal of reducing the financial and transportational burdens of childcare.  The author specifically calls for keeping children at school instead of sending them to a separate childcare site, replacing what used to be after-school childcare with an additional part of the school day.  Therefore, the politician's statement would support the author's claim that a longer school day would benefit parents.
  (Choice B)  It would reinforce the arguments for keeping the school day as it is.  The contention that the author's proposal would make schools childcare facilities does not oppose any of the author's claims about lengthening the school day.  Rather, it implies the author is correct that a longer school day would benefit families by ""reducing the need for costly childcare"" (Paragraph 2) and leaving them with ""fewer transportational burdens"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, the politician's statement would not reinforce the arguments for keeping the school day as it is.
(Choice C)  It would challenge the author's claim that transportation to childcare sites burdens parents.  Paragraph 2 states that ""[t]ransportation to and from care sites only adds to that expense [of childcare],"" implying that parents are burdened by the need for children to go to a separate location after school.  Therefore, the politician's statement would not challenge the author's assertion about such transportational burdens.  Instead, it suggests that the author's proposal would help address that issue, because children would be able to remain at school instead of going to another site for childcare.
(Choice D)  It would have no effect on the claims made in the passage.  Although the politician's statement would not challenge any of the claims made in the passage, it would support the claim that ""states can coordinate the lives of parents and children"" and ""reduce the need for costly childcare"" (Paragraph 6)."
"390","The passage author would most likely support a plan for schools to:","D","69","An additional advantage of an extended school day would be to allow for greater diversity and depth in curricula.  Schools across the country have increasingly cut instruction in arts, music, and physical education (as well as recess) in order to meet objectives in reading and math.  While this unfortunate state of affairs can be partially blamed on overzealous attention to standardized tests, it points to the larger deleterious trend of narrowing students' instruction.  With a longer school day, such eliminated subjects can be restored, enriching students with a more well-rounded education. (Paragraph 3)
By providing for additional areas of study in the arts and humanities, the extension would give schools cause to hire new, perhaps specialized, faculty to offer these courses. (Paragraph 4)
With this one change, states can coordinate the lives of parents and children, reduce the need for costly childcare, and expand curricular offerings.  These worthy and desirable aims provide a clear justification for extending the school day. (Paragraph 6)
At multiple points in the passage, the author advocates including more arts and humanities courses in school curricula.  For example, in Paragraph 3 they lament the fact that schools ""have increasingly cut instruction in arts, music, and physical education (as well as recess) in order to meet objectives in reading and math.""  The author criticizes this situation as a ""deleterious trend of narrowing students' instruction"" and argues that ""[w]ith a longer school day, such eliminated subjects can be restored, enriching students with a more well-rounded education.""
Similarly, Paragraph 4 describes ""providing for additional areas of study in the arts and humanities"" as a benefit of lengthening the school day, and Paragraph 6 reiterates that a longer school day would allow schools to ""expand curricular offerings.""  Therefore, the passage author would most likely support a plan for schools to require students to take at least one art or music course per semester, ensuring that such courses are part of the curriculum.
  (Choice A)  enhance classroom instruction through greater focus on STEM disciplines.  The author argues for ""enriching students with a more well-rounded education"" (Paragraph 3) and connects this broader education with ""providing for additional areas of study in the arts and humanities"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, the author would not necessarily support a greater focus on STEM disciplines (ie, courses outside the arts and humanities).
(Choice B)  spend more classroom time studying particular subjects on certain days.  The author advocates ""lengthening the school day"" (Paragraph 1) because it ""allow[s] for greater diversity and depth in curricula"" (Paragraph 3).  However, spending more classroom time studying particular subjects on certain days would not necessarily mean that the school day was longer overall.  Similarly, focusing more time on particular subjects on certain days would not necessarily mean that diverse subjects are being covered.
(Choice C)  replace courses in reading and math with courses in the humanities.  Paragraph 3 notes the ""unfortunate state of affairs"" that schools ""have increasingly cut instruction in arts, music, and physical education (as well as recess) in order to meet objectives in reading and math.""  However, the author never recommends replacing courses in reading and math with courses in the humanities.  Rather, thry state that ""[w]ith a longer school day, such eliminated subjects can be restored,"" implying that there would be time for all these courses."
"391","Which of the following statements, if true, would most weaken the passage argument for lengthening the school day?","B","69","There may be reasons to reject the idea of lengthening the school day.  None of them, however, are good reasons.  Rather, the supposed demerits of such a proposal fall easily in the face of its numerous financial and social benefits for families. (Paragraph 1)
To this proposal, however, critics may object that the added time would impose strain on educators.  Can we truly ask schoolteachers—already among the most overworked individuals in society—to endure even more hours in the classroom?  The answer is that a lengthened school day need not distress teachers nor add to their already cumbersome workload.  By providing for additional areas of study in the arts and humanities, the extension would give schools cause to hire new, perhaps specialized, faculty to offer these courses. (Paragraph 4)
One of the author's claims in arguing for a lengthened school day is that the supposed problems with that proposal can be easily dismissed.  According to Paragraph 1, ""There may be reasons to reject the idea of lengthening the school day.  None of them, however, are good reasons.""  Thus, the author argues that objections to a longer school day ""fall easily in the face of its numerous financial and social benefits for families.""
For example, Paragraph 4 mentions the objection that ""the added time would impose strain on educators.""  The author rejects this worry, arguing that ""a lengthened school day need not distress teachers nor add to their already cumbersome workload"" because ""the extension would give schools cause to hire new, perhaps specialized, faculty.""  Accordingly, the author argues that lengthening the school day would benefit families without negatively impacting teachers' job satisfaction.
However, if lengthening the school day did distress teachers or add to their workload (despite the author's claims to the contrary), that drawback would constitute an objection that did not in fact ""fall easily"" (Paragraph 1).  Therefore, the passage argument would be most weakened if a longer school day leads to a decreased sense of job satisfaction among teachers.
  By contrast, none of the following statements would weaken the passage argument for lengthening the school day:
A longer school day's cost in taxes is nearly as much as what parents currently pay for childcare (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 5, ""while it is true that schools would require greater funding (likely necessitating higher property taxes), parents would ultimately pay the same or less overall.""  Hence, if a longer school day's cost in taxes were nearly as much as (ie, only slightly less than) what parents currently pay for childcare, that would be consistent with the author's argument.
A longer school day increases the amount schools must spend to fund faculty positions (Choice C).  The author directly states that ""[w]hether through paying current teachers more or hiring new ones, implementing such a proposal would entail a significant financial expenditure"" (Paragraph 5).  Accordingly, the passage argument includes the claim that lengthening the school day would increase the cost of funding faculty positions.
A longer school day produces no improvement in student test scores (Choice D).  The author alludes to the concern for academic performance represented by an ""overzealous attention to standardized tests"" (Paragraph 3).  However, they never argue that lengthening the school day would improve student test scores."
"392","Which of the following pieces of information would be most important to know in order to assess the strength of the author's argument?","B","69","There may be reasons to reject the idea of lengthening the school day.  None of them, however, are good reasons.  Rather, the supposed demerits of such a proposal fall easily in the face of its numerous financial and social benefits for families. (Paragraph 1)
The greatest of these benefits lies in reducing the need for childcare.  It is a curious fact of American life that the adult's work schedule and the child's school schedule are misaligned.  Children rise with the sun to head to classes, only to be sent home again hours before parents return from their jobs.  In a society where, more often than not, both parents work, this discordance creates the need for an expensive arrangement to fill the gap in families' routines.  For instance, studies show that in 2016, childcare costs accounted for 9.5 to 17.5 percent of median family income, depending on the state.  Today, 40 percent of families nationwide spend over 15 percent of their income on childcare.  Transportation to and from care sites only adds to that expense. (Paragraph 2)
The author argues that lengthening the school day would result in ""numerous financial and social benefits for families"" (Paragraph 1), and Paragraph 2 specifies that ""[t]he greatest of these benefits lies in reducing the need for childcare.""  In particular, the misalignment between the schedules of parents and children ""creates the need for an expensive arrangement to fill the gap in families' routines.""  Therefore, the author implies that the high burdens and costs of childcare are largely due to the needs of parents with school-age children.
However, the need for childcare is not limited to parents with school-age children; in some cases, families require care for younger children who do not yet attend school.  Accordingly, if the money that ""40 percent of families nationwide spend…for childcare"" (Paragraph 2) was mainly devoted to children who are not school-age, then lengthening the school day would not affect those families' childcare arrangements.  In that case, the author's claims about the benefits of lengthening the school day would be undermined.
Therefore, in order to assess the strength of the author's argument, it would be most important to know whether the statistics on childcare refer specifically to school-age children.
  (Choice A)  Whether the statistics on four-day school weeks represent a growing trend.  The fact that ""some schools…have even reduced school weeks to only four days as a cost-saving measure"" is related to the author's general claim that ""schools should be better funded"" (Paragraph 5).  However, whether that practice is a growing trend does not affect the author's argument about the benefits of lengthening the school day, which is meant to ""coordinate the lives of parents and children, reduce the need for costly childcare, and expand curricular offerings"" (Paragraph 6).
(Choice C)  What percentage of class time is currently spent on non-core subjects.  The author argues that lengthening the school day would help to ""coordinate the lives of parents and children, reduce the need for costly childcare, and expand curricular offerings"" (Paragraph 6).  However, even if a significant amount of class time is currently spent on non-core subjects, a longer school day could still enable a school's curriculum to be expanded.  Moreover, the author's other goals (coordinating the lives of parents and children and reducing the need for childcare) would be unaffected by this information.  Accordingly, knowing the percentage of class time that is currently spent on non-core subjects would be less important in assessing the author's argument than knowing whether childcare statistics refer specifically to school-age children.
(Choice D)  What percentage of students currently participate in after-school activities.  Paragraph 4 states that some of the time in a longer school day ""could…be allocated to sports, academic clubs, and other extracurricular activities.""  Accordingly, the percentage of students currently participating in after-school activities could affect some details of the author's argument.  However, Paragraph 2 states that ""40 percent of families nationwide spend over 15 percent of their income on childcare,"" suggesting that whatever number of students actually do participate in after-school activities, childcare remains a significant need for families."
"393","According to the author, the increase in the cost of schooling and associated higher property taxes that would be necessitated by a lengthened school day would be offset by an equal or greater savings in childcare costs.  Which of the following would be the most reasonable objection to this claim?","D","69","Whether through paying current teachers more or hiring new ones, implementing such a proposal would entail a significant financial expenditure.  There are at least two responses to this line of thinking.  First is that this increase in the cost of schooling would be offset and likely surpassed by the aforementioned savings in childcare.  Thus, while it is true that schools would require greater funding (likely necessitating higher property taxes), parents would ultimately pay the same or less overall, with greater educational opportunities for their children and fewer transportational burdens. (Paragraph 5)
In Paragraph 5, the author acknowledges that lengthening the school day would require ""a significant financial expenditure.""  However, they argue that this increased cost ""would be offset and likely surpassed by the aforementioned savings in childcare"" because even though ""schools would require greater funding (likely necessitating higher property taxes), parents would ultimately pay the same or less overall.""
However, property taxes are paid not only by parents of school-age children, but also by other citizens and businesses.  Accordingly, even if it is true that many parents would not pay any more overall, other parties would pay more because they would receive no savings to offset the increased expense of the higher taxes.  Therefore, the most reasonable objection to the author's claim would be that the increased taxes would unfairly impact non-parents and businesses.
  By contrast, all of the following would be less reasonable objections:
The potential drawbacks to lengthening the school day are not all financial in nature (Choice A).  The author's claim about offsetting costs addresses a concern about the ""significant financial expenditure"" (Paragraph 5) that lengthening the school day would require.  However, the author never suggests that this claim addresses any non-financial drawbacks of such a proposal.  Therefore, although such potential drawbacks might be relevant to the author's overall argument, they would not constitute an objection to this specific claim about offsetting costs.
The cost of childcare is too insignificant to offset the added expense (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 2, ""[S]tudies show that in 2016, childcare costs accounted for 9.5 to 17.5 percent of median family income, depending on the state.  Today, 40 percent of families nationwide spend over 15 percent of their income on childcare.""  Given these statistics, it is reasonable to conclude that childcare constitutes a significant expense.  Accordingly, it is plausible that eliminating this expense could largely offset the cost of lengthening the school day.
The school day should ideally be lengthened without raising schools' financial expenditure (Choice C).  Paragraph 5 notes that lengthening the school day would require ""paying current teachers more or hiring new ones.""  Accordingly, the author makes it clear that ""implementing such a proposal would entail a significant financial expenditure"" and could not be accomplished without raising schools' costs."
"394","The author's mention of ""all that had been lost"" suggests that many modernist poets lamented the loss of:","A","70","Hindered by the same internal conflict plaguing many intellectuals within the cultural upheavals of the time, these poets felt, on one level, that old linguistic certainties had evaporated and new forms must be embraced.  Yet many of them, particularly the later modernist poets, maintained a sentimental attachment to all that had been lost from the cultural certitude of earlier eras, their despondency reflected in many of their works. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 states that modernist poets experienced ""the same internal conflict"" within the ""cultural upheavals (major disturbance) of the time"" as many other intellectuals.  The author also claims that many of these poets ""maintained a sentimental attachment to all that had been lost from the cultural certitude (confidence or conviction) of earlier eras.""  This suggests that firmly established or longstanding cultural principles (beliefs) had been removed from society, evoking a sense of loss and lamentation (grief) in these poets.
(Choice B)  According to Paragraph 1, ""the artistic approach"" of the modernist poets was characterized by Pound's phrase ""Make it new!"" which provides strong indication that these poets were intent upon exercising their artistic freedom.  Moreover, these poets felt that not only had ""old linguistic certainties…evaporated,"" but also that ""new forms must be embraced.""  This evidence suggests there had been less artistic freedom in the past and, therefore, these poets could not have lamented the loss of artistic freedom.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 1 states that the modernist poets were plagued by ""internal conflict"" and lamented ""all that had been lost from the cultural certitude of earlier eras.""  However, the passage never suggests that they mourned the loss of any particular practice such as human reflection on self-worth.
(Choice D)  Pound said to poets, ""Make it new!"" (Paragraph 1), and the modernist age was ""defined by its pure and absolute originality.""  Even within this movement, ""Frost and Cummings occupied unique positions"" because their work was so different (Paragraph 6).  Consequently, rather than lamenting any loss of uniformity among their novel works, the modernist poets likely favored individuality."
"395","Which of the following descriptions best represents the type of artist the modernist poets were?","D","70","At the forefront of the modernist poetry movement were T. S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, and others, such as Ezra Pound, whose injunction ""Make it new!"" characterized their artistic approach.  Hindered by the same internal conflict plaguing many intellectuals within the cultural upheavals of the time, these poets felt, on one level, that old linguistic certainties had evaporated and new forms must be embraced.  Yet many of them, particularly the later modernist poets, maintained a sentimental attachment to all that had been lost from the cultural certitude of earlier eras, their despondency reflected in much of their work. (Paragraph 1)
Each shared with other modernist poets an opposition to the scientific rationalism and commercialist vulgarity that had infiltrated Western culture after the Industrial Revolution….Thus, even in an age defined by its pure and absolute originality, Frost and Cummings occupied unique positions within the modernist poetry movement. (Paragraph 6)
According to Paragraph 1, the ""artistic approach"" of the modernist poets was ""characterized"" by Pound's phrase ""Make it new!""  These poets felt that ""old linguistic certainties had evaporated and new forms must be embraced.""  Moreover, Paragraph 6 describes the modernist poets as choosing to reject ""the scientific rationalism and commercialist vulgarity"" that had begun to take hold of society following the Industrial Revolution.  Furthermore, the very era in which the modernist poets lived and wrote is described as ""an age defined by its pure and absolute originality.""
Consequently, the modernist poets are best represented as artists who were independent, bound neither by tradition nor prevailing attitudes.
(Choice A)  The descriptive phrase ""respected artists"" (ie, conservative and well received) would be more applicable to the poets of previous eras who followed convention than to the modernist poets, especially Frost and Cummings, who ""even in an age defined by its pure and absolute originality…occupied unique positions"" (Paragraph 6).
(Choice B)  The passage does not support the idea that the modernist poets could be considered ""artists-in-training,"" meaning artists who are in an early, developmental stage.  Even though many of the modernist poets were experimenting with style and forms, they were already skilled enough to be part of a recognized movement.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 2 states that ""many contemporary critics dismissed [Cummings'] work as self-indulgent.""  However, the passage provides no evidence that the work of all modernist poets was considered ""self-indulgent."""
"396","Which of the following statements is inconsistent with the information in the passage?","D","70","Contrarily, Frost believed that a true poet could—and should—achieve poetic excellence without resorting to what he described as the ""new ways of being new.""  Consequently, his poetry was composed of ordinary sounds that derived from conventional language.  Although many contemporary critics dismissed his work as overly simplistic, or ""too near the level of talk,"" Frost remained unperturbed by such views, holding that poetry sprang from the natural intonations of a person's voice and should remain true to traditional forms. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, Frost's poetry ""was composed of ordinary sounds that derived from conventional (familiar) language.""  Frost held that ""poetry sprang from the natural intonations of a person's voice and should remain true to traditional forms.""  Therefore, Frost's ideal poem would not employ methods that presented familiar language in atypical (nontraditional) forms.
By contrast, the following ideas would be consistent with Frost's ideal poem:
exhibiting the writer's ability to express ideas in colloquial language (Choice A).  As Frost believed ""conventional language"" should be the basis of poetry, colloquialisms (ie, the familiar linguistic forms that people use in everyday speech) would be found in his poetry.  Therefore, Frost's ideal poem would exhibit a poet's ability to express ideas in colloquial language.
guiding the reader and poet into deep contemplation (Choice B).  Frost believed that the practice of poetry provokes ""both poet and reader to recollect an oft-distant truth lingering in some obscure region of the brain"" and ""culminates in wisdom that may be profound or just a momentary reprieve from the world"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, Frost's ideal poem would guide both reader and poet into a state of deep contemplation.
reflective of elements used in Romantic poetry (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 6, both Frost and Cummings ""favored aspects of the [earlier] Romantic poetry movement…over the tormenting self-doubt that had beset their peers.""  An ideal Frost poem would therefore contain elements typical of Romantic poetry."
"397","The author's suggestion that ""even in an age defined by its pure and absolute originality, Frost and Cummings occupied unique positions within the modernist poetry movement"" can most reasonably be interpreted to mean that the two poets:","A","70","This style…caused some of even the most progressive modernists to dismiss [Cummings'] work as eccentric, self-indulgent, and lacking depth.  However, as a quintessential dissenter, Cummings remained unaffected by the reactions of his contemporaries and focused more on creating a graphic effect with words. (Paragraph 2)
Although many contemporary critics dismissed his work as overly simplistic, or ""too near the level of talk,"" Frost remained unperturbed by such views, holding that poetry sprang from the natural intonations of a person's voice and should remain true to traditional forms. (Paragraph 4)
Yet both poets also continued to exhibit a commitment to the role of nonconformist and favored aspects of the Romantic poetry movement…over the tormenting self-doubt that had beset their peers.  Thus, even in an age defined by its pure and absolute originality, Frost and Cummings occupied unique positions within the modernist poetry movement. (Paragraph 6)
As Paragraph 2 states, ""even some of the most progressive modernists"" deemed Cummings' work ""eccentric (extremely unconventional).""  However, Paragraph 2 describes Cummings as ""unaffected by the reactions of his contemporaries.""  Similarly, in Paragraph 4, Frost's work, though innovative, was considered ""overly simplistic"" and reliant on traditional forms because, unlike his peers, he did not believe in resorting to ""new ways of being new"" to create poetry.  Like Cummings, Frost is described as ""unperturbed"" by these criticisms.
Similarly, Paragraph 6 stresses that ""both poets…continued to exhibit a commitment to the role of nonconformist"" (ie, one who follows his own rules rather than societal norms) and that ""even in an age defined by its pure and absolute originality, Frost and Cummings occupied unique positions within the modernist poetry movement.""
It can therefore be inferred that Frost and Cummings held themselves above the influence of other modernist poets.
(Choice B)  The passage shows that Cummings was ""unaffected"" (Paragraph 2) and Frost ""unperturbed"" (Paragraph 4) by the criticisms of their contemporaries and chose instead to follow their own artistic beliefs.  Paragraph 6 states that each ""continued to exhibit a commitment to the role of nonconformist"" and that both poets ""occupied unique positions within the modernist poetry movement.""  Consequently, Frost and Cummings did not share a creative outlook similar to that of more popular poets.
(Choice C)  Based on the passage, Cummings was ""unaffected by the reaction of his contemporaries"" (Paragraph 2) and Frost ""remained unperturbed"" (Paragraph 4) by the views of his critics.  Accordingly, Frost and Cummings were more concerned with remaining true to their own styles, and the passage never suggests that the successes of their more illustrious (distinguished) peers affected either poet.
(Choice D)  As Paragraph 6 explains, Frost and Cummings ""shared"" with their fellow modernist poets ""an opposition to the scientific rationalism"" of the era.  Accordingly, they held the same anti-rationalism views as their contemporaries and did not stand out in this regard."
"398","Suppose contestants in a poetry competition are asked to author a free verse reminiscent of Cummings' style.  Which of the following is most likely to be found in their submitted work?","D","70","A self-titled ""poet"" and ""painter,"" Cummings was beyond his time in his efforts to innovate.  He would become well known for his erratic applications of punctuation and syntax, and, later, for his visual configurations of words….However, as a quintessential dissenter, Cummings remained unaffected by the reactions of his contemporaries and focused more on creating a graphic effect with words. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 describes Cummings as ""beyond his time in his efforts to innovate.""  It states that ""[h]e would become well known…for his visual configurations of words"" and ""focused…on creating a graphic effect with words.""  This evidence shows that Cummings was interested in generating poems that were unique (novel) and whose texts formed unconventional shapes on the page.
Therefore, in attempting to write verse in a style reminiscent of Cummings, contestants would most likely create a poem with the words of the text configured (arranged) into the shape of (ie, made to look like) a bell curve, as this would reflect the poet's characteristic tendency to play with the visual form of a poem.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 2 indicates that Cummings ""became well known…for his visual configurations of words"" and when writing poetry, ""focused…on creating a graphic effect with words"" on the page.  Consequently, rather than include a drawing next to the text of the poem, Cummings would have made the text itself into a picture.
(Choices B and C)  Paragraph 2 states that Cummings ""would become well known for his erratic (inconsistent) applications (usages) of punctuation and syntax.""  Accordingly, a poem that features consistent application of comma rules would not demonstrate Cummings' artistic practices and would fail to exemplify his spirit of innovation.  Similarly, a poem that displays flawless grammatical structure, such as perfect syntax (the grammatical arrangement of words), would be unlikely to be found in Cummings' body of work."
"399","As used in the passage, the term ""injunction"" is closest in meaning to:","A","70","At the forefront of the modernist poetry movement were T. S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, and others, such as Ezra Pound, whose injunction ""Make it new!"" characterized their artistic approach.  Hindered by the same internal conflict plaguing many intellectuals within the cultural upheaval of the time, these poets felt, on one level, that old linguistic certainties had evaporated and new forms must be embraced. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 makes it clear that Ezra Pound's phrase ""Make it new!"" was addressed to the modernist poets and ""characterized their artistic approach.""  This phrase, referred to as an ""injunction"" in the passage, served as a rallying cry or a call to action for poets to generate new forms and completely original work.  In other words, Pound was giving a command or an instruction, expressed with positive intensity, for poets to be innovative.  Therefore, as used in the passage, the term ""injunction"" is closest in meaning to an enthusiastic instruction.
By contrast, the following phrases would not be as close in meaning to the term ""injunction"" as it is used in the passage:
a solemn statement (Choice B).  The phrase ""Make it new!"" does not make a solemn (serious) statement but gives a strong and enthusiastic command or instruction urging poets to pursue originality.
a temporary constraint (Choice C).  The phrase ""Make it new!"" was intended to urge modernist poets to free themselves from tradition indefinitely.  By contrast, a temporary constraint would be an authoritative (official) instruction intended to restrict someone or something for a period of time.
an urgent plea (Choice D).  Although the phrase ""Make it new!"" communicates some urgency and is punctuated with an exclamation point, it is not a plea (ie, a pressing and emotional request) but a command or instruction."
"400","Based on passage information, at the time of his sudden death in 1922, Rorschach was most likely intending:","A","71","Having observed that his patients with schizophrenia gave distinctly different responses from the control group, Rorschach envisioned his experiment as a diagnostic tool for the disease.  Nevertheless, he resisted the notion that its results could be used to assess personality.  In fact, until his untimely death from a ruptured appendix in 1922, Rorschach referred to his project as an ""interpretive form experiment"" rather than a test. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, ""Having observed that his patients with schizophrenia gave distinctly different responses from the control group, Rorschach envisioned his experiment as a diagnostic tool for the disease.""  Furthermore, Rorschach ""referred to his project as an 'interpretive form experiment' rather than a test,"" indicating that in the future he might revise it in some way or reimagine its usage.
This information indicates not only that Rorschach's research focus was schizophrenia but also that he was considering how in the future clinicians might be able to use his new ""interpretive form experiment"" to diagnose the disease.  Therefore, based on passage information, at the time of his sudden death in 1922, Rorschach was most likely intending to continue his clinical research on schizophrenia.
  (Choice B)  to adapt the inkblot test to diagnose other disorders.  According to Paragraph 4, Rorschach observed that ""his patients with schizophrenia gave distinctly different responses from the control group.""  As a result, he ""envisioned his experiment as a diagnostic tool for the disease.""  However, the passage never suggests that Rorschach intended to adapt his test to diagnose any other types of disorders besides schizophrenia.
(Choice C)  to publish a second volume of Psychodiagnostics.  Paragraph 2 states that ""[t]he now iconic inkblots were introduced to the world by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach in his 1921 book Psychodiagnostics.""  According to Paragraph 4, while conducting research, Rorschach observed that ""his patients with schizophrenia gave distinctly different responses from the control group.""  As a result, Rorschach then ""envisioned his experiment as a diagnostic tool for [schizophrenia].""  However, the passage never suggests that Rorschach intended to publish a second volume of Psychodiagnostics.
(Choice D)  to develop an alternative method to assess personality.  According to Paragraph 4, Rorschach ""envisioned his experiment as a diagnostic tool"" for schizophrenia yet ""resisted the notion that its results could be used to assess personality.""  Thus, Rorschach wanted to reserve the diagnostic capabilities of his experiment for schizophrenia and was against using his work as a tool to assess personality.  Furthermore, the passage never suggests that he intended to develop an alternative method of personality assessment."
"401","Given the information in the passage, the author most likely believes that the way we process visual information:","C","71","Traditionally, psychoanalysts had relied on language for insights; however, …Rorschach's theories would exemplify the principle that ""who we are is a matter less of what we say than of what we see.""  Indeed, through a process of perception termed pareidolia, the mind projects meaning onto images, detecting in them familiar objects or shapes.  Consequently, what a person sees in an image reveals more about that person than about the image itself. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 indicates that ""Rorschach's theories…exemplify the principle that 'who we are is a matter less of what we say than of what we see.'""  The author then points out that ""through a process of perception termed pareidolia, the mind projects meaning onto images, detecting in them familiar objects or shapes.""  As a result of this process, ""what a person sees in an image reveals more about that person than about the image itself.""  Therefore, given the information in the passage, the author most likely believes that the way we process visual information is an integral element of a person's psychological makeup.
  (Choice A)  had been an important factor in psychology long before Rorschach.  Paragraph 2 conveys that ""in a recently published dissertation, [Rorschach's] colleague Szymon Hens had used inkblots to try to probe the imagination of research subjects"" and that ""a few years earlier, the French psychologist…Alfred Binet had used them to measure creativity.""  However, as Paragraph 3 notes, ""Traditionally, psychoanalysts had relied on language for insights,"" while, by contrast, ""Rorschach's theories would exemplify the principle that 'who we are is a matter less of what we say than of what we see.'""  Accordingly, the author indicates that the way we process visual information became an important consideration in psychological research only in the years just prior to Rorschach.
(Choice B)  was initially overemphasized by Rorschach.  According to Paragraph 2, ""[R]eading Freud's work on dream symbolism prompted [Rorschach] to recall his childhood passion for…Klecksographie (inkblot art).""  Aware that others had been using inkblots in psychological research, Rorschach ""decided to revisit the childhood pastime that had awakened his curiosity about how visual information is processed.  In particular, he wondered why different people saw different things in the same image"" (Paragraph 3).  Therefore, the passage indicates that from early on in his thinking, Rorschach emphasized the way we process visual information; however, the author never suggests that his emphasis was initially excessive.
(Choice D)  interferes with the psychologist's ability to gain insight into an individual's personality.  Paragraph 3 explains that ""through a process of perception termed pareidolia, the mind projects meaning onto images, detecting in them familiar objects or shapes.  Consequently, what a person sees in an image reveals more about that person than about the image itself.""  Based on this information, the way we process visual information would enhance rather than interfere with the psychologist's ability to gain insight into an individual's personality."
"402","The passage author suggests which of the following statements about the Rorschach test?","B","71","For almost 100 years now, the psychological evaluation known as the Rorschach Inkblot Test has engendered much controversy, including skepticism about its value, questions about its scoring, and, especially, criticism of its interpretive methods as too subjective. (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, ""[T]he Rorschach Inkblot Test has engendered much controversy, including skepticism about its value, questions about its scoring, and, especially, criticism of its interpretive methods as too subjective.""  This criticism suggests that the way in which the test is interpreted may allow test-givers to bring their own viewpoints or biases to bear on test-takers' responses, possibly skewing results.  Consequently, the passage author suggests that the test's interpretation may be more subject to bias than other psychological tests.
  (Choice A)  Its results often contradict the findings of other types of psychological tests.  Paragraph 1 states that ""the Rorschach Inkblot Test has engendered much controversy, including skepticism about its value, questions about its scoring, and, especially, criticism of its interpretive methods as too subjective.""  Paragraph 5 later echoes this sentiment, stating that despite ""nearly incessant scrutiny…doubts about [the test's] validity and reliability persist.""  However, while the passage author conveys criticism and doubts about the Rorschach test, he or she never suggests that the test's results often contradict the findings of other types of psychological tests.
(Choice C)  It tends to misrepresent the personality traits of the test-taker.  According to Paragraph 3, ""Rorschach's theories would exemplify the principle that 'who we are is a matter less of what we say than of what we see.'""  As Paragraph 3 further explains, ""[T]hrough a process of perception termed pareidolia, the mind projects meaning onto images, detecting in them familiar objects or shapes.""  Given this process, ""what a person sees in an image reveals more about that person than about the image itself.""  Consequently, the passage author suggests that the Rorschach test tends to reveal rather than misrepresent the personality traits of the test-taker.
(Choice D)  It should not be used as part of a personality assessment.  According to Paragraph 4, although ""Rorschach envisioned his experiment as a diagnostic tool for [schizophrenia]…he resisted the notion that its results could be used to assess personality.""  As Paragraph 4 also indicates, ""Ironically…by the 1960s, the Rorschach Inkblot Test was known chiefly as a personality assessment and had become the most frequently administered projective personality test in the US.""  However, the passage author only reports the conflict surrounding the usage of the Rorschach test without offering an opinion about whether the test should be used as part of a personality assessment."
"403","Which of the following passage claims is the LEAST supported by passage evidence?","C","71","For almost 100 years now, the psychological evaluation known as the Rorschach Inkblot Test has engendered much controversy, including skepticism about its value, questions about its scoring, and, especially, criticism of its interpretive methods as too subjective.  Thus, the Rorschach test, which emerged from the same early twentieth-century zeitgeist that produced Einstein's physics, Freudian psychoanalysis, and abstract art, seems one of modernity's most misbegotten children. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 states that the Rorschach Inkblot Test ""emerged from the same early twentieth-century zeitgeist (ie, the characteristic spirit of a time period) that produced Einstein's physics, Freudian psychoanalysis, and abstract art,"" identifying it as one of that zeitgeist's strangest offspring.  However, the passage provides no further information about either the zeitgeist or Einstein's physics.  Consequently, the claim that Rorschach's test emerged from the same zeitgeist that produced Einstein's physics is not supported by any passage evidence.
  By contrast, all the following claims are supported by passage evidence:
Rorschach's work remained a perennial outlier in its field (Choice A).  Paragraph 1 conveys that for nearly a century, ""the psychological evaluation known as the Rorschach Inkblot Test has engendered much controversy, including skepticism about its value, questions about its scoring, and, especially, criticism of its interpretive methods as too subjective.""  Furthermore, the test is described as ""one of modernity's most misbegotten children,"" and as ""[d]estined never to be completely accepted or discredited"" but to be ""a perennial (ie, lasting a long time or permanently) outlier in its field.""  Accordingly, the passage attests to the Rorschach test's enduring status as an outlier.
Rorschach's inkblots were conspicuous for their ambiguity (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 4, ""Rorschach experimented with countless inkblots, eventually selecting ten…each of which he was said to have 'meticulously (painstakingly) designed to be as ambiguous and ""conflicted"" as possible.'""  Thus, the passage strongly suggests that the inkblots exhibited extreme ambiguity.
Rorschach's research involved the process of perception called pareidolia (Choice D).  Paragraph 3 conveys Searls' report that, in contrast to traditional psychoanalysis, ""Rorschach's theories would exemplify the principle that 'who we are is a matter less of what we say than of what we see.'""  Paragraph 3 then elaborates on why this is the case: ""through a process of perception termed pareidolia, the mind projects meaning onto images, detecting in them familiar objects or shapes.""  As a result of this process, ""what a person sees in an image reveals more about that person than about the image itself.""  Thus, pareidolia demonstrates Rorschach's notion that what we see (for example, in the inkblots) reflects who we are.  Consequently, the passage establishes that the process of pareidolia was intertwined with Rorschach's research."
"404","The author's attitude toward the passage topic can best be described as:","D","71","For almost 100 years now, the psychological evaluation known as the Rorschach Inkblot Test has engendered much controversy, including skepticism about its value, questions about its scoring, and, especially, criticism of its interpretive methods as too subjective….  Destined never to be completely accepted or discredited, the test remains a perennial outlier in its field.  Nevertheless, the inkblots' mystery and aesthetic appeal have caused them to be indelibly printed on our cultural fabric. (Paragraph 1)
Rorschach's test has survived nearly incessant scrutiny…yet doubts about its validity and reliability persist. Much like the inkblots themselves—which tantalize us with the possibility of divulging the secrets of who we are and how we see the world—the test has (for better or worse) defied attempts to fix its meaning.  Thus, what has been called ""the twentieth century's most visionary synthesis of art and science"" stands tempered by harsh criticism. (Paragraph 5)
In Paragraph 1, the author states that ""the Rorschach Inkblot Test has engendered much controversy, including skepticism about its value, questions about its scoring, and, especially, criticism of its interpretive methods as too subjective.""  The author then observes, ""Destined never to be completely accepted or discredited, the test remains a perennial (ie, lasting a long time or permanently) outlier in its field.""  However, the author also notes that ""the inkblots' mystery and aesthetic (artistic) appeal have caused them to be indelibly printed on our cultural fabric.""
Similarly, in Paragraph 5, the author reports that the inkblot test ""has survived nearly incessant scrutiny…yet doubts about its validity and reliability persist.""  On the other hand, as the author remarks, ""the inkblots…tantalize us with the possibility of divulging the secrets of who we are and how we see the world"" even though ""the test has…defied attempts to fix its meaning.""  Overall, the author claims that ""what has been called 'the twentieth century's most visionary synthesis of art and science' stands tempered by harsh criticism.""
This information demonstrates that the passage author is trying to embrace both sides of the Rorschach controversy and to adopt a broad viewpoint.  Therefore, the author's attitude toward the passage topic can best be described as open.
 By contrast, the author's attitude is not best described as:
dismissive (Choice A).  The author refers to the Rorschach test as ""one of modernity's most misbegotten children"" and ""a perennial outlier in its field"" (Paragraph 1).  However, the author does not present these dismissive comments as definitive or as wholly characteristic of the test; rather, he or she proclaims the test ""'the twentieth century's most visionary synthesis of art and science'"" (Paragraph 5).
critical (Choice B).  In Paragraph 1, the author states that ""the Rorschach Inkblot Test has engendered much controversy, including skepticism about its value, questions about its scoring, and, especially, criticism of its interpretive methods as too subjective.""  In Paragraph 5, the author underscores that ""doubts about [the Rorschach test's] validity and reliability persist.""  However, such criticisms are merely reported, not endorsed by the author.
affirming (Choice C).  In Paragraph 1, the author claims that ""the inkblots' mystery and aesthetic (artistic) appeal have caused them to be indelibly printed on our cultural fabric.""  Similarly, in Paragraph 5, the author conveys that the Rorschach test has been called ""'the twentieth century's most visionary synthesis of art and science.'""  However, the author is not exhibiting an affirming attitude toward the passage topic; instead, he or she is reporting positive observations without indicating actual agreement."
"405","Which of the following conclusions can most reasonably be drawn from passage information?","B","72","For many who dare to wield the pen, writer's block is not just an occupational hazard but a symptom of a far deeper malaise. (Paragraph 1)
But perhaps no one has delineated the ubiquitous writer's malady with more pathos than Viennese poet and dramatist Hugo von Hofmannsthal in his 1902 Ein Brief (A Letter). (Paragraph 2)
Hofmannsthal's poignant epistle portended a crisis of language so common among writers in the first half of the twentieth century it led Austrian psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler to coin the term ""writer's block"" in 1947. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 1 states that writer's block occurs to ""many who dare to wield the pen,"" stressing that it constitutes ""an occupational hazard.""  Likewise, Paragraph 2 underscores the condition's prevalence, referring to it as ""the ubiquitous (present everywhere) writer's malady.""  Finally, with its fictional account of an extreme experience of writer's block, Hofmannsthal's Ein Brief (A Letter) ""portended (foretold) a crisis of language so common among writers in the first half of the twentieth century it led Austrian psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler to coin the term 'writer's block' in 1947"" (Paragraph 5).
Accordingly, the passage implies that far from a purely subjective condition, writer's block is a common phenomenon, observable by others, and thus meriting an official label within the field of psychology.  Hence, the conclusion that can most reasonably be drawn from passage information is that writer's block is not purely subjective; it has been observed frequently enough to warrant its own terminology.
 By contrast, none of the following conclusions can reasonably be drawn from passage information:
Writer's block can be avoided only by sufficiently conscientious authors (Choice A).  The passage never suggests that some authors can escape the widespread problem now known as writer's block.  According to Paragraph 1, the condition is both ""an occupational hazard"" and ""a symptom of a far deeper malaise (uneasiness)"" manifesting in reduced productivity.  For example, due to writer's block, the 20-year-old poet Arthur Rimbaud ""ceased versifying altogether"" and Paul Valéry was unable to write for ""two decades.""  Similarly, Hofmannsthal's fictional Lord Chandos, a ""previously prolific writer"" (Paragraph 3), now ""bemoans two years elapsed without writing"" (Paragraph 2).  Therefore, the passage depicts writer's block as a virtually universal problem that even the most conscientious and productive writer might face.
Authors of today have more resources to deal with the phenomenon of writer's block (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 5, the inability to write affected so many authors in the twentieth century it led ""Austrian psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler to coin the term 'writer's block' in 1947.""  Although this information indicates an increased awareness of the phenomenon, the passage never suggests that contemporary authors actually have more resources to deal with writer's block.
Writer's block may be subjective; its effects are too idiosyncratic to constitute an identifiable phenomenon (Choice D).  Throughout the passage, the inability to write and a kind of linguistic crisis are shown to be the dominant effects of what we now call writer's block.  Since these effects are universal and consistent rather than idiosyncratic, they constitute an identifiable pattern or phenomenon.  Furthermore, as Paragraph 5 reports, Hofmannsthal's Chandos letter ""portended (foretold) a crisis of language so common among writers in the first half of the twentieth century"" that an official term, ""writer's block,"" was coined.  The coinage is the result of the condition's prevalence and highly recognizable nature and thus evidence of its status as a genuine, observable, and hence, objective (rather than subjective) phenomenon. "
"406","Based on the passage, both Romantic and Symbolist poets:","D","72","In the early nineteenth century, poets with Romantic proclivities equated creativity with an unseen and uncontrollable force that, like a fickle wind, either infused the writer or passed him by.  As the twentieth century approached, Symbolist poets who suffered verbal paralysis tended to blame their silence on the inadequacies of language itself.  They struggled, says one researcher, with ""how to get past its vague, cliché-crammed character and arrive at the nature of experience.""  Whatever its cause, a blockage's outcome is unpredictable: in 1874, the precocious Arthur Rimbaud, then age 20, ceased versifying altogether, while fellow Symbolist poet Paul Valéry deserted the métier for two decades. (Paragraph 1)
The passage presents the different ways in which the Romantic and Symbolist poets conceptualized writer's block.  As Paragraph 1 observes, ""In the early nineteenth century, poets with Romantic proclivities (tendencies) equated creativity with an unseen and uncontrollable force that, like a fickle wind, either infused the writer or passed him by.""  By contrast, the passage notes that the later ""Symbolist poets who suffered verbal paralysis tended to blame their silence on the inadequacies of language itself.""
Thus, the passage conveys the Romantic and Symbolist poets' respective views on writer's block and its possible causes.  Accordingly, both Romantic and Symbolist poets have been known to speculate about writer's block and its origins.
 (Choice A)  held the notion that a writer's creativity was like a fickle wind.  According to Paragraph 1, ""poets with Romantic proclivities equated creativity with an unseen and uncontrollable force that, like a fickle wind, either infused the writer or passed him by.""  However, the Symbolist poets did not share this view of writer's block; instead, they ""tended to blame their silence on the inadequacies of language itself.""  Therefore, while Romantic poets did believe that creativity was like a fickle wind, Symbolist poets did not.
(Choice B)  were representative of an unprolific period in the history of poetry.  Paragraph 1 indicates that writer's block caused some poets to be less productive.  For example, the poet Arthur Rimbaud ""ceased versifying altogether"" by the time he was 20, ""while fellow Symbolist poet Paul Valéry deserted the métier (vocation) for two decades.""  However, the passage never evaluates the relative productivity of poets belonging to a specific historical period.
(Choice C)  thought writing difficulties were primarily due to personal crises.  Paragraph 1 presents some possible causes of writer's block.  For instance, the Romantic poets ""equated creativity with an unseen and uncontrollable force"" that can pass a writer by, while the later Symbolist poets ""tended to blame their silence on the inadequacies of language itself.""  Accordingly, in contrast to the experience of Hofmannsthal's Chandos, whose writing difficulties are shown to stem from a personal linguistic crisis, neither group of poets thought that their writing problems were primarily due to personal crises or internal issues.  Instead, both Romantic and Symbolist poets believed their writing difficulties were largely the result of external influences."
"407","What does the passage suggest about writer's block?","C","72","For many who dare to wield the pen, writer's block is not just an occupational hazard but a symptom of a far deeper malaise. (Paragraph 1)
But perhaps no one has delineated the ubiquitous writer's malady with more pathos than Viennese poet and dramatist Hugo von Hofmannsthal in his 1902 Ein Brief (A Letter). (Paragraph 2)
Hofmannsthal's poignant epistle portended a crisis of language so common among writers in the first half of the twentieth century it led Austrian psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler to coin the term ""writer's block"" in 1947. (Paragraph 5)
The passage indicates that most writers suffer from writer's block at some point.  According to Paragraph 1, ""For many who dare to wield the pen,"" writer's block constitutes ""an occupational hazard"" in addition to being ""a symptom of a far deeper malaise (uneasiness).""  Similarly, in speaking of ""the ubiquitous (present everywhere) writer's malady,"" Paragraph 2 emphasizes that writer's block is a particularly widespread phenomenon, affecting the majority of writers.
Finally, Paragraph 5 conveys how Hofmannsthal's fictional letter or Ein Brief ""portended (foretold) a crisis of language so common among writers in the first half of the twentieth century it led Austrian psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler to coin the term 'writer's block' in 1947.""  Accordingly, the passage suggests that many writers endure writer's block.
 (Choice A)  Writer's block is the fault of the writer.  Paragraph 1 describes the phenomenon of writer's block as ""not just an occupational hazard but a symptom of a far deeper malaise"" and explores its possible causes.  For example, ""poets with Romantic proclivities (tendencies) equated creativity with an unseen and uncontrollable force that, like a fickle wind, either infused the writer or passed him by.""  Later, the Symbolist poets ""tended to blame their silence on the inadequacies of language itself.""  Moreover, even though Hofmannsthal's fictional Ein Brief portrays writer's block as a personal crisis of language, that crisis is not blamed on the writer.  Thus, the passage discusses some possible causes of the phenomenon, but never suggests that writer's block is the fault of the writer.
(Choice B)  Writer's block unfolds in predictable ways.  Paragraph 1 underscores that the ultimate effects of writer's block cannot be known in advance: ""Whatever its cause, a blockage's outcome is unpredictable.""  Two different cases are then offered as examples: Arthur Rimbaud, who at age 20 ""ceased versifying altogether,"" and Paul Valéry, who ""deserted the métier (vocation) for two decades.""  Furthermore, Paragraph 5 notes how Hofmannsthal eventually recovered from writer's block to become a renowned librettist (writer of opera texts).
(Choice D)  Most writers eventually overcome writer's block.  The passage offers examples to show that the outcome of writer's block is entirely ""unpredictable.""  Paragraph 1 mentions Rimbaud, who ""ceased versifying altogether"" at age 20, then Valéry, who did not write poetry for 20 years.  In Paragraph 4, the fictional Chandos, having experienced a linguistic crisis, ""admits…he will never write another book.""  Later, Paragraph 5 discusses Hofmannsthal's prior ""estrangement from his craft"" and his extraordinary ability to rehabilitate himself and so ""eventually win renown as the chief librettist of opera composer Richard Strauss.""  Accordingly, the passage shows that some, but not most writers are able to eventually overcome writer's block.  Indeed, the passage indicates that there is no typical outcome for the malady, only a variety of possible outcomes, including full recovery."
"408","Based on passage information, the author would likely agree that the phenomenon of writer's block:","A","72","For many who dare to wield the pen, writer's block is not just an occupational hazard but a symptom of a far deeper malaise. (Paragraph 1)
But perhaps no one has delineated the ubiquitous writer's malady with more pathos than Viennese poet and dramatist Hugo von Hofmannsthal in his 1902 Ein Brief (A Letter). (Paragraph 2)
Hofmannsthal's poignant epistle portended a crisis of language so common among writers in the first half of the twentieth century it led Austrian psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler to coin the term ""writer's block"" in 1947. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 1 opens with the statement that ""[f]or many who dare to wield the pen, writer's block is…an occupational hazard.""  This statement suggests not only that writers run the risk of experiencing a blockage, but that this is almost inevitable.  The prevalence of writer's block is then reinforced throughout the passage.  For instance, Paragraph 2 refers to the condition as ""the ubiquitous (present everywhere) writer's malady.""  According to Paragraph 5, Hofmannsthal's account of the fictional Lord Chandos' experience with writer's block is said to have ""portended (foretold) a crisis of language so common among writers in the first half of the twentieth century it led Austrian psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler to coin the term 'writer's block' in 1947.""
Consequently, the passage suggests that many writers suffer from writer's block at some point during their career due to the very nature of their craft.  Therefore, the author would likely agree that the phenomenon of writer's block constitutes an inherent risk of the creative process.
 By contrast, the author would not likely agree that the phenomenon of writer's block:
is inadequately portrayed by Hofmannsthal (Choice B).  In Paragraph 2, the author stresses that ""perhaps no one has delineated the ubiquitous writer's malady with more pathos (intensity of feeling) than Viennese poet and dramatist Hugo von Hofmannsthal in his 1902 Ein Brief (A Letter).""  Based on Hofmannsthal's text, the author then conveys Chandos' experience in its abundant detail, holding it up as an extreme and vivid example of the phenomenon.
acquired its familiar name before Hofmannsthal's Chandos letter (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 5, Hofmannsthal's 1902 letter ""portended (foretold) a crisis of language so common among writers in the first half of the twentieth century it led Austrian psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler to coin the term 'writer's block' in 1947.""  Given these dates, the phenomenon could have acquired its now familiar name only after Hofmannsthal's Chandos letter.
was first reported in Hofmannsthal's Chandos letter (Choice D).  Paragraph 1 provides some historical background to the phenomenon now known as writer's block: ""In the early nineteenth century, poets with Romantic proclivities (tendencies) equated creativity with an unseen and uncontrollable force that, like a fickle wind, either infused the writer or passed him by.""  Based on this timeframe, nineteenth-century writers would have reported the phenomenon of being blocked or unable to write prior to the 1902 publication of Hofmannsthal's Chandos letter."
"409","The author's main purpose in the passage is to:","B","72","For many who dare to wield the pen, writer's block is not just an occupational hazard but a symptom of a far deeper malaise.  In the early nineteenth century, poets with Romantic proclivities equated creativity with an unseen and uncontrollable force that, like a fickle wind, either infused the writer or passed him by.  As the twentieth century approached, Symbolist poets who suffered verbal paralysis tended to blame their silence on the inadequacies of language itself….  Whatever its cause, a blockage's outcome is unpredictable…. (Paragraph 1)
But perhaps no one has delineated the ubiquitous writer's malady with more pathos than Viennese poet and dramatist Hugo von Hofmannsthal in his 1902 Ein Brief (A Letter). (Paragraph 2)
Hofmannsthal's poignant epistle portended a crisis of language so common among writers in the first half of the twentieth century it led Austrian psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler to coin the term ""writer's block"" in 1947.  Ein Brief also epitomized Hofmannsthal's own estrangement from his craft as three years earlier the muse had forsaken this poetic prodigy.  However, for Hofmannsthal, unlike the fictional Chandos or the real-life Rimbaud, rehabilitation followed inhibition: he would eventually win renown as the chief librettist of opera composer Richard Strauss. (Paragraph 5)
Each passage section explores some aspect(s) of the phenomenon now known as writer's block.  Calling the condition ""an occupational hazard"" that suggests a deeper disorder, the author examines its possible origins in Paragraph 1.  For example, Romantic poets ""equated creativity with an unseen and uncontrollable force that…either infused the writer or passed him by.""  By contrast, the Symbolist poets were said ""to blame their silence on the inadequacies of language itself.""  The author also stresses that a block's outcome is ultimately ""unpredictable,"" as evidenced by the respective experiences of Rimbaud and Valéry.
According to Paragraph 2, ""perhaps no one has delineated the ubiquitous (present everywhere) writer's malady with more pathos (intensity of feeling) than Viennese poet and dramatist Hugo von Hofmannsthal in his 1902 Ein Brief (A Letter).""  The personal linguistic crisis suffered by his fictional Lord Chandos is then detailed.
Paragraph 5 concludes that the Chandos letter ""portended (foretold) a crisis of language so common among writers in the first half of the twentieth century it led Austrian psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler to coin the term 'writer's block' in 1947.""  Lastly, the passage reports Hofmannsthal's own experience with a blockage from which he seemed to fully recover.  Hence, the main purpose of the passage is to investigate facets of the phenomenon of writer's block.
 (Choice A) analyze the wavering productivity experienced by many writers.  In exploring writer's block, the passage touches on the issue of productivity.  For example, Rimbaud ""ceased versifying altogether"" at 20 years old, ""while fellow Symbolist poet Paul Valéry deserted the métier (vocation) for two decades"" (Paragraph 1).  Likewise, the fictional Chandos is portrayed as a ""previously prolific (productive) writer"" (Paragraph 3) who became blocked.  Furthermore, according to Paragraph 5, Hofmannsthal himself experienced a blockage, eventually recovering to become a successful librettist (writer of opera texts).  Thus, in examining writer's block, the passage reports on the fluctuating productivity of a few writers rather than analyzing changes in the productivity of many writers.
(Choice C) recreate a seventeenth-century experience of writer's block.  Paragraph 2 describes Hofmannsthal's Chandos letter as a ""short but dense fictional work [that] takes the form of an early seventeenth-century missive (letter) addressed to the English philosopher and scientist Sir Francis Bacon.""  However, while the letter's fictional author, Lord Chandos, is imagined as Bacon's contemporary, his experience with writer's block is not presented from a seventeenth-century perspective.  Moreover, Hofmannsthal composed this text at the very beginning of the twentieth century after being blocked himself.
(Choice D) offer hope to creative writers who strive to be more productive.  Paragraph 5 reports that Hofmannsthal had suffered ""estrangement from his craft,"" but ""would eventually win renown as the chief librettist of opera composer Richard Strauss.""  Such an example might seem to offer blocked writers hope for their own rehabilitation.  However, the passage also discusses cases with less favorable outcomes, such as those of Rimbaud and the fictional Chandos, and explores the condition's origins and effects."
"410","The ""economic marginality"" and ""occupational plurality"" the author describes in Paragraph 4 constitute:","A","73","This is not…to say that life on the Aran isles was ever easy; in fact…[it] demanded a delicate equilibrium, and in the face of economic marginality most households resorted to occupational plurality—to include any combination of fishing, agriculture, kelp-making, boat-making, fowling, textiles, and manual labor. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 indicates that life on the Aran Islands ""demanded a delicate equilibrium (balance)"" and was characterized by ""economic marginality"" (ie, the economy was unstable and limited).  Consequently, ""most households resorted to occupational plurality,"" meaning that most people sought to diversify, or increase the number and type of jobs that they did in order to increase their income.  Therefore, the ""economic marginality"" and ""occupational plurality"" the author describes in Paragraph 4 constitute a model of how job diversification can bolster (strengthen) economic stability.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 4 discusses different possible types of occupations available to the ""denizens (inhabitants) of Inishmore,"" such as ""kelp-making, boat-making, fowling, textiles, and manual labor.""  However, the passage never indicates that there was job growth, meaning an increase in either the number or types of jobs available on the island.  Therefore, ""economic marginality"" and ""occupational plurality"" do not constitute an example of how job growth can improve dire financial circumstances.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 4 presents ""occupational plurality"" as part of an ""ever-shifting quest for resources"" and as one possible way for the inhabitants of Inishmore to maintain the ""delicate balance"" of their ""lifestyle"" during the 19th century.  However, the passage never suggests that ""economic marginality"" and ""occupational plurality"" constitute an inevitable (unavoidable) condition of island life.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 4 presents ""occupational plurality"" (having multiple jobs or sources of income) as a strategy for balancing ""economic marginality"" (an unstable and limited economic base) on Inishmore.  This economic situation represented ""a delicate balance"" and ""an ever-shifting quest for resources"" that allowed the inhabitants to achieve a basic or modest level of prosperity before tourism took hold.  Paragraph 5 then indicates that, at some point, these islanders became ""heavily reliant on the outside—particularly on a tourist industry""—for their economic survival ""rather than [being] self-sufficient.""  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that ""economic marginality"" and ""occupational plurality"" constitute an optimum (best possible) situation for economic self-sufficiency."
"411","Based on the passage, the marketing of the Man of Aran sweater indicates that inhabitants of Inishmore are:","B","73","Eighty years later, this image of Aran life endures, perpetuating a myth that has arguably become a commodity as real as the Man of Aran sweater sold on Inishmore but typically knit elsewhere in Ireland—a symbol of the island's dual character, of its commercial nature that so patently contradicts its celebrated identity as isolated and self-sufficient.  Still, the persistence of this image of remoteness, exposure, and inexorable hardship, however fabricated or embellished, has helped the island reinvent its economy as one heavily reliant on the outside—particularly on a tourist industry that brings in as many as 2,000 visitors a day by ferry—rather than self-sufficient. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 describes the Man of Aran sweater as ""sold on Inishmore but typically knit elsewhere in Ireland.""  Paragraph 5 also states that the sweater is ""a symbol of the island's dual character, of its commercial nature that so patently (openly) contradicts its celebrated identity as isolated and self-sufficient.""  Moreover, ""the persistence of this image of remoteness, exposure, and inexorable hardship…has helped the island reinvent its economy as one heavily reliant…on a tourist industry…rather than self-sufficient.""
This evidence shows that islanders are deliberately trying to sell the ""myth"" or ""image"" of the Aran Islands along with the sweaters to make a profit.  Therefore, the marketing of the Man of Aran sweater indicates that inhabitants of Inishmore are essentially commercial.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 5 states that the Man of Aran sweater was ""sold on Inishmore but typically knit elsewhere in Ireland"" and that it was ""a symbol of the island's dual character, of its commercial nature that so patently contradicts its celebrated identity as isolated and self-sufficient.""  Although this evidence may indicate that inhabitants are using the island's ""image of remoteness, exposure, and inexorable hardship"" to sell more sweaters, the passage does not support the idea that inhabitants of Inishmore are corrupt business people (ie, engaged in illegal or unjust practices to make money).
(Choice C)  Paragraph 5 describes the image of the Aran Islands marketed through the Man of Aran sweater as one of ""remoteness, exposure, and inexorable hardship…[that] has helped the island reinvent its economy as one heavily reliant on the outside—particularly on a tourist industry…rather than self-sufficient.""  Although the sweater is marketed through the outdated but persistent image of the Aran Islands as self-sufficient, this marketing does not indicate that inhabitants of Inishmore are fiercely independent.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 5 states that the Man of Aran sweater was ""sold on Inishmore but typically knit elsewhere in Ireland.""  The passage also reveals that marketing the Aran image of ""remoteness, exposure, and inexorable hardship"" through the sweater ""has helped the island reinvent its economy as one heavily reliant…on a tourist industry…rather than self-sufficient.""  Accordingly, the marketing of the Man of Aran sweater does not indicate that inhabitants of Inishmore are passive or inefficient but, rather, shows them to be active and efficient in reinventing their economy."
"412","Based on the passage, which of the following BEST characterizes the most recent economy of Inishmore?","A","73","Eighty years later, this image of Aran life endures, perpetuating a myth that has arguably become a commodity as real as the Man of Aran sweater sold on Inishmore but typically knit elsewhere in Ireland—a symbol of the island's dual character, of its commercial nature that so patently contradicts its celebrated identity as isolated and self-sufficient.  Still, the persistence of this image of remoteness, exposure, and inexorable hardship, however fabricated or embellished, has helped the island reinvent its economy as one heavily reliant on the outside—particularly on a tourist industry that brings in as many as 2,000 visitors a day by ferry—rather than self-sufficient. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 describes the island's ""celebrated identity"" as ""isolated and self-sufficient"" and states that ""the persistence of this image of remoteness, exposure and inexorable hardship…has helped the island reinvent its economy as…reliant on the outside, particularly on a [flourishing] tourist industry.""  Therefore, the most recent economy of Inishmore would be best characterized as largely focused on adapting to the demands of the tourist industry.
By contrast, the most recent Inishmore economy would not be best characterized as:
Solely dependent on foreign perceptions for its prosperity (Choice B).  Paragraph 5 describes tourists as drawn largely to Inishmore by an external image or foreign perception of ""remoteness, exposure, and inexorable hardship.""  Moreover, ""the persistence of this image…however, fabricated or embellished…has helped the island to reinvent its economy as one heavily reliant on the outside,"" particularly on tourism.  However, tourism is not the island's only source of prosperity: Paragraph 3 discusses the inhabitants' resourcefulness in having developed other profitable industries such as fishing and kelp-making.
Consistently substandard but entirely autonomous (Choice C).  Paragraph 3 indicates that Inishmore's economy used to be more self-sufficient (ie, autonomous) and subsistent (at maintenance level or substandard), but ""by the early 19th century,"" the island had established several industries that depended on trade with the mainland and boosted the economy, in particular, the ""thriving, if seasonal"" kelp industry.  More importantly, Paragraph 5 reveals that the economy is now ""heavily reliant on the outside—particularly on a tourist industry"" and that this industry is flourishing.
Mainly dependent on the resourcefulness of its citizens (Choice D).  Paragraph 3 depicts 19th-century Inishmore citizens as able to ""effectively counterbalance the meagerness of their island's natural resources by swiftly focusing on new and evermore efficient ways to exploit them.""  Moreover, Paragraph 4 depicts the citizens as later resourceful in multiplying their occupations when faced with ""economic marginality.""  Paragraph 5, however, makes it clear that Inishmore's economy is now ""heavily reliant on the outside—particularly on a [flourishing] tourist industry."""
"413","Suppose that the tourist industry on Inishmore were to decline sharply, resulting in a substantial economic loss.  Based on the information in the passage, the author would be most likely to advise the inhabitants to:","D","73","Seaweed could also be harvested by the ton and burnt in kilns to produce kelp, the sale of which on the mainland continues to be a thriving, if seasonal, industry, often more reliable than fishing. (Paragraph 3)
In describing the development of profitable industries on Inishmore, Paragraph 3 cites ""the abundance of seaweed off its shores"" and explains that ""seaweed could…be harvested by the ton and burnt in kilns to produce kelp, the sale of which on the mainland continues to be a thriving, if seasonal, industry, often more reliable than fishing.""  These facts suggest the author would be most likely to advise the inhabitants to increase the production and export of the abundant kelp as a way to help compensate for the economic loss caused by a sharp decline in the tourism industry.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 2 describes Inishmore as ""a landscape whose barrenness offered an almost equal shortage of arable (suitable for growing crops and raising livestock) land and surface water.""  Moreover, as Paragraph 3 indicates that ""most of the boulders"" had already been ""cleared away"" to create more land on Inishmore, further expansion would be quite limited.  Accordingly, the author would be unlikely to advise the inhabitants to create more arable land to compensate for the substantial economic loss caused by a decline in tourism.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 5 describes the Man of Aran sweater as ""sold on Inishmore but typically knit elsewhere in Ireland.""  The passage also refers to the sweater as a ""commodity"" that sells the ""image"" or ""myth"" of life on the Aran islands.  This description indicates that the sweater is primarily marketed and sold to tourists, and so a sharp decrease in tourism would cause a sharp decrease in sweater sales.  Consequently, the author would be unlikely to advise Inishmore inhabitants to manufacture such a tourist-dependent product to help compensate for the economic loss from a sharp decline in tourism.
(Choice C)  Paragraph 3 states that the fishing industry on Inishmore was often less ""reliable"" than the kelp industry.  Therefore, the author would be unlikely to advise the inhabitants to expand the sale of seafood to the mainland to make up for a sharply declining tourist industry."
"414","The information that Inishmore is now particularly favored as a place of tourism is NOT plausibly connected to which of the following assertions?  Inishmore:","D","73","Eighty years later, this image of Aran life endures, perpetuating a myth that has arguably become a commodity as real as the Man of Aran sweater sold on Inishmore but typically knit elsewhere in Ireland—a symbol of the island's dual character, of its commercial nature that so patently contradicts its celebrated identity as isolated and self-sufficient.  Still, the persistence of this image of remoteness, exposure, and inexorable hardship, however fabricated or embellished, has helped the island reinvent its economy as one heavily reliant on the outside—particularly on a tourist industry that brings in as many as 2,000 visitors a day by ferry—rather than self-sufficient. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 shows that the perpetuation of the ""myth"" of the Aran Islands as ""isolated and self-sufficient"" and a place of ""remoteness, exposure, and inexorable hardship"" fuels the tourist industry there.  Consequently, if Inishmore were to overcome this image, such a change would not be plausibly connected to Inishmore's prosperous tourist industry.  If the idea of the island as a barren place of hardship disappears, tourists would be less likely to visit the island.
By contrast, the following can be plausibly connected to Inishmore being favored as a place of tourism:
Inishmore has been the most historically intriguing of the islands (Choice A).  Paragraph 2 states that Inishmore was ""certainly the most historically colorful"" of the islands, having survived ""Viking raiders"" and ""Cromwellian soldiers.""  In addition, it ""hosted the first monastic communities of Ireland.""  This historical background would likely attract tourists to the island.
Inishmore has long been considered to be on the edge of civilization (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 1, the island was situated ""on what…must have seemed the very periphery of the civilized world.""  Moreover, its remote and wild nature has constituted ""a myth that has arguably become a commodity (something bought and sold)"" (Paragraph 5), thus attracting tourists.
Inishmore has long been engaged in a dramatic struggle against nature (Choice C).  Paragraph 4 discusses the documentary film Man of Aran as dramatizing (ie, representing for an audience and in a way that likely exaggerates or distorts) ""the islanders' daily existence as a never-ending and desperate struggle against the elements, particularly the constant apocalyptic (catastrophic) threat of the sea.""  This supposed long-standing and dramatic struggle with the sea is part of the ""image"" or ""myth"" (Paragraph 5) of the Aran Islands that attracts tourists."
"415","Based on the passage, the author implies that the inhabitants of Inishmore believed that the sea:","C","73","For example, the abundance of seaweed off its shores supplied a remedy for the scarcity of soil.  Once most of the boulders were cleared away, the sand could be layered with the seaweed, which, as it rotted, transformed the granular matter into fertile earth in which common crops such as barley, rye, oats, and potatoes have since been cultivated.  More land also meant more livestock could be raised, and the grass-fed calves of the island are still prized by mainlanders.  Seaweed could also be harvested by the ton and burnt in kilns to produce kelp, the sale of which on the mainland continues to be a thriving, if seasonal, industry, often more reliable than fishing. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 states that ""the abundance of seaweed off [Inishmore's] shores supplied a remedy for the scarcity of soil"": it ""could be layered"" into the sand so that when ""it rotted, [it] transformed the granular matter into fertile earth.""  On this newly created land, ""common crops…have since been cultivated…[and] livestock could be raised.""  Moreover, the sea supported kelp-making, ""a thriving, if seasonal, industry, often more reliable than fishing.""  Furthermore, the island's commerce or trade with the mainland must have depended on sea travel.  Therefore, based on the passage, the author implies that the inhabitants of Inishmore believed the sea was essential for their economic stability.
(Choice A)  As Paragraph 3 shows, although the rocky, barren island naturally lacked ""arable (suitable for growing crops) land,"" more land could be created by layering sand ""with seaweed.""  The crops and livestock on land were therefore ultimately dependent on the sea.  According to the passage, then, the author does not imply that the inhabitants of Inishmore believed that the sea was as important as their land, but rather that it was more important.
(Choice B)  Although Paragraph 3 suggests that fishing was not the most reliable industry, the sea offered other industries, such as the production of kelp, ""the sale of which on the mainland continues to be a thriving, if seasonal, industry, often more reliable than fishing.""  Therefore, based on the passage, the author does not imply that the inhabitants of Inishmore believed that the sea was too unpredictable to be their chief financial resource.
(Choice D)  The Man of Aran documentary, mentioned in Paragraph 4, depicted the sea as a ""constant apocalyptic (catastrophic) threat"" to the inhabitants of Inishmore, implying that any labor carried out on the water or the shore, such as fishing, could have been perilous (dangerous) or, at least, risky.  However, Paragraph 4 stresses that the film had ""dramatized (ie, represented for an audience and in a way that likely exaggerated or distorted) the islanders' daily existence as a never-ending and desperate struggle against the elements,"" especially the sea, and that ""life on Inishmore even in the 1800s was a far cry from that depicted in...Flaherty's self-styled documentary…of 1934.""  Therefore, the author does not imply that the inhabitants of Inishmore believed that the sea was generally correlated with peril."
"416","Which of the following situations in the tourist business is most analogous to the one described in Paragraph 5 regarding the Man of Aran sweater?","D","73","Eighty years later, this image of Aran life endures, perpetuating a myth that has arguably become a commodity as real as the Man of Aran sweater sold on Inishmore but typically knit elsewhere in Ireland—a symbol of the island's dual character, of its commercial nature that so patently contradicts its celebrated identity as isolated and self-sufficient.  Still, the persistence of this image of remoteness, exposure, and inexorable hardship, however fabricated or embellished, has helped the island reinvent its economy as one heavily reliant on the outside—particularly on a tourist industry that brings in as many as 2,000 visitors a day by ferry—rather than self-sufficient. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 explains that the Man of Aran sweater, ""sold on Inishmore but typically knit elsewhere in Ireland,"" is marketed to tourists as an authentic product of the island.  Similarly, the box of chocolates the Canadian tourist buys in France, although being marketed as Swiss chocolate, was actually made in Belgium and, so, is not authentically Swiss.  Even though the chocolates are being purchased in a third country (France), this situation in the tourist business is the most analogous (equivalent) to the situation of the Man of Aran sweater described in the passage.
By contrast, the following situations are not analogous to the situation of the Man of Aran sweater:
An Italian tourist orders pizza while visiting a historic village in Japan (Choice A).  The Man of Aran sweater sold on Inishmore is a traditional item that is not made locally.  By contrast, the pizza served in Japan is a nontraditional food made locally.  Furthermore, unlike the sweater, the pizza is not being marketed as authentic to the Japanese village (or even to Italy).
A Brazilian tourist buys a business suit that was made in China during a trip to London (Choice B).  Although the suit was made in a different country (China), it is not being marketed as authentic to London (England) or elsewhere.
An American tourist buys a turkey in Mexico to celebrate Thanksgiving dinner (Choice C).  The tourist who buys a turkey in Mexico to celebrate Thanksgiving (an American holiday) is not buying something strongly or uniquely associated with a foreign country.  Although the turkey may have been raised locally, it is a traditional food associated with the purchaser's home country."
"417","Based on the passage, it can most reasonably be inferred that Wagner's greatest impact as a composer was due to his:","D","74","However, the most influential Wagnerian innovation was the evolution and systematic application of what would later be known as the leitmotif, a recurring musical phrase or melody closely associated with a particular character, place, or object in the drama….  [Leitmotifs] could, as Hans von Wolzogen explains, be ""developed, interwoven, assimilated with each other, and multifariously transformed.""  Wagner also strategically employed them as ""motifs of memory"" that reminded the audience of previous scenes in the drama.  Thus, leitmotifs not only served as dramatic devices to signal the appearance of different characters but provided the internal musical logic and unifying mechanism for the entire operatic cycle.  Through liberal use of leitmotifs, Wagner was able to generate something Michael Halliwell describes as ""a dense, constantly evolving, and fully enclosed dramatic world"" whose musical complexity was staggering. (Paragraph 3)
Yet his accomplishments in opera surpassed that of any other composer, including his Italian counterpart Giuseppe Verdi.  In fact, few areas of European and world culture have escaped Wagner's influence….  Nevertheless, moviegoers today would struggle to identify Wagner's innovative use of the leitmotif as the progenitor of musical film scores and, particularly, of the popular phenomenon of the ""theme song."" (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 3, ""the most influential Wagnerian innovation was the evolution and systematic application of…the leitmotif, a recurring musical phrase or melody closely associated with a particular character, place, or object in the drama.""  For the innovative composer, leitmotifs provided creative possibilities for shaping the operatic score because, as Von Wolzogen states, ""they could…be 'developed, interwoven, assimilated with each other, and multifariously (variously) transformed.'""  Wagner used leitmotifs as a musical mechanism and ""dramatic device"" that, by reminding the audience of earlier scenes and signaling the appearance of various characters, served to unify the operatic work.  Furthermore, by using leitmotifs strategically, Wagner could develop an opera into what Halliwell called ""'a dense, constantly evolving, and fully enclosed dramatic world,'"" the musical complexity of which was astonishing.
Wagner's complex use of leitmotifs was greatly influential; in fact, ""his accomplishments in opera surpassed that of any other composer.""  Furthermore, in cinema, as Paragraph 5 explains, Wagner's ""innovative use of the leitmotif"" was ""the progenitor (parent) of musical film scores and, particularly, of the popular phenomenon of the 'theme song.'""  Therefore, based on the passage, it can most reasonably be inferred that Wagner's greatest impact as a composer was due to his use of leitmotifs as a complex musical device.
 (Choice A)  elevation of opera by inventing the phenomenon of Gesamtkunstwerk.  According to Paragraph 1, Wagner ""set out to revitalize and revolutionize"" opera by ""adopt[ing] the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk, or 'total work of art.'""  He now viewed ""the ideal form of opera as a synthesis (mixture) of the poetic, visual, musical, and dramatic arts.""  Thus, the composer made sure that ""rather than the opera's drama being subordinate (secondary) to the music, as was typical in [his] time, the music would now be integrated with the drama.""  However, while it is plausible that Wagner's application of the theory of Gesamtkunstwerk served to elevate opera, the passage indicates that composer did not invent the phenomenon but merely ""adopted"" it.
(Choice B)  shaping the musical scores to suit the libretti.  According to Paragraph 1, Wagner diverged from most composers of his day in ensuring that ""rather than the opera's drama being subordinate to the music, as was typical in [his] time, the music would now be integrated with the drama.""  Thus, Wagner's practice of shaping his music to fit the dramas or libretti (lyrics and narratives) influenced opera.  However, as Paragraph 3 emphasizes, ""the most influential Wagnerian innovation was the evolution and systematic application of…the leitmotif""; this innovation influenced not only opera, but also ""the not-yet-invented art of cinema"" (Paragraph 5).
(Choice C)  efforts to preserve opera's distinction from other genres.  Having adopted ""the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk, or 'total work of art,'"" Wagner came to view ""the ideal form of opera as a synthesis of the poetic, visual, musical, and dramatic arts.""  Accordingly, ""the music would now be integrated with the drama"" (Paragraph 1).  Therefore, the passage indicates that Wagner sought to combine traditional opera music with other art forms (such as poetry and drama); he did not try to maintain opera as a separate artistic endeavor, nor did he make efforts to preserve opera's distinction from these other genres."
"418","Based on the information in Paragraph 3, which of the following conclusions could most reasonably be drawn?","A","74","However, the most influential Wagnerian innovation was the evolution and systematic application of what would later be known as the leitmotif, a recurring musical phrase or melody closely associated with a particular character, place, or object in the drama.…  They could, as Hans von Wolzogen explains, be ""developed, interwoven, assimilated with each other, and multifariously transformed.""  Wagner also strategically employed them as ""motifs of memory"" that reminded the audience of previous scenes in the drama.  Thus, leitmotifs not only served as dramatic devices to signal the appearance of different characters but provided the internal musical logic and unifying mechanism for the entire operatic cycle.  Through liberal use of leitmotifs, Wagner was able to generate something Michael Halliwell describes as ""a dense, constantly evolving, and fully enclosed dramatic world"" whose musical complexity was staggering. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, Wagner was innovative in using the leitmotif, or ""recurring musical phrase or melody closely associated with a particular character, place, or object.""  Leitmotifs had creative potential because they were versatile; they could, as Von Wolzogen describes, ""'be developed, interwoven, assimilated with each other, and multifariously (variously) transformed.'""  In other words, they could be overlapped.  In Wagnerian opera, leitmotifs constituted not only a ""dramatic device"" but supplied ""the internal musical logic and unifying mechanism"" for the whole, suggesting the composer overlapped them.
Furthermore, according to Halliwell, Wagner was able to use leitmotifs to produce ""'a dense, constantly evolving, and fully enclosed dramatic world,'"" which implies a complex network of overlapping leitmotifs.  Consequently, based on the information in Paragraph 3, it can most reasonably be concluded that various leitmotifs overlapped with each other in Wagnerian opera.
 (Choices B and C)  A single leitmotif represented different entities; and Some leitmotifs were played only once.  Paragraph 3 defines the concept of the leitmotif as ""a recurring musical phrase or melody closely associated with a particular character, place, or object in the drama.""  Accordingly, to qualify as a leitmotif, a musical phrase must be played more than once and can represent only one entity.
(Choice D)  Only a few leitmotifs occurred frequently in a single work.  As a ""musical phrase or melody closely associated with a particular character, place, or object in the drama"" (Paragraph 3), a leitmotif would be repeated throughout a musical score.  However, although Wagner was known for his liberal and systematic use of leitmotifs, Paragraph 2 never discusses the number of leitmotifs that appear or their frequency."
"419","Which of the following is an assumption made by the author in Paragraph 1?","B","74","Judging the opera of his day to be in a desperate state of decline, the 19th-century German composer Wilhelm Richard Wagner—arguably the most controversial, if not the most titanic, figure in the history of classical music—set out to revitalize and revolutionize the genre.  In his 1851 book-length essay, Opera and Drama, Wagner adopted the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk, or ""total work of art,"" leading him to envision the ideal form of opera as a synthesis of the poetic, visual, musical, and dramatic arts.  Thus, rather than the opera's drama being subordinate to the music, as was typical in Wagner's time, the music would now be integrated with the drama. (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 describes how ""the 19th-century German composer Wilhelm Richard Wagner…set out to revitalize and revolutionize"" the musical genre of opera.  Having adopted the notion of Gesamtkunstwerk, or ""total work of art,"" he came to view the ""ideal form of opera as a synthesis of the poetic, visual, musical, and dramatic arts.""  His application of the principles of Gesamtkunstwerk to opera meant that ""rather than the opera's drama being subordinate (secondary) to the music, as was typical in Wagner's time, the music would now be integrated with the drama.""
Therefore, before Wagner's innovations in the 19th century, the dramatic aspects of opera would have been subordinate to the music.  Accordingly, the author makes the assumption that prior to the 19th century, opera composers emphasized the musical score over the drama in their works.
 (Choice A)  The most innovative composers in the history of music tended to be controversial.  Paragraph 1 describes Wagner as ""arguably the most controversial, if not the most titanic (larger than life), figure in the history of classical music"" whose goal was ""to revitalize and revolutionize"" opera.  Thus, Wagner was not only innovative as a composer but tended to attract attention to himself.  However, Paragraph 1 never indicates whether in the history of music other composers had not been both innovative and controversial.
(Choice C)  Wagner was the most esteemed composer of the 19th century.  The passage portrays Wagner as being an innovative opera composer and refers to his Ring cycle as a ""masterpiece"" (Paragraph 4).  Paragraph 5 states that ""[Wagner's] accomplishments in opera surpassed that of any other composer, including his Italian counterpart Giuseppe Verdi.""  However, while the author retrospectively describes Wagner as surpassing other composers' accomplishments, he or she never claims that Wagner was the most esteemed composer during the 19th century.
(Choice D)  Few European operas produced in the 19th century were popular.  According to Paragraph 1, Wagner saw ""the opera of his day"" as being ""in a desperate state of decline"" and, accordingly, ""set out to revitalize and revolutionize the genre.""  However, Paragraph 1 never indicates whether the public shared Wagner's negative view of the opera of his day, nor discusses the popularity of 19th-century European operas."
"420","Which of the following claims about 19th-century composers is implied by passage information?","C","74","In contrast to the practices of his predecessors and contemporaries, like Carl Maria von Weber and Giacomo Meyerbeer, Wagner blurred the lines between the traditional operatic components of recitative (musical dialogue) and aria (solo) and virtually eliminated large choral segments. (Paragraph 2)
In Paragraph 2, the author compares Wagner's methods of composition to those of his peers: ""In contrast to the practices of his predecessors and contemporaries…Wagner blurred the lines between the traditional operatic components of recitative (musical dialogue) and aria (solo) and virtually eliminated large choral segments.""  Thus, the passage suggests that Wagner was an innovator who dared to overturn traditional practices, unlike most 19th-century opera composers who followed long-standing operatic conventions.  Accordingly, passage information implies that most 19th-century opera composers were more concerned with convention than risk-taking.
 (Choice A)  Most made an impact beyond the European world of opera.  According to Paragraph 5, ""[F]ew areas of European and world culture have escaped Wagner's influence.""  For example, the composer had a lasting impact on the art of film: ""[H]is Ring cycle combined story with visual elements and dramatic music to anticipate the not-yet-invented art of cinema.""  However, the passage never indicates whether there were other 19th-century composers whose impact had extended beyond the European world of opera.
(Choice B)  Most chose to write the lyrics to their own operas.  Paragraph 4 conveys that ""[u]nlike most opera composers, Wagner wrote not only the musical scores to his works, but also the libretti (the lyrics and narrative).""  Hence, the passage indicates that Wagner diverged from the practices of his musical predecessors and contemporaries in choosing to write his own lyrics or libretti.  Therefore, the passage does not imply that most 19th-century opera composers chose to write the lyrics to their own operas.
(Choice D)  Most created operas based on stories from mythology.  According to Paragraph 4, Wagner's Ring cycle libretti ""were based on the medieval epics of Norse and Germanic mythology.""  However, the passage never mentions whether other 19th-century opera composers produced operas based on stories from mythology."
"421","According to the passage, people who hear leitmotifs in movies would be likely to experience:","B","74","[Leitmotifs] could, as Hans von Wolzogen explains, be ""developed, interwoven, assimilated with each other, and multifariously transformed.""  Wagner also strategically employed them as ""motifs of memory"" that reminded the audience of previous scenes in the drama.  Thus, leitmotifs not only served as dramatic devices to signal the appearance of different characters but provided the internal musical logic and unifying mechanism for the entire operatic cycle.  Through liberal use of leitmotifs, Wagner was able to generate something Michael Halliwell describes as ""a dense, constantly evolving, and fully enclosed dramatic world"" whose musical complexity was staggering. (Paragraph 3)
Most notably, his Ring cycle combined story with visual elements and dramatic music to anticipate the not-yet-invented art of cinema.  Indeed, early film score composers were schooled in Wagnerian techniques; they understood the versatile and subtle power of the leitmotif to unify all aspects of the drama and influence the audience emotionally. (Paragraph 5)
In Paragraph 3, the author discusses Wagner's use of the leitmotifs (repeating musical phrases linked to individual elements or characters of the drama) as a crucial means of unifying or interconnecting the different elements of a dramatic work.  For example, Wagner would employ them as ""'motifs of memory,'"" which ""reminded the audience of previous scenes in the drama.""  In this way, leitmotifs ""provided the internal musical logic and unifying mechanism"" for Wagner's operatic works.  Furthermore, according to Halliwell, the unifying power of the leitmotif enabled the composer to create ""'a dense…and fully enclosed dramatic world.'""
The interconnecting potential of the leitmotif as developed by Wagner was later applied to the art of filmmaking.  As Paragraph 5 conveys, ""early film score composers…understood the versatile and subtle power of the leitmotif to unify all aspects of the drama and influence the audience emotionally.""  Therefore, based on the passage, people who hear leitmotifs in movies would be likely to experience an emotional response to interconnected dramatic elements.
 (Choice A)  feelings of satisfaction at being able to identify characters.  Paragraph 3 describes leitmotifs as ""closely associated with a particular character""; this association allows them to serve ""as dramatic devices"" that signal the appearance of different characters.  Paragraph 5 later indicates that the use of leitmotifs in film has the power to ""influence the audience emotionally.""  However, the passage never claims that this emotional influence on the audience engenders feelings of satisfaction from the ability to identify characters.
(Choice C)  a bias against musical scores that feature theme songs.  According to Paragraph 5, a prominent aspect of Wagner's influence on musical film scores was the transformation of the leitmotif into ""the popular phenomenon of the 'theme song.'""  By referring to the movie theme song as ""the popular phenomenon,"" the passage implies that cinematic audiences would be familiar with theme songs and would likely react favorably to such songs rather than being biased against them.
(Choice D)  an appreciation of Wagner's influence on film music.  In Paragraph 5, the author states that ""moviegoers today would struggle to identify Wagner's innovative use of the leitmotif as the progenitor of musical film scores and, particularly, of the popular phenomenon of the 'theme song.'""  Accordingly, the passage assumes that most filmgoers would be unaware of any Wagnerian influence on cinematic scores.  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that a common audience reaction to hearing leitmotifs in movies would include an appreciation for Wagner's influence on film."
"422","If the passage description of the Panamanian revolution against Colombia (Paragraph 5) is accurate, which of the following would NOT be a reasonable assumption?","A","75","The first to attempt such a feat were the French, under the leadership of Ferdinand de Lesseps.  Having formerly engineered the Suez Canal connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas, Lesseps was a natural choice to head what was presumed to be a similar endeavor.  With the enthusiastic support of his country and the permission of the Colombian government (which controlled Panama at that time), Lesseps and his team began work in 1880, 11 years after the Suez Canal had been completed. (Paragraph 3)
With the failure of the French, the stage was set for the United States to try its hand….  Shortly thereafter, Panamanian dissident Manuel Amador led a rebellion against the Colombian government, while a U.S. warship happened to be sailing off the coast.  Victory was swift; as writer Janet Pascal notes: ""The entire revolution lasted only a few hours.  Only one shopkeeper and a donkey were killed.""  Afterward, newly independent Panama granted construction rights and control of the future canal to the United States. (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 3, the first country that attempted to build a canal in Panama was France, which had ""the permission of the Colombian government (which controlled Panama at that time).""  However, Paragraph 5 relates that the French failed in this endeavor, and that ""[s]hortly thereafter, Panamanian dissident Manuel Amador led a rebellion against the Colombian government.""  This revolution was successful, and afterward ""newly independent Panama granted construction rights and control of the future canal to the United States.""
Since the Panamanians allowed the United States to come into their country to build a canal, they must not have objected to a foreign nation building in Panama.  Therefore, if the passage description of the Panamanian revolution against Colombia is accurate, it would not be reasonable to assume that the Panamanians resented Colombia for allowing a foreign nation to build in their country.
 By contrast, all of the following would be reasonable assumptions:
Colombian forces posed little resistance to Amador's revolution (Choice B).  In describing Panama's rebellion against Colombia, Paragraph 5 relates that ""[v]ictory was swift….  'The entire revolution lasted only a few hours.  Only one shopkeeper and a donkey were killed.'""  Accordingly, based on the quickness and ease with which the revolution was carried out, it clearly did not face much resistance from Colombian forces.
The Colombian government recognized the potential for United States military intervention (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 5, ""Manuel Amador led a rebellion against the Colombian government, while a U.S. warship happened to be sailing off the coast.""  The presence of a U.S. warship at the exact time the rebellion was taking place could easily have been interpreted as a sign of American support for the rebellion.  Thus, especially given the ease of victory for the revolutionaries, the Colombian government seems to have recognized the potential for United States military intervention.
The United States favored Panamanian independence from Colombia (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 5, the United States benefited from the Panamanian revolution.  When considering a site for the canal, a ""drawback to choosing Panama was that the Colombian government would not agree to let the U.S. control the canal once it was built.""  However, after the revolution, ""newly independent Panama granted construction rights and control of the future canal to the United States.""  Since the United States obtained exactly what it wanted from Panama's new government, it can reasonably be assumed that the U.S. favored Panamanian independence from Colombia."
"423","Passage information suggests that France's attempt to build the canal might have succeeded if:","A","75","The first to attempt such a feat were the French, under the leadership of Ferdinand de Lesseps.

(Paragraph 3)
However, the mountainous jungles and swamps of Panama proved a pernicious contrast to the flat sands of Egypt.  Equipment toppled down hillsides or was swallowed into the mud, while frequent rains washed excavated dirt mounds back into the pits from which they had been extracted.  More devastating was the human toll.  Living conditions were squalid and miserable, as workers were ravaged by rampant yellow fever and malaria.  Over twenty thousand lives were lost, with no end in sight to the scourge of disease or to the faltering project.  Ultimately, the construction company went bankrupt, some of its members were imprisoned, and the elderly Lesseps died. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 3, the French sought to build a canal in Panama ""under the leadership of Ferdinand de Lesseps.  Having formerly engineered the Suez Canal connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas, Lesseps was a natural choice to head what was presumed to be a similar endeavor.""  Thus, the French believed they would succeed at building a canal in Panama because of their previous success at building one in another part of the world.
Unfortunately, the situation in Panama was quite different from that of the previous project.  As Paragraph 4 relates: ""the mountainous jungles and swamps of Panama proved a pernicious contrast to the flat sands of Egypt.  Equipment toppled down hillsides or was swallowed into the mud, while frequent rains washed excavated dirt mounds back into the pits from which they had been extracted.""  Furthermore, the French suffered devastating human casualties as ""workers were ravaged by rampant yellow fever and malaria.  Over twenty thousand lives were lost, with no end in sight to the scourge of disease or to the faltering project.""
Therefore, because the French did not account for differences between the environments of Egypt and Panama, they experienced catastrophic losses to both their equipment and their workforce, dooming their attempt to build the canal.  Hence, that disastrous outcome might have been avoided if the French had taken account of those differences.  In other words, their attempt to build the canal might have succeeded if they had more thoroughly studied Panama's environment.
 By contrast, passage information does not suggest that France might have succeeded if:
They had provided their workers with better equipment (Choice B).  One of the many problems that the French faced while building in Panama was that ""[e]quipment toppled down hillsides or was swallowed into the mud"" (Paragraph 4).  However, the passage attributes this misfortune to the difficulty of building in ""the mountainous jungles and swamps of Panama,"" not to any defect in the equipment itself.
Ferdinand de Lesseps had been less elderly (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 4, after the French failed to build the canal in Panama, ""the construction company went bankrupt, some of its members were imprisoned, and the elderly Lesseps died.""  However, although the passage mentions that Lesseps was elderly, it never associates the failure of the project with his age.
Ferdinand de Lesseps had been more experienced in canal building (Choice D).  The passage states that Lesseps was ""a natural choice"" to lead the Panama Canal project because he had ""formerly engineered the Suez Canal connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas"" (Paragraph 3).  Therefore, the problem was not that Lesseps lacked experience in canal building.  Rather, he had not accounted for the differences between the environments of Egypt and Panama, which ""proved a pernicious contrast"" (Paragraph 4)."
"424","Which of the following claims, if true, would most challenge the passage idea that after taking account of its greater width but more hospitable terrain, Nicaragua was a better site for a canal than Panama (Paragraph 5)?","B","75","With the failure of the French, the stage was set for the United States to try its hand.  Some American engineers recommended that the canal should be built through Nicaragua instead of Panama; although the former country was much wider, its terrain was significantly more hospitable. (Paragraph 5)
Traversing the breadth of Panama and incorporating a series of locks to raise and lower ships to different elevations, the Panama Canal finally made it possible to sail from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific without circumnavigating South America. (Paragraph 7)
According to Paragraph 5, some American engineers argued that the canal should be built in Nicaragua because ""although the former country was much wider [than Panama], its terrain was significantly more hospitable.""  Thus, these engineers believed that it would be worth having to build a longer canal because of how much easier the building process would be.
Later, Paragraph 7 describes the Panama Canal as ""incorporating a series of locks to raise and lower ships to different elevations.""  Hence, the canal could not be built as a simple channel across the country; its construction was complicated by the need to include locks to allow elevation changes.
Therefore, if in most regions, land elevation above sea level is higher in Nicaragua than in Panama, there would be added difficulty when building in Nicaragua; construction workers would either have to make more extensive use of such locks, or excavate through mountains.  Accordingly, this added difficulty would challenge the engineers' idea that Nicaragua's terrain was more hospitable than Panama's, and thus that it was a better site for a canal despite its greater width.
 (Choice A)  The Panamanian landscape contains greater natural variation than that of Nicaragua.  Paragraph 4 notes that ""the mountainous jungles and swamps of Panama proved a pernicious contrast to the flat sands of Egypt,"" making the Panama Canal much more difficult to build than the Suez Canal had been.  Therefore, the passage indicates that the varied landscape encountered in Panama was a hindrance to building a canal, unlike the type and consistency of terrain in Egypt.  Accordingly, if the Panamanian landscape contained greater natural variation than that of Nicaragua, this fact would not challenge the idea that Nicaragua was a better site for a canal than Panama.
(Choice C)  A sizeable lake occupies a critical portion of Nicaragua's land mass.  Paragraph 2 indicates that the canal project was meant to create a ""waterway through Central America.""  If a sizeable lake occupied a critical portion of Nicaragua's land mass, then there would already be a waterway through part of that land, which could be incorporated into the man-made sections of the canal.  Therefore, the presence of such a lake would support (not challenge) the idea that Nicaragua was a better site for a canal than Panama.
(Choice D)  The government of Nicaragua insisted on controlling the canal once it was built.  Paragraph 5 conveys that when the United States was considering where to build the canal, a ""drawback to choosing Panama was that the Colombian government would not agree to let the U.S. control the canal once it was built.""  Therefore, if the Nicaraguan government also would not have let the U.S. control the canal, the same drawback would exist whichever of the two countries the canal was built in.  Accordingly, this claim would not challenge the idea that Nicaragua was a better site for a canal than Panama."
"425","The author does NOT provide information about Panama's:","D","75","With the enthusiastic support of his country and the permission of the Colombian government (which controlled Panama at that time), Lesseps and his team began work in 1880, 11 years after the Suez Canal had been completed.

Victory was swift; as writer Janet Pascal notes: ""The entire revolution lasted only a few hours.  Only one shopkeeper and a donkey were killed.""  Afterward, newly independent Panama granted construction rights and control of the future canal to the United States. (Paragraph 5)
The author states that ""the Colombian government…controlled Panama"" in the nineteenth century (Paragraph 3), until ""Panamanian dissident Manuel Amador led a rebellion"" that brought about a ""newly independent Panama"" (Paragraph 5).  However, although such a revolution would have involved violence against the ruling Colombian government, the author provides no information about any Panamanian military, either before or after the revolution occurred.
 By contrast, the author does provide information about Panama's:
size (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 5, ""[s]ome American engineers recommended that the canal should be built through Nicaragua instead of Panama; although the former country was much wider.""  Therefore, the author conveys that Panama is much narrower in size than Nicaragua.
location (Choice B).  Panama is identified as belonging to ""Central America"" (Paragraph 2), with its canal ""finally [making] it possible to sail from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific without circumnavigating South America"" (Paragraph 7).

"426","Which of the following recommendations for a student's English project is most similar to what ""[s]ome American engineers recommended,"" based on the description in Paragraph 5?","B","75","With the failure of the French, the stage was set for the United States to try its hand.  Some American engineers recommended that the canal should be built through Nicaragua instead of Panama; although the former country was much wider, its terrain was significantly more hospitable. (Paragraph 5)
According to the passage, Panama was not the only country considered as a possible site for the canal.  As Paragraph 5 states, ""[s]ome American engineers recommended that the canal should be built through Nicaragua instead of Panama; although the former country was much wider, its terrain was significantly more hospitable.""  Thus, these engineers believed that building in Nicaragua would be worth the tradeoff: even though the canal would have to be longer, the construction itself would be easier.
Therefore, this recommendation is most similar to suggesting that the student should choose the option that allows them to write a longer paper about the less complicated topic.  Like the proposed Nicaraguan canal, the paper would have to be longer, but the writing process would be easier.
 By contrast, none of the following suggestions is like what ""[s]ome American engineers recommended"":
The student should choose the option that allows them to write a shorter paper about the more complicated topic (Choice A).  This suggestion would be similar to building in Panama instead of Nicaragua; the paper would not need to be as long, but the writing itself would be more difficult.
Before choosing a topic, the student should first engage in a background research phase to properly assess both topics (Choice C).  The passage does not describe the engineers as having recommended a research phase before choosing a canal site.  Rather, their assessment that Nicaragua was a better canal site than Panama was the result of research they had already done.
The student should discuss the project with the course professor and get advice on which topic to choose (Choice D).  The passage does not describe the engineers as recommending consultation with another party before deciding on a canal site.  Rather, the engineers themselves were the ones consulted about where and how to build the canal."
"427","Which of the following claims about ethical behavior is assumed in the author's argument?","B","76","In another sense, however, Sarah's actions were not fraudulent at all, because she herself believed in the power of tarot; one can be factually wrong without being morally wrong.  To the extent that Sarah sincerely tried to give her callers what she thought were legitimate psychic readings, she displayed honesty and integrity. (Paragraph 4)
Obviously, there is no such thing as a real psychic, and the predictions are nothing but superstition.  But even a disclaimer like ""for entertainment purposes only"" does not justify a business model that takes advantage of a customer's false belief or misrepresents what it supposedly offers.  Because Sarah honestly tried to give genuine psychic readings, her actions were ethical whereas her employer's actions were unethical. (Paragraph 5)
While discussing the ethics of Sarah's work at the psychic hotline, the author asserts in Paragraph 4 that ""one can be factually wrong without being morally wrong.""  Thus, he or she argues that whether people are ethical depends on their motives rather than their level of knowledge.  For instance, the author points out that even though ""[f]ortune-telling does not work,"" Sarah believed that it did.  Therefore, she ""displayed honesty and integrity"" by trying to give customers what she thought were the real psychic readings they were paying for.
On the other hand, Sarah's employer acted unethically by addressing customers using ""scripts based on corporate assumptions of what callers wanted to hear"" instead of providing ""'genuine' psychic readings"" (Paragraph 3).  According to the author, it does not matter ethically that ""the predictions are nothing but superstition,"" because the hotline still acted dishonestly by ""claim[ing] to sell accurate predictions from 'real psychics' while knowingly providing nothing of the sort"" (Paragraph 5).
Therefore, in contrasting Sarah and her employer, the author treats the intention behind each party's behavior as more ethically relevant than the facts about ""psychic readings.""  Consequently, the author's argument includes the assumption that ethical behavior depends more on a person's intentions than on actual circumstances.
 (Choice A)  It is a matter of being true to oneself instead of following others.  Although Sarah followed her own ideas instead of conforming to those of her company, the author asserts that she behaved ethically because she ""displayed honesty and integrity"" (Paragraph 4) and ""acted in good faith"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, the author's argument does not necessarily assume that ethical behavior is a matter of being true to oneself rather than following others.  Rather, the author argues that the nature of Sarah's behavior is what made her more ethical than her employer.
(Choice C)  It requires a certain amount of intellectual understanding.  The author argues that Sarah acted ethically even though she lacked the understanding that her belief in tarot was ""factually wrong"" (Paragraph 4) and ""nothing but superstition"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, the author does not assume that ethical behavior requires a certain amount of intellectual understanding.
(Choice D)  It varies according to each individual's personal values.  The author states that the ""employer's actions were unethical"" because the business ""takes advantage of a customer's false belief [and] misrepresents what it supposedly offers"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, the author does not assume that ethical behavior varies according to each individual's values; rather, he or she takes the position that the employer acted from unethical values."
"428","The author's assertion that ""in some cases a lie is true"" most likely means that:","A","76","What is a lie?  Most would say that a lie is simply a statement that is false, or that the act of lying is to tell someone something false.  Despite the popularity of that definition, it is not really accurate, as telling someone a falsehood is not in fact the same thing as lying.  Even more strangely, in some cases a lie is true—not in a metaphorical sense, but literally. (Paragraph 1)
Essentially, if someone tries to convince you of something he thinks is false, then he is lying—regardless of whether his statement really is false or, unbeknownst to him, happens to be true.  But if he says something he believes is true but is actually false, then he is not lying.  Thus, what makes a statement a lie is not whether it is false, but whether it is meant to deceive. (Paragraph 2)
One of the author's points in the passage is that a common definition of lying is flawed.  According to Paragraph 1, although most people would say ""the act of lying is to tell someone something false,"" that definition ""is not really accurate.""  The author then makes the further claim that ""in some cases a lie is true—not in a metaphorical sense, but literally.""
Paragraph 2 helps to explain this assertion by distinguishing what a speaker believes from the truth or falsity of his or her claim.  According to the author, ""[I]f someone tries to convince you of something he thinks is false, then he is lying—regardless of whether his statement really is false or, unbeknownst to him, happens to be true.""  In other words, a speaker might incorrectly believe that a statement is false, and try to trick someone else into believing it.  In that case, the speaker is telling a lie, despite the fact that the statement in question is true.  Hence, ""what makes a statement a lie is not whether it is false, but whether it is meant to deceive.""
Therefore, the author defines telling a lie as trying to convince someone of a statement that the speaker believes to be false.  However, he or she points out that such a statement might in fact be true.  Consequently, the phrase ""in some cases a lie is true"" means that a statement may be true even though the speaker believes it to be false.
 (Choice B)  what seems true to one person may seem false to another person.  In Paragraph 2, the author argues that a speaker could believe his statement is false while ""unbeknownst to him, [it] happens to be true.""  Accordingly, the assertion that ""in some cases a lie is true"" refers to a statement that is ""literally"" true (Paragraph 1) as opposed to ""factually wrong"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, although in general it is likely that some statements seem true to one person but false to another, this is not what is meant by the author's assertion.
(Choice C)  a false statement may be compelling enough to fool people.  Although the passage describes scenarios in which people believe statements that are ""actually false"" (Paragraph 2) or ""factually wrong"" (Paragraph 4), it does not discuss how compelling a statement may be or its ability to fool people.
(Choice D)  in some cases a statement is both true and false simultaneously.  The passage describes situations in which people incorrectly believe false statements are true.  For instance, in the author's thought experiment, Mark ""says something he believes is true but is actually false"" (Paragraph 2).  Similarly, Sarah is described as ""saying something that is manifestly untrue"" about tarot readings, even though ""she herself believed in the power of tarot"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, the author conveys that a statement may be false even though someone believes it to be true; he or she never suggests that a statement may be both true and false simultaneously."
"429","Why does the author discuss the thought experiment where a co-worker claims there is a meeting (Paragraph 2)?","D","76","To determine whether Mark was lying, what you need to know is whether he believed there was going to be a meeting.  If he did, then he didn't lie to you; he was just mistaken.  Essentially, if someone tries to convince you of something he thinks is false, then he is lying—regardless of whether his statement really is false or, unbeknownst to him, happens to be true.  But if he says something he believes is true but is actually false, then he is not lying. (Paragraph 2)
A related and unusual example comes from real life.  Sarah was hired by a psychic hotline to tell the fortunes of those who called in. (Paragraph 3)
Fortune-telling does not work….  In another sense, however, Sarah's actions were not fraudulent at all, because she herself believed in the power of tarot; one can be factually wrong without being morally wrong. (Paragraph 4)
Sarah honestly tried to give genuine psychic readings….  Her product may have been fake, but her honesty was real. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 2 describes a thought experiment in which Mark says there is a meeting scheduled.  Although that statement is false, the author notes that Mark was not necessarily lying: ""[W]hat you need to know is whether he believed there was going to be a meeting.  If he did, then he didn't lie to you; he was just mistaken.""  Accordingly, the thought experiment illustrates that just because Mark said something false does not mean that he was dishonest (ie, that he was intentionally trying to deceive someone).
The remainder of the passage applies this distinction to the ""related and unusual example"" (Paragraph 3) of Sarah's psychic predictions.  The author notes that although ""[f]ortune-telling does not work,"" Sarah ""herself believed in the power of tarot"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, even though her claims about predicting the future were false, they were not intended to deceive anyone.  Thus, ""[h]er product may have been fake, but her honesty was real"" (Paragraph 5).
Therefore, the author argues that Sarah's real-life situation is like the scenario in the thought experiment: although she made statements that were false, that does not mean that she was dishonest.  Consequently, the author discusses the thought experiment in Paragraph 2 to provide evidence supporting a distinction between being dishonest and making a false statement.
 (Choice A)  To exemplify the risk that one may place trust in a statement that is later revealed to be false.  The thought experiment describes believing Mark only to later discover that ""his statement was false"" (Paragraph 2).  However, the author never discusses the risk of placing trust in such a statement.
(Choice B)  To illustrate that issues of ethical concern commonly arise even in familiar everyday contexts.  Paragraph 2 describes a scenario in which a co-worker ""tells you that there is a meeting.""  However, although this could be considered a familiar, everyday setting, the author never highlights this feature of the scenario's context.  Rather, he or she simply uses it to introduce a point about truth-telling and honesty.
(Choice C)  To describe the contrast between a lie itself and the act of telling a lie.  In Paragraph 1, the author describes a common view about the definition of a lie: ""Most would say that a lie is simply a statement that is false, or that the act of lying is to tell someone something false.""  Thus, the author presents these claims as two ways of expressing the same idea about lying.  Accordingly, he or she does not describe a contrast between a lie itself and the act of telling a lie."
"430","Suppose that Sarah's employer offered not to fire her if she would agree to use the company's approved scripts.  What would the passage author most likely recommend that Sarah should do?","B","76","Obviously, there is no such thing as a real psychic, and the predictions are nothing but superstition.  But even a disclaimer like ""for entertainment purposes only"" does not justify a business model that takes advantage of a customer's false belief or misrepresents what it supposedly offers.  Because Sarah honestly tried to give genuine psychic readings, her actions were ethical, whereas her employer's actions were unethical. (Paragraph 5)
The passage author criticizes the psychic hotline's business model because it ""takes advantage of a customer's false belief [and] misrepresents what it supposedly offers"" (Paragraph 5).  In addition, he or she asserts that ""[b]ecause Sarah honestly tried to give genuine psychic readings, her actions were ethical whereas her employer's actions were unethical.""  Accordingly, if Sarah accepted the employer's offer to use the company's scripts, the author would view this decision as agreeing to be dishonest and unethical.
Therefore, if Sarah's employer offered not to fire her if she agreed to use the company's scripts, the passage author would most likely recommend that Sarah should refuse the offer and leave the company anyway.
 (Choice A)  Accept the offer for now but start searching for different employment.  Paragraph 5 states that ""[Sarah's] actions were ethical, whereas her employer's actions were unethical.""  Therefore, the author would probably not suggest that Sarah accept the employer's offer for now (even while searching for different employment) because she would then be participating in the company's unethical behavior.
(Choice C)  Agree to the offer but still continue giving traditional tarot readings.  According to the author, Sarah behaved ethically because she ""displayed honesty and integrity"" (Paragraph 4) and ""acted in good faith"" (Paragraph 5).  If Sarah agreed to the company's offer but continued giving traditional tarot readings anyway, this would represent dishonesty and acting in bad faith toward her employer.  Therefore, the author would probably not recommend this course of action.
(Choice D)  Counter-offer to teach the other employees traditional tarot instead.  Although the author states that Sarah's use of tarot exhibited ""honesty and integrity,"" he or she nevertheless views tarot itself as ""inherently fraudulent"" and based on ideas that are ""manifestly untrue"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, even if the other employees were to give traditional tarot readings, the author would still view those employees as participating in a business that ""takes advantage of a customer's false belief"" (Paragraph 5).  Therefore, the passage author would most likely not recommend that Sarah counter-offer to teach the other employees traditional tarot instead."
"431","Based on the passage, a comparison between Sarah's psychic readings and the hotline's psychic readings is most like a comparison between:","C","76","In another sense, however, Sarah's actions were not fraudulent at all, because she herself believed in the power of tarot; one can be factually wrong without being morally wrong.  To the extent that Sarah sincerely tried to give her callers what she thought were legitimate psychic readings, she displayed honesty and integrity. (Paragraph 4)
Certainly, she acted in good faith while her employer clearly did not.  The hotline claimed to sell accurate predictions from ""real psychics"" while knowingly providing nothing of the sort. (Paragraph 5)
The passage states that Sarah was ""factually wrong without being morally wrong,"" because she ""sincerely tried to give callers what she thought were legitimate psychic readings"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, Sarah made an honest mistake about what she was giving the customers.  By contrast, the company ""claimed to sell accurate predictions from 'real psychics' while knowingly providing nothing of the sort"" (Paragraph 5).  Thus, the company was intentionally offering the customers something that it knew was not genuine.
Similarly, someone who confuses a rock for gold is making an honest mistake, whereas someone who paints rocks to pass them off as gold intentionally offers something that is not genuine.  Therefore, a comparison between Sarah's psychic readings and the company's psychic readings is most like a comparison between confusing a rock for gold and painting rocks to pass them off as gold.
 By contrast, none of the following resembles a comparison between Sarah's psychic readings and the hotline's psychic readings:
wondering whether a rumor is true and spreading a rumor regardless of whether it is true (Choice A).  Sarah did not wonder whether her psychic readings were true, but sincerely ""thought [they] were legitimate"" predictions about the future (Paragraph 4).
suspecting a signature is a forgery and forging a signature on a contract (Choice B).  Suspecting that a signature is a forgery means thinking that the signature could be forged, but being unsure.  This is unlike Sarah's view of her psychic readings, which ""she thought were legitimate"" (Paragraph 4).
guessing that a company's value will fall and slandering a company to hurt its value (Choice D).  A guess is a supposition that one is not necessarily sure about.  This is unlike Sarah's view toward her psychic readings, which ""she herself believed in"" (Paragraph 4)."
"432","Suppose that Sarah performed her own tarot reading which predicted she would eventually be fired for not using company scripts.  If Sarah kept giving customers traditional readings anyway, the passage author would probably NOT draw which of the following conclusions?","B","76","Sarah was hired by a psychic hotline to tell the fortunes of those who called in.  When speaking to a customer she would use a tarot deck in the traditional way, then describe the cards' perceived implications for the person's future.  However, her employer did not want the psychics to provide ""genuine"" psychic readings, but instead to address customers using approved scripts based on corporate assumptions of what callers wanted to hear.  Because Sarah was giving the customers ""real"" psychic readings instead of the company's pre-fabricated ones, her employment was terminated. (Paragraph 3)
In another sense, however, Sarah's actions were not fraudulent at all, because she herself believed in the power of tarot; one can be factually wrong without being morally wrong.  To the extent that Sarah sincerely tried to give her callers what she thought were legitimate psychic readings, she displayed honesty and integrity. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 3, when Sarah worked at the psychic hotline, ""her employer did not want the psychics to provide 'genuine' psychic readings, but instead to address customers using approved scripts based on corporate assumptions of what callers wanted to hear.""  Nevertheless, Sarah refused to follow the company scripts and insisted on ""us[ing] a tarot deck in the traditional way"" for her customers.  Because of this behavior, she was ultimately fired.
In the scenario described in the question, Sarah's own tarot reading predicts this firing in advance.  In that case, if Sarah believed in the power of tarot, she would have reason to change her behavior at work in order to avoid being fired.  Accordingly, if she did not change her behavior, one might conclude that she did not really believe in the power of tarot after all.
However, that conclusion would not make sense in light of passage information.  If Sarah did not really believe in the power of traditional tarot readings, then she would have had no reason to perform them against her employer's wishes.  Rather, she could have simply followed the employer's instructions in the first place.  Therefore, the fact that she insisted on giving customers traditional tarot readings suggests that she did believe tarot was real and that she wanted ""to give her callers what she thought were legitimate psychic readings"" (Paragraph 4).
Consequently, in the scenario described, the passage author would probably not conclude that Sarah's actions suggest she did not really believe in the power of traditional tarot readings.
 (Choices A and C)  Sarah's prediction based on her tarot reading only happened to be correct by coincidence; and Sarah could have guessed she would be fired for giving traditional tarot readings anyway.  The author calls fortune telling ""inherently fraudulent,"" and adds that ""[t]hose seeking to purchase knowledge about their future could not—except perhaps by lucky coincidence—receive what they hoped to buy"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, the author would argue that Sarah's successful prediction had nothing to do with the supposed power of tarot, but could easily be based on ordinary reasoning.  For instance, it is highly plausible to suppose an employer might fire an employee who, like Sarah, refused to follow company procedures.  Thus, Sarah could reasonably have guessed she would be fired anyway, regardless of whether her tarot reading coincidentally predicted that this would occur.
(Choice D)  Sarah demonstrated integrity by continuing to give traditional tarot readings.  In Paragraph 4, the author asserts that Sarah acted ethically by continuing to give traditional tarot readings: ""To the extent that Sarah sincerely tried to give her callers what she thought were legitimate psychic readings, she displayed honesty and integrity.""  Accordingly, if Sarah stuck to that decision despite also believing that it would require a personal sacrifice (ie, the loss of her job), this would likely reinforce the author's view that she demonstrated integrity."
"433","In the author's thought experiment, which of the following questions would be most relevant to determining whether Mark lied about the meeting?","A","76","To see why, consider a thought experiment.  Let's say that your co-worker, Mark, tells you that there is a meeting in the conference room at 11:00 AM….  Did your co-worker lie to you?  You already know his statement was false (because there was no meeting), but that knowledge is insufficient.  To determine whether Mark was lying, what you need to know is whether he believed there was going to be a meeting.  If he did, then he didn't lie to you; he was just mistaken.  Essentially, if someone tries to convince you of something he thinks is false, then he is lying—regardless of whether his statement really is false or, unbeknownst to him, happens to be true.  But if he says something he believes is true but is actually false, then he is not lying.  Thus, what makes a statement a lie is not whether it is false, but whether it is meant to deceive. (Paragraph 2)
One of the author's key points is that just because someone says something false does not necessarily mean that the person is lying.  To support this assertion, Paragraph 2 provides a thought experiment in which ""your co-worker, Mark, tells you that there is a meeting in the conference room at 11:00 AM.""  There isn't really a meeting, so Mark's statement was false.  Thus, the question arises: ""Did your co-worker lie to you?""
According to the author, whether Mark lied depends on ""whether he believed there was going to be a meeting.  If he did, then he didn't lie to you; he was just mistaken.""  In other words, there is a crucial difference between making a false statement intentionally and doing so accidentally.  While the former case constitutes lying, the latter case is not a lie but an honest mistake.  Thus, the author asserts that ""what makes a statement a lie is not whether it is false, but whether it is meant to deceive.""  Therefore, knowing whether Mark lied depends on knowing whether his claim about the meeting was meant to deceive you.
In the thought experiment, no one shows up for the meeting besides yourself, which means that Mark was not present either.  If he wasn't in the conference room because he knew all along that there wasn't a meeting, then he intentionally deceived you.  On the other hand, if he wasn't in the conference room because he was running late or was called away, then he only told you something false by mistake.  Consequently, the most relevant question to determining whether Mark lied about the meeting is: Why wasn't Mark in the conference room at 11:00?
 (Choices B and D)  Was there ever really a meeting scheduled for that day and time?; and Why did no other co-workers show up to the meeting?  Although the answers to these questions might reveal whether Mark's statement was false, the passage asserts that ""what makes a statement a lie is not whether it is false, but whether it is meant to deceive"" (Paragraph 2).  However, whether Mark's statement was meant to deceive cannot be determined from these questions.  For instance, suppose that no other co-workers showed up to the meeting because they knew that no meeting had been scheduled for that day and time.  That information would not show whether Mark mistakenly believed that there would be a meeting.  Accordingly, these questions are not the most relevant to determining whether Mark lied.
(Choice C)  What did Mark claim the purpose of the meeting was?  Knowing what Mark claimed the purpose of the meeting was would not indicate whether his statement was ""meant to deceive"" (Paragraph 2).  For example, if Mark honestly believed there was a meeting scheduled, then the meeting's supposed purpose would be part of his mistaken belief.  Similarly, if he knew there was no meeting scheduled, then the meeting's supposed purpose would be part of his deception.  Therefore, answering this question would not help determine whether Mark was lying."
"434","Which of the following best describes Johnston's claim that the Lacanian ego is ""a coagulation of inter- and trans-subjective alien influences,"" based on information in the passage?","D","77","Alienation, lack, absence, and conflict are thus constitutive of the Lacanian ego.  The child's image—and, hence, the emerging ego—marks an ontological gap that turns into a repository for the projections and desires, whether conscious or unconscious, of parents and others.  Consequently, this image, as Adrian Johnston notes, is ""always already overwritten"" with words that are not the child's own.  In Johnston's view, the ego could be more properly described as ""a coagulation of inter- and trans-subjective alien influences.""  Rather than a ""fluid and autonomous subject,"" it becomes a rigid and ""heteronomous"" entity.  Derived from the desires of others, the ego is, in Lacanian terms, ""extimate,"" or internally exterior.  Both alien and alienating, it is an irreducible contradiction. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 details Lacan's theory of how the ego forms during the Mirror Stage: ""The child's image—and, hence, the emerging ego—marks an ontological (pertaining to existence) gap that turns into a repository for the projections and desires, whether conscious or unconscious, of parents and others.""  The author then presents Adrian Johnston's description of the Lacanian ego as ""'always already overwritten' with words that are not the child's own.""  Hence, the Lacanian ego can be understood as ""[d]erived from the desires of others.""  As Johnston goes on to point out, one might even call this ego ""'a coagulation of inter- and trans-subjective alien influences.'""
Thus, in Johnston's interpretation, the ego develops by attracting and retaining not only the conscious—but the unconscious—desires of others.  Accordingly, Johnston's claim that the Lacanian ego is ""a coagulation of inter- and trans-subjective alien influences"" is best described by the statement that the Lacanian ego absorbs the unconscious wishes of others.
 (Choice A)  The Lacanian ego neutralizes conflicting emotional states.  Paragraph 3 explains how during the Mirror Stage the child has conflicting emotions toward his image, which he perceives as more perfect than himself: ""[T]he infant's reaction to the image or Ideal-I is narcissistic; he is attracted to it as a model but feels aggression toward it as a rival.""  Paragraph 4 then asserts that ""[a]lienation, lack, absence, and conflict are…constitutive of the Lacanian ego.""  Johnston's description of the ego as made up of ""'inter- and trans-subjective alien influences'"" and as ""'heteronomous'"" (governed by others) supports this assertion.  Hence, rather than neutralizing conflicting emotional states, the Lacanian ego derives from and maintains such states.
(Choices B and C)  The Lacanian ego is purposely constructed by the adults tending the infant; and The Lacanian ego attempts to defend itself from the desires of others.  According to Paragraph 4, the Lacanian ego forms as a reaction when the child along with tending adults sees his image for the first time.  The image, and consequently, the emerging ego, constitutes a kind of empty space that becomes ""a repository for the projections and desires…of parents and others.""  As Johnston's interpretation of Lacan stresses, due to its receptivity, the emerging ego ""is 'always already overwritten' with words that are not the child's own.""  Since such desires and projections are often unconscious, Johnston's interpretation suggests that the adults tending the infant are not completely aware of their role in constructing the child's ego.  Furthermore, the passage suggests that far from attempting to defend itself from the desires of others, the emerging ego is inherently receptive to such desires."
"435","What does the Lacanian notion of misrecognition suggest about the ego?","A","77","Lacan variously describes the formation and consequent function of the ego as a schismatic event of misrecognition…and a process of dialectical tension.  That process sets up an interchange between identification and alienation, generating confusion between being a subject as opposed to an object, between self and other, between what is ""me"" and ""not me."" (Paragraph 1)
At this phase of development, the child lacks any sense of a unified self.  However, when encouraged by an adult, he is able to recognize his reflection in the glass and, at the same time, comes to understand that the specular image looking back at him is, in fact, not himself.  In other words, the image provides the infant with the first glimpse of himself as an object, as ""other.""  According to Lacan…the child experiences…confusion at being unable to distinguish between what is and what is not himself.  Therefore, such recognition amounts to a form of misrecognition, the French term for which, méconnaissance, implies an essential misunderstanding or lack of knowledge. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 1 discusses Lacan's notion of misrecognition in the context of the Mirror Stage and ego formation: the Lacanian ego emerges from ""a schismatic (fracturing) event of misrecognition…and a process of dialectical (based on opposites) tension.""  Such a process establishes ""an interchange between identification and alienation"" that results in ""confusion…between self and other.'""  Paragraph 2 goes on to emphasize how at this stage ""the child lacks any sense of a unified self.""  In recognizing his own reflection, the infant realizes, paradoxically, that the image ""is, in fact, not himself""; thus, for the first time, he sees himself as ""an object, as 'other.'""
Accordingly, during the Mirror Stage, the child becomes confused, ""unable to distinguish between what is and what is not himself.""  As the passage indicates, in Lacan's framework, ""such recognition amounts to…misrecognition"" or, more precisely, a ""misunderstanding or lack of knowledge"" of the self as other (Paragraph 2).  Therefore, the Lacanian notion of misrecognition suggests that the ego cannot be distinguished from the other.
 (Choice B)  The ego's formation is based on self-knowledge.  The Mirror Stage reveals self-knowledge to be problematic.  According to Paragraph 2, ""[T]he initial fascination and pleasure the child experiences upon self-recognition dissolves into confusion at being unable to distinguish between what is and what is not himself.""  Due to this confusion, Lacan believed ""such recognition amounts to…misrecognition,"" the word for which in French connotes ""an essential misunderstanding or lack of knowledge.""  Accordingly, from a Lacanian perspective, ego formation is based not on self-knowledge but on a lack of self-knowledge.
(Choice C)  The ego can overcome its incoherence.  During the Mirror Stage, the child's sense of self wavers between coherence and incoherence.  Even though ""the child in the mirror appears coherent, coordinated, and whole, the child himself continues to perceive his body as uncoordinated and fragmentary, resulting in a profound sense of incongruity and disharmony.""  Thus, the image in the mirror ""holds up an 'Ideal-I,'"" one that ""is ultimately unattainable, though we will likely spend the rest of our lives in pursuit of it.""  As Paragraph 5 summarizes, ""the ego is intrinsically and irreparably divided.""  Consequently, the Lacanian notion of misrecognition suggests that the ego never becomes whole but instead retains its incoherence.
(Choice D)  The ego's nature is unknowable.  Paragraph 2 describes the child's identity confusion during the Mirror Stage and the consequent effect on the formation of his ego.  According to Lacan, ""[T]he child experiences…confusion at being unable to distinguish between what is and what is not himself.""  Thus, recognition is actually a kind of misrecognition—an experience Lacan designates by the French term méconnaissance, connoting a ""misunderstanding or lack of knowledge.""  The ego's nature is then described in Paragraph 4 as constituted by ""[a]lienation, lack, absence, and conflict"" and as ""a repository for the projections and desires…of…others.""  Accordingly, since the ego's nature can be described in specific—albeit seemingly negative—terms, the Lacanian notion of misrecognition suggests that the ego's nature is, in fact, knowable."
"436","Based on the passage, which of the following experiences during the Mirror Stage would be most likely to facilitate the development of a child's ego?","C","77","At this phase of development, the child lacks any sense of a unified self.  However, when encouraged by an adult, he is able to recognize his reflection in the glass and, at the same time, comes to understand that the specular image looking back at him is, in fact, not himself.  In other words, the image provides the infant with the first glimpse of himself as an object, as ""other."" (Paragraph 2)
The passage outlines Lacan's Mirror Stage in which the infant first encounters his reflection in a mirror in the presence of caregivers, facilitating ego development.  At this stage, ""the child lacks any sense of a unified self.  However, when encouraged by an adult, he is able to recognize his reflection in the glass and, at the same time, comes to understand that the specular (mirror) image looking back at him is, in fact, not himself.""  Accordingly, in Lacan's view, the image ""provides the infant with the first glimpse of himself as an object, as 'other'"" (Paragraph 2).
As in the Mirror Stage where the infant recognizes the mirror reflection of himself in the presence of his caregivers, a child, by watching himself in family videos, would be able to identify images of himself along with family members. In both scenarios, the child is now able to see the image as separate from himself, ""as object, as other.""  Therefore, based on the passage, the experience of watching himself in family videos would most likely facilitate the development of a child's ego during what would be the Mirror Stage.
 (Choice A)  Seeing a portrait of himself.  The Mirror Stage and its effects on the child's ego formation depend on the visual stimulus provided by the child's own image and on the presence of a caregiver.  According to Paragraph 2, during this phase, ""the child lacks any sense of a unified self.  However, when encouraged by an adult, he is able to recognize his reflection in the glass and, at the same time, comes to understand that the specular (mirror) image…is, in fact, not himself.""  By contrast, a portrait, which is static, would not provide the child with the same stimuli and dynamic visual feedback as a mirror in which he could see his own and his caregivers' movements reflected back.  Therefore, the experience of seeing a portrait of himself would be unlikely to facilitate the development of the child's ego.
(Choices B and D)  Encountering new sensory stimuli; and Practicing his motor skills. It is plausible that both new stimuli for the senses and practicing motor skills would have positive effects on a child's ego.  However, the phenomenon of the Mirror Stage centers on the visual stimulus of the mirror image of the child in the presence of caregivers as facilitating ego formation.  Given that scenario as the model, the experience of encountering new sensory stimuli and practicing his motor skills would be unlikely to facilitate the development of the child's ego."
"437","Which of the following inferences about the Mirror Stage can most reasonably be drawn from the information in the passage?","B","77","At this phase of development, the child lacks any sense of a unified self.  However, when encouraged by an adult, he is able to recognize his reflection in the glass and, at the same time, comes to understand that the specular image looking back at him is, in fact, not himself.  In other words, the image provides the infant with the first glimpse of himself as an object, as ""other."" (Paragraph 2)
The child's image—and, hence, the emerging ego—marks an ontological gap that turns into a repository for the projections and desires, whether conscious or unconscious, of parents and others.  Consequently, this image…is ""always already overwritten"" with words that are not the child's own. (Paragraph 4)
Lacan's Mirror Stage describes the child's first encounter with his image in a mirror as an event closely involving caregiver(s).  Since at this stage ""the child lacks any sense of a unified self"" (Paragraph 2), it is only with the encouragement of a caregiver that he ""is able to recognize his reflection in the glass.""  Nevertheless, at the same time, the child realizes that the image he sees is not himself.  As Paragraph 4 explains, this means that ""[t]he child's image—and, hence, the emerging ego—marks an ontological (pertaining to existence) gap.""  Furthermore, this gap becomes ""a repository for the projections and desires, whether conscious or unconscious, of parents and others.""
Thus, the passage shows that the Mirror Stage is mediated by the adults who interact with the infant.  Therefore, one can most reasonably draw the inference that the Mirror Stage is generally facilitated through social interactions rather than unfolding in a purely spontaneous manner.
 By contrast, none of the following inferences regarding the Mirror Stage can reasonably be drawn:
It is likely to cause harm as infants are extremely sensitive to the reactions of others (Choice A).  The passage describes the child's developing ego as extremely sensitive to the reactions of others.  According to Paragraph 4, ""The child's image—and, hence, the emerging ego…turns into a repository for the projections and desires, whether conscious or unconscious, of parents and others.""  Furthermore, as expressed by Adrian Johnston, ""[T]his image…is 'always already overwritten' with words that are not the child's own.""  Therefore, the passage presents the reactions of the child's caregivers as facilitating ego formation at this stage and so unlikely to cause harm.
It is a phase of childhood development that loses impact in adulthood (Choice C).  Paragraph 3 explains the possible long-term consequences of the Mirror Stage: ""[T]he mirror image…holds up an 'Ideal-I' or future self that promises completeness and perfection.""  However, this Ideal-I ""is ultimately unattainable, though we will likely spend the rest of our lives in pursuit of it.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that the Mirror Stage actually continues to affect a person throughout his or her life.
It is limited by the infant's helplessness, particularly his inability to speak (Choice D).  The passage describes the infant as largely helpless and unable to speak during the Mirror Stage.  Moreover, according to Paragraph 2, at this stage, ""the child lacks any sense of a unified self.""  Hence, it is only with the encouragement of an attending adult that the child ""is able to recognize his reflection,"" while realizing that this image is not himself.  Paragraph 4 describes the ego emerging from the Mirror Stage as an empty space for ""the projections and desires…of…others.""  Hence, as Adrian Johnston notes, the ego that emerges ""is 'always already overwritten' with words that are not the child's own.""  Accordingly, this information suggests that the infant's helplessness and inability to speak are essential to the unfolding of the Mirror Stage and its effects."
"438","The passage description of the effects of the Ideal-I on the ego would suggest that:","C","77","Furthermore, while the reflection in the mirror appears coherent, coordinated, and whole, the child himself continues to perceive his body as uncoordinated and fragmentary, resulting in a profound sense of incongruity and disharmony.  By exuding mastery and harmony, the mirror image functions as a gestalt: it holds up an ""Ideal-I"" or future self that promises completeness and perfection—a condition, Lacan believes, that is ultimately unattainable, though we will likely spend the rest of our lives in pursuit of it.  Overall, the infant's reaction to the image or Ideal-I is narcissistic; he is attracted to it as a model but feels aggression toward it as a rival. (Paragraph 3)
The Mirror Stage is presented as a normal phase of psychological development in which the child's ego emerges through the tension that arises between the mirror image and his sense of self.  As Paragraph 3 notes, ""[T]he child himself continues to perceive his body as uncoordinated and fragmentary, resulting in a profound sense of incongruity and disharmony.""  This self-perception is at odds with the image in the mirror, which ""[b]y exuding mastery and harmony…holds up an 'Ideal-I' or future self that promises completeness and perfection.""  As Lacan posits, ""the infant's reaction to the image or Ideal-I is narcissistic; he is attracted to it as a model but feels aggression toward it as a rival.""
Thus, according to Lacan's theory of how the ego develops during the Mirror Stage, it is natural for a child to react narcissistically upon seeing his image or Ideal-I for the first time.  Therefore, the passage description of the effects of the Ideal-I on the child's emerging ego suggests that narcissism is a normal part of the ego's development.
 (Choice A)  The personality is a function of the ego but is unaffected by the Ideal-I.  According to Paragraph 3, the mirror image offers the child a kind of model: ""[I]t holds up an 'Ideal-I' or future self that promises completeness and perfection.""  This Ideal-I ""is ultimately unattainable, though we will likely spend the rest of our lives in pursuit of it.""  Consequently, since people continue to strive for this perfection and feeling of completeness their whole lives, passage information suggests that the Ideal-I affects the personality.
(Choice B)  Without the ego's aggression, the Ideal-I could not exist.  Paragraph 3 indicates that the infant's reaction to the Ideal-I is narcissistic, and, as a result, ""he is attracted to it as a model but feels aggression toward it as a rival.""  Accordingly, the passage indicates that the Ideal-I precedes and, in fact, is responsible for provoking the ego's aggression.  Hence, the Ideal-I does not depend on the ego's aggression for its existence.
(Choice D)  The child's previous sense of self-perfection is disrupted by the Mirror Stage.  Paragraph 3 discusses the paradoxical effect of the Mirror Stage: even as ""the reflection in the mirror appears coherent, coordinated, and whole, the child himself continues to perceive his body as uncoordinated and fragmentary, resulting in a profound sense of incongruity and disharmony.""  Thus, while the child perceives himself as imperfect, the mirror image ""holds up an 'Ideal-I' or future self that promises completeness and perfection.""  Accordingly, the passage never indicates that the child has a previous sense of self-perfection that is disrupted by the Mirror Stage; instead, during the Mirror Stage the child perceives himself as imperfect in comparison to his reflected image."
"439","Based on the passage, James believed his psychological study of religion was worthwhile primarily because it:","B","78","From the start, James conceived of his study as a psychological inquiry, declaring that ""religious feelings and religious impulses must be its subject.""  Consequently, he ""propose[d] to ignore the institutional branch"" of religion, confining himself as far as possible to ""personal religion pure and simple.""  Furthermore, in this unique exploration, James primarily endeavored to prove that personal experience—that is, the inner religious life of the individual—was the scaffolding upon which the outer religious life of the world was built.  In other words, the power of organized religion was derived from direct, personal communications from the divine.  Therefore, rather than analyze the fixed patterns found in theologies or doctrines, James decided to examine the personal experiences from which such patterns had originally been instituted. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 describes James' approach to the study of religion: he envisioned ""a psychological inquiry,"" adding that ""religious feelings and religious impulses"" rather than ""'the institutional branch'"" of religion would be his subject.  As the author indicates, James aimed to show that personal experience was the basis of established religion, describing it as ""the scaffolding upon which the outer religious life of the world was built.""  Accordingly, James chose to examine the personal experiences that inspired religious practices rather than ""the fixed patterns"" found in theologies or doctrines.
Hence, James was determined to complete a study of religion that was psychological in nature and so focused on the original, firsthand (ie, more essential) experiences upon which the official patterns of external religious life were built.  Therefore, James believed his purely psychological study of religious experience was worthwhile primarily because it treated religious feelings as more essential than institutionalized religious sentiments.
 (Choice A)  recognized that the study of religion could be hindered by philosophical theorizing.  Paragraph 1 describes James as a radical empiricist who recognized the limitations of reductive thinking and philosophical theorizing.  Thus, James decided to conduct a ""psychological inquiry"" that used a radically empirical approach to examine ""religious feelings and religious impulses"" in accounts of personal religious experience.  This empirical approach helped him defend ""religious experience against philosophical theorizing.""  However, the recognition that philosophical theorizing could be a hindrance was the motivation for James' psychological study of religion rather than the primary reason his study was worthwhile.
(Choice C)  demonstrated the effectiveness of radical empiricism in analyzing any kind of personal religious experience.  According to Paragraph 2, ""James primarily endeavored to prove that personal experience"" or ""the inner religious life of the individual"" constituted ""the scaffolding upon which the outer religious life of the world was built.""  Thus, ""James decided to examine the personal experiences from which such patterns had originally been instituted.""  As Paragraph 5 indicates, by applying a method emphasizing radical empiricism, James succeeded at rescuing ""religious feelings and impulses from reductive thinking and so defended religious experience against philosophical theorizing.""  Accordingly, the passage suggests that through his study, James demonstrated the effectiveness of radical empiricism in analyzing any kind of personal religious experience.  However, such a demonstration was a consequence of James' study rather than the purpose that made it worthwhile.
(Choice D)  helped distinguish transformative religious institutions from nontransformative ones.  Paragraph 4 indicates that James felt personal religious experiences and direct encounters with the divine, such as mystical states, should be evaluated ""according to their consequences.""  In his view, the most important aspect of these experiences was their ability to be transformative for the individual through ""the beliefs they engendered and how these were manifested in the life of the belief-holder.""  However, the passage never indicates that James thought religious institutions were necessarily transformative for individuals.  In fact, Paragraph 2 underscores that in his study, James ""propose[d] to ignore the institutional branch"" of religion, confining himself…to 'personal religion pure and simple.'"""
"440","The central idea of the passage is that:","D","78","Well known for his radical empiricism, pluralism, and pragmatism, William James fervently defended the primacy of raw experience against the reductive theorizing of philosophy. (Paragraph 1)
…James conceived of his study as a psychological inquiry, declaring that ""religious feelings and religious impulses must be its subject.""  …James primarily endeavored to prove that personal experience—that is, the inner religious life of the individual—was the scaffolding upon which the outer religious life of the world was built….  Therefore, rather than analyze the fixed patterns found in theologies or doctrines, James decided to examine the personal experiences from which such patterns had been originally instituted. (Paragraph 2)
Nevertheless, James…denied there was any such thing as ""the religious sentiment,"" elementary religious emotion, formula, or essence.  Such oversimplifications and summations were to him suspect, if not dangerous.  As historian Jacques Barzun observes, ""this Jamesian resistance to reduction"" caused the radical empiricist to champion personal religious experience. (Paragraph 3)
…James took a pragmatic approach that evaluated such encounters according to their consequences.  …[H]e looked at the beliefs they engendered and how these were manifested in the life of the belief-holder. (Paragraph 4)
The passage examines James' commitment to an empirical as well as pragmatic (practical) approach to religion.  Accordingly, Paragraph 1 portrays James as a radical empiricist defending ""the primacy of raw experience against the reductive theorizing of philosophy.""
Another aspect of James' empirical approach was his related conviction that a study of religion should be psychological in nature, its subject ""religious feelings and religious impulses.""  Thus, rather than analyze established religious patterns, James studied ""the personal experiences from which such patterns had originally been instituted"" (Paragraph 2).  Similarly, in emphasizing individual religious experience, James denied the existence of a single ""'religious sentiment'"" or ""essence"" (Paragraph 3).
The passage also describes James' approach to religion as pragmatic or based on practical outcomes.  He evaluated personal encounters with the divine ""according to their consequences,"" that is, ""the beliefs they engendered and how these were manifested in the life of the belief-holder"" (Paragraph 4).
Thus, the passage stresses James' commitment to an empirical and pragmatic approach to studying religion.  Therefore, the central idea is that James believed there are empirical and pragmatic ways of analyzing experience that should be used to study the religious feelings and beliefs of the individual.
 By contrast, although each of the following represents a related Jamesian belief that is discussed in the passage, none constitutes the central idea:
James believed that the theorizing associated with philosophy can be problematic for a study of religion (Choice A).  In James' view, philosophical theories about religion were problematic because they tended to reduce religious experiences to generalities.  Thus, he rejected the possibility of a specific ""'religious sentiment'"" or ""essence"" as an example of ""oversimplifications"" that were ""suspect, if not dangerous"" (Paragraph 3).  Overall, James' belief that such theorizing was problematic prompted him to decide that empirical and pragmatic ways should be used to study religious feelings and beliefs.
James believed that those who have a direct encounter with the divine have more intense religious lives than those who do not have firsthand experiences (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 2, ""James primarily endeavored to prove that personal experience…was the scaffolding upon which the outer religious life of the world was built"" and that ""the power of organized religion was derived from direct, personal communications from the divine.""  Thus, James plausibly believed that those who experience a direct encounter with the divine have more intense religious lives.  However, the passage never provides James' view on the intensity of such lives or compares them.
James believed that the importance of mystical experiences has been largely overlooked by reductionistic thinkers (Choice C).  Although James viewed mystical experiences as ""the most profoundly transformative of religious experiences,"" he encountered ""detractors, doubters, and reductionists"" who wished to dismiss them (Paragraph 4).  Thus, the passage implies that James believed the importance of mystical experiences has been largely overlooked by reductionists.  Being resistant to reduction, however, James took an empirical and pragmatic approach to analyze mystical and other personal religious experiences."
"441","The passage author most likely mentions that James ""had himself delved into spiritualism"" (Paragraph 3) in order to:","A","78","Nevertheless, James—whose ancestors had been strict Calvinists, whose father had been an eccentric and erratic follower of obscure, utopian sects, and who had himself delved into spiritualism—denied that there was any such thing as ""the religious sentiment,"" no elementary religious emotion, formula, or essence.  Such oversimplifications and summations were to him suspect, if not dangerous. (Paragraph 3)
Paragraph 3 suggests James' religious background influenced his later thinking on religion.  Notably, his ancestors were ""strict Calvinists,"" his ""eccentric"" father had followed ""obscure, utopian (excessively idealistic) sects,"" and James himself is described as having been involved in spiritualism (ie, a system of belief involving attempts to communicate with the dead).  The passage suggests that as a result of this exposure, James denied ""any such thing as 'the religious sentiment,' elementary religious emotion, formula, or essence.""  He dismissed such ideas as ""oversimplifications and summations"" that could be ""dangerous.""
Accordingly, the passage reveals James as having been exposed to a range of religious beliefs, suggesting that such exposure might account for his openness to the variety of religious experiences.  Therefore, the passage author most likely mentions that James ""had himself delved into spiritualism"" in Paragraph 3 in order to help shed light on James' receptivity to diverse religious perspectives.
 (Choices B and C)  provide an example of an unconventional religious movement; and exemplify the wide array of different religious beliefs available at the time.  Paragraph 3 details James' varied religious background: his ancestors are described as ""strict Calvinists"" and his father a ""follower of obscure, utopian sects""; notably, James himself ""delved into spiritualism.""  Hence, the author's mention of spiritualism—a somewhat radical religious trend—provides an example of an unconventional religious movement and helps show the range of religious beliefs available at the time.  However, in the context of James' study of religion, especially his denial of ""the religious sentiment,"" the mention of his experience with spiritualism more likely functions to suggest a basis for his receptivity to a wide variety of religious experiences.
(Choice D)  illustrate James' belief in the importance of trying different types of religions for oneself.  Paragraph 3 details James' religious background, including exposure to Calvinism and ""obscure, utopian sects"" as well as his own exploration into spiritualism.  While the mention of such details might suggest James believed in trying various forms of religions, the passage never provides his views on sampling different religions nor suggests he recommended this to other people."
"442","Suppose a philosopher wanted to analyze an individual's account of his or her religious conversion.  James would likely argue that the most valuable information for this analysis would come from:","C","78","In addition to emphasizing the empirical and pluralistic aspects of religious experience, James took a pragmatic approach that evaluated these encounters according to their consequences.  In particular, he looked at the beliefs they engendered and how these were manifested in the life of the belief-holder.  He determined that the mystical state was the most profoundly transformative of religious experiences.  To the myriad detractors, doubters, and reductionists who would dismiss such states as forms of hysteria or side effects of superstition, he responded that ""the most important way to discern the real from the unreal"" and ""to distinguish pathology from truly divine states"" was not to expose their ""root causes"" but to assess the ""fruits"" they yielded. (Paragraph 4)
In conducting his study of religion, James adopted a pragmatic (practical) as well as an empirical approach.  Accordingly, as Paragraph 4 conveys, he believed that personal religious experiences should be evaluated based on their practical outcomes, that is, ""according to their consequences.""  Thus, James ""looked at the beliefs [such experiences] engendered and how these were manifested in the life of the belief-holder.""  The author further stresses that James was interested in how religious experiences (particularly mystical states) proved ""transformative"" for an individual.  In his view, both the authenticity and the transformative power of such experiences should be judged by ""the 'fruits' they yielded.""
Therefore, if a philosopher wanted to analyze a particular person's account of his or her religious conversion, James would likely argue that the most valuable information for this analysis would come from observing whether the individual's actions reveal a lasting personal transformation.
 By contrast, if a philosopher wanted to analyze a particular person's account of religious conversion, James would be unlikely to argue that the most valuable information for that analysis would come from any of the following:
discerning within the person's experience specific repeatable steps leading to conversion (Choice A).  According to Paragraph 2, ""James primarily endeavored to prove that personal experience…was the scaffolding upon which the outer religious life of the world was built.""  As Paragraph 3 explains, James rejected the notion of any single ""'religious sentiment'"" or ""essence,"" seeing such ""oversimplifications"" as ""suspect"" and even ""dangerous.""  Thus, James' resistance to reductive thinking led him to ""champion personal religious experience"" in its own right, not as a source offering specific steps to conversion that others can repeat.
examining the established religious patterns that such experiences influence (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 2, ""James primarily endeavored to prove that personal experience…was the scaffolding upon which the outer religious life of the world was built.""  Therefore, as the author stresses, ""rather than analyze the fixed patterns found in theologies or doctrines,"" James decided to examine the individual experiences from which these established patterns had been instituted.
identifying within that account apparent universal principles such as kindness, mercy, and love (Choice D).  According to Paragraph 2, James made ""'religious feelings and religious impulses'"" the focus of his study, which he confined to ""'personal religion, pure and simple.'""  As Paragraph 3 reports, he also believed there was no such thing as ""'the religious sentiment.'""  Furthermore, although James experienced how easy it was at times to be ""seduced by the commonalities in the narratives"" he had collected, he nevertheless ""insisted on a plurality of individual realities.""  Hence, James would be more interested in focusing on individual, particular aspects within religious accounts than in identifying any apparent common or universal principles."
"443","In Paragraph 3, the passage author indicates that William James:","C","78","Nevertheless, James…denied that there was any such thing as ""the religious sentiment,"" elementary religious emotion, formula, or essence.  Such oversimplifications and summations were to him suspect, if not dangerous.  As historian Jacques Barzun observes, ""this Jamesian resistance to reduction"" caused the radical empiricist to champion personal religious experience.  However, James did admit that, seduced by the commonalities in the narratives, he was at times tempted to develop a science of religion. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, James ""denied there was any such thing as 'the religious sentiment,' elementary religious emotion, formula, or essence.""  In fact, James was suspicious of ""oversimplifications and summations.""  Due to this ""'resistance to reduction'"" or opposition to theoretical abstraction, he focused on personal religious experience.  However, as the author points out, ""James did admit that, seduced by the commonalities in the narratives, he was at times tempted to develop a science of religion.""  Thus, despite James' commitment to rejecting universal principles in favor of individual experiences, he admitted to sometimes wavering from that stated focus.
Consequently, in Paragraph 3, the passage author indicates that William James could struggle to remain consistent in emphasizing individual religious experiences over broader commonalities.
 (Choice A)  established a scientific framework based on shared characteristics of religious experiences.  According to Paragraph 3, ""James did admit that, seduced by the commonalities in the narratives, he was at times tempted to develop a science of religion.""  However, the passage author indicates that James resisted this temptation toward reductive thinking.  He instead continued to ""champion personal religious experience,"" and he ""insisted on a plurality of individual realities.""  Furthermore, when compiling ""personal testimonies of divine encounters,"" James was intent on ""allowing a plethora (overabundance) of different voices to speak.""  Thus, the passage author indicates that James emphasized the individual nature of religious experiences rather than trying to establish a scientific framework based on shared characteristics among them.
(Choice B)  underestimated the role of rational argument in religious studies.  As Paragraph 3 conveys, ""[I]n The Varieties, [James] carefully compiled personal testimonies of divine encounters, allowing a plethora of different voices to speak on the nature of such experience, rather than marshal (assemble) a sustained argument.""  Accordingly, James relied on people's reported experience rather than rational argument as the basis for his study.  However, the author never evaluates James' position: there is no suggestion in the passage that James underestimated or was mistaken about the role rational arguments could play in religious studies.
(Choice D)  endorsed some of the religious and intellectual movements of his day in The Varieties.  According to Paragraph 3, James' ""ancestors had been strict Calvinists"" and his father a ""follower of obscure, utopian (excessively idealist) sects,"" while James ""had himself delved into spiritualism.""  However, the author never suggests that James endorsed any ideas from these religious movements in his volume on religion.  Furthermore, by conveying that, while ""other thinkers equated the ultimate nature of reality with monism (oneness),"" James himself believed in ""a plurality of individual realities,"" the author reveals James as being open to different views rather than as endorsing any particular movements of his day."
"444","Why does the author most likely begin the passage discussion about the nature of blackmail by first describing the crime of extortion?","B","79","Both blackmail and extortion are crimes of coercion: one party attempts to gain by threatening action that would be injurious to another, unless a specified demand is met (usually for financial payment).  However, with extortion the threatened action itself is also illegal.  For example, suggesting that one will vandalize property unless the owner pays a fee would be extortion, because it is unlawful to damage what belongs to another.  On the other hand, promising to expose a secret unless the subject pays would generally be blackmail, because in most cases there is nothing criminal about sharing factual information.  But in light of this distinction, an interesting question arises: Why is blackmail a crime? (Paragraph 1)
This question is more difficult than it may appear, and legal theorists, philosophers, and even economists have attempted to provide answers.  The ""puzzle"" or ""paradox"" of blackmail is to explain the following: How does offering to choose an otherwise legal option (eg, keeping silent), in exchange for compensation, make that choice a criminal act? (Paragraph 2)
The passage begins by distinguishing blackmail from extortion.  According to Paragraph 1, both ""are crimes of coercion: one party attempts to gain by threatening action that would be injurious to another, unless a specified demand is met.""  However, the two practices differ because with extortion, ""the threatened action itself is also illegal,"" whereas with blackmail this is not the case.  For instance, revealing a secret is generally a legal act, so threatening to do so unless payment is made would be blackmail rather than extortion.
However, the author then notes that this distinction between extortion and blackmail raises a question: ""Why is blackmail a crime?"" (Paragraph 1).  Paragraph 2 goes into more detail, asking: ""How does offering to choose an otherwise legal option (eg, keeping silent), in exchange for compensation, make that choice a criminal act?""  In other words, it is easy to see why extortion is illegal, because the threatened action is illegal.  But it is harder to see why blackmail is illegal, because the threatened action would be legal on its own.  Thus, most of the passage is devoted to addressing this puzzle about blackmail.
Accordingly, the description of extortion is used to introduce the question of why blackmail is illegal, which ""is more difficult than it may appear"" (Paragraph 2).  Therefore, the author most likely begins the passage discussion about the nature of blackmail by first describing the crime of extortion in order to anticipate the suggestion that it may be unclear why blackmail is illegal.
  (Choice A)  To justify the common tendency to use the terms 'blackmail' and 'extortion' interchangeably.  According to Paragraph 1, there is a significant difference between blackmail and extortion.  While both practices involve coercive threats, ""with extortion the threatened action itself is also illegal,"" which is not the case with blackmail.  The passage then conveys that because of this distinction, it may even be unclear why blackmail is considered a crime.  Therefore, the passage implies that the terms 'blackmail' and 'extortion' should not be used interchangeably.
(Choice C)  To demonstrate how one legal definition eventually led to the specification of another distinct crime.  In Paragraph 1, the author provides general definitions for the crimes of extortion and blackmail.  However, he or she never discusses the history of these legal definitions, nor suggests that one definition eventually led to the specification of another distinct crime.
(Choice D)  To suggest that the definition of blackmail illustrates problems with illegality as a concept.  According to the passage, the distinction between blackmail and extortion makes it difficult to answer the question: ""Why is blackmail a crime?"" (Paragraph 1).  Thus, the author portrays this specific question about the illegality of blackmail as puzzling.  However, he or she never suggests that the definition of blackmail illustrates problems with the concept of illegality in general."
"445","What is the author's attitude toward the position ""a few scholars"" hold regarding blackmail's legal status?","B","79","Similarly, a few scholars have argued that blackmail should be legal because it actually benefits its target.  Rather than having a secret revealed against his wishes, the target is afforded the opportunity to choose what to him is a more favorable outcome—merely paying a fee.  Thus, like the retailer above, the blackmailer has increased the options available to the ""victim,"" placing him in a better situation than he would have been otherwise. (Paragraph 4)
However, the most compelling argument relates to the ongoing effects of blackmail.  Law professor Richard Epstein stresses that the ""business model"" of successful blackmail is essentially participation in a kind of fraud—not against the blackmailed party, but against the party from whom information is concealed….  Moreover, the presence or potential of blackmail often incentivizes additional harmful or criminal activity by the perpetrator, the target, or both.  Thus, blackmail's effects are not only acute but systemic and pervasive.  As Epstein remarks, ""Blackmail is made a crime not only because of what it is, but because of what it necessarily leads to."" (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 4 describes the view of ""a few scholars"" who argue that ""blackmail should be legal because it actually benefits its target.""  According to these scholars, blackmail offers the chance to avoid an undesirable outcome by ""merely paying a fee.""  Hence, in these scholars' view, ""the blackmailer has increased the options available to the 'victim,' placing him in a better situation than he would have been otherwise.""
However, Paragraph 6 describes an argument by Richard Epstein that the passage author calls ""the most compelling.""  According to Epstein, successful blackmail ""is essentially participation in a kind of fraud—not against the blackmailed party, but against the party from whom information is concealed.""  Furthermore, blackmail ""often incentivizes additional harmful or criminal activity.""  As such, Epstein states that ""'[b]lackmail is made a crime not only because of what it is, but because of what it necessarily leads to.'""
Therefore, the author believes that ""the most compelling argument"" about blackmail comes from Epstein, who claims blackmail is wrong for reasons that go beyond the effects on its immediate target.  Consequently, the author's attitude toward the position of ""a few scholars"" is opposed, because there are additional grounds upon which blackmail is presented as harmful.
  (Choice A)  Favorable, because blackmail is depicted as no more harmful than normal business negotiations.  According to Paragraph 3, ""[c]ertain types of financial coercion are a normal, expected part of business transactions.""  Paragraph 4 then describes ""a few scholars"" as drawing an analogy between such legitimate threats in business and the kinds of threats made by a blackmailer.  However, the author never endorses this comparison; instead, he or she expresses support for Epstein's view that ""'successful blackmail is essentially participation in a kind of fraud'"" (Paragraph 6).
(Choices C and D)  Undecided, as the author describes both harmful and beneficial aspects to blackmail; and Indifferent, as the author never addresses the claim that victims of blackmail are actually better off.  Although the author does not directly address the claim that blackmail ""actually benefits its target"" (Paragraph 4), he or she does take a position about blackmail's effects and legal status.  In Paragraph 6, the author praises Epstein's view that ""blackmail is essentially participation in a kind of fraud"" and that it ""often incentivizes additional harmful or criminal activity"" (Paragraph 6).  Thus, the author supports Epstein's characterization of blackmail as a harmful activity that should be considered a crime.  Therefore, the author is neither undecided nor indifferent about the view that blackmail should be legal."
"446","Suppose that a politician is vulnerable to being the target of blackmail as it is described in Paragraph 1.  Which of the following cases would most clearly constitute an example of blackmail, based on the author's description?","D","79","Both blackmail and extortion are crimes of coercion: one party attempts to gain by threatening action that would be injurious to another, unless a specified demand is met (usually for financial payment).  However, with extortion the threatened action itself is also illegal.  For example, suggesting that one will vandalize property unless the owner pays a fee would be extortion, because it is unlawful to damage what belongs to another.  On the other hand, promising to expose a secret unless the subject pays would generally be blackmail, because in most cases there is nothing criminal about sharing factual information.  But in light of this distinction, an interesting question arises: Why is blackmail a crime? (Paragraph 1)
Paragraph 1 describes the characteristics of blackmail and distinguishes it from extortion.  Both practices ""are crimes of coercion: one party attempts to gain by threatening action that would be injurious to another, unless a specified demand is met (usually for financial payment).""  In addition, with blackmail (unlike extortion), the threatened action would be legal under normal circumstances.  Accordingly, a typical instance of blackmail would be threatening to reveal sensitive information about a person unless he or she pays money to avoid that outcome.
Therefore, the clearest example of blackmail would be a case where the politician lies about accepting money from lobbyists, and his assistant threatens to go to the press unless the politician gives him a raise.  This scenario meets all the criteria for blackmail described by the author: the assistant attempts to gain financially through coercion, by threatening to reveal information (an otherwise legal act) unless he is given a raise.
 By contrast, none of the following cases meet all the criteria described by the author:
The politician misappropriates funding, and his assistant threatens to file an ethics complaint unless the politician returns the money (Choice A).  In this case, there is no attempt to gain on the part of the person making the threat.  Rather, the assistant's demand is for the rightful ownership of the funds to be restored.
The politician plans to vote against financial help for a community, and a citizen from that community threatens to harass the politician's family unless the politician approves the money instead (Choice B).  Paragraph 1 distinguishes between blackmail and extortion by noting that ""with extortion the threatened action itself is also illegal,"" whereas in cases of blackmail the threatened action would be legal under other circumstances.  Because harassment is itself a crime, this scenario represents a case of extortion rather than blackmail.
The politician amasses large gambling debts, and a relative threatens to tell the politician's wife unless the politician tells her himself (Choice C).  The relative in this case is not seeking to gain personally, but rather to maintain the well-being of the politician's wife.  In addition, unlike a case of blackmail, the relative's threat does not include the possibility of keeping the politician's secret.  Rather, the demand is for the information to be revealed either way."
"447","Which of the following claims about blackmail is most strongly suggested by the information in Paragraph 6?","D","79","However, the most compelling argument relates to the ongoing effects of blackmail.  Law professor Richard Epstein stresses that the ""business model"" of successful blackmail is essentially participation in a kind of fraud—not against the blackmailed party, but against the party from whom information is concealed.  If Charlie's well-being depends on whether he knows particular facts about Bob, then Bob's attempt to conceal that information is injurious to Charlie.  As such, Adam can only blackmail Bob by perpetuating Bob's deceit.  Moreover, the presence or potential of blackmail often incentivizes additional harmful or criminal activity by the perpetrator, the target, or both.  Thus, blackmail's effects are not only acute but systemic and pervasive.  As Epstein remarks, ""Blackmail is made a crime not only because of what it is, but because of what it necessarily leads to."" (Paragraph 6)
In Paragraph 6, the author stresses Richard Epstein's view that cases of blackmail involve ""ongoing effects"" that ""are not only acute but systemic and pervasive (ie, intrinsic and continual).""  For example, in addition to coercing the original target, blackmail functions as ""essentially participation in a kind of fraud…against the party from whom information is concealed.""  Thus, if Adam is blackmailing Bob over information that is hidden from Charlie, then ""Adam can only blackmail Bob by perpetuating Bob's deceit.""
Similarly, the author asserts that acts of blackmail do not exist in a vacuum but frequently lead to further wrongdoing: ""[T]he presence or potential of blackmail often incentivizes additional harmful or criminal activity by the perpetrator, the target, or both.""  Hence, the passage conveys that blackmail is not merely a discrete case of causing harm but part of a larger series of harmful acts.
Therefore, the information in Paragraph 6 strongly suggests that cases of blackmail often involve multiple instances of wrongdoing rather than just one.
  (Choice A)  Most attempts to explain blackmail's illegality are based on considerations of fraud.  Paragraph 6 highlights Richard Epstein's view that ""successful blackmail is essentially participation in a kind of fraud.""  However, the passage does not suggest that this perspective is typical of most attempts to explain blackmail's illegality.  Rather, by stating that Epstein gives ""the most compelling argument,"" the author implies that there are other such attempts which are based on different considerations.  Moreover, Paragraph 5 describes arguments about blackmail's legal status that do not mention fraud.
(Choice B)  The illegality of blackmail has nothing to do with the effects on its actual targets.  According to Paragraph 6, part of the justification for blackmail's illegality is that ""the presence or potential of blackmail often incentivizes additional harmful or criminal activity by the perpetrator, the target, or both.""  Therefore, the passage includes blackmail's effects on its targets in the reasons why ""'[b]lackmail is made a crime.'""
(Choice C)  The wrongness of blackmail cannot be understood in terms of rights.  In Paragraph 6, the author states that Epstein's discussion of fraud represents ""the most compelling argument"" about blackmail.  However, although Epstein's argument does not specifically refer to rights, his position could still be understood in terms of that concept.  For instance, the reason it is wrong to engage in ""fraud…against the party from whom information is concealed"" could be that such fraud violates the rights of that party."
"448","Which of the following assertions is NOT suggested by passage information?","A","79","Both blackmail and extortion are crimes of coercion: one party attempts to gain by threatening action that would be injurious to another, unless a specified demand is met (usually for financial payment).  However, with extortion the threatened action itself is also illegal.  For example, suggesting that one will vandalize property unless the owner pays a fee would be extortion, because it is unlawful to damage what belongs to another.  On the other hand, promising to expose a secret unless the subject pays would generally be blackmail, because in most cases there is nothing criminal about sharing factual information.  But in light of this distinction, an interesting question arises: Why is blackmail a crime? (Paragraph 1)
To this end, a comparison to the corporate world is helpful.  Certain types of financial coercion are a normal, expected part of business transactions; for instance, a retailer might threaten to purchase goods from a different wholesaler unless the current one lowers the price per unit.  This sort of tactic is not only legitimate but, in an overall sense, good for all parties. (Paragraph 3)
The passage describes different types of coercion, beginning with two that are criminal.  According to Paragraph 1, ""[b]oth blackmail and extortion are crimes of coercion: one party attempts to gain by threatening action that would be injurious to another, unless a specified demand is met (usually for financial payment).""  Hence, although there is a difference between blackmail and extortion, the passage states that each of those crimes involves illegal coercion.
In addition to those cases, Paragraph 3 notes that there are legal kinds of coercion as well, such as ones which occur as ""a normal, expected part of business transactions.""  For instance, threatening to buy from a different company unless the price is reduced is ""not only legitimate but, in an overall sense, good for all parties.""
Thus, the passage describes cases of criminal coercion, such as ""promising to expose a secret unless the subject pays"" (Paragraph 1), as well cases of legal coercion, such as ""threaten[ing] to purchase goods from a different wholesaler unless the current one lowers the price per unit"" (Paragraph 3).  Hence, the passage implies that it is known in each case whether the type of coercion involved is legal or criminal.  Accordingly, the passage never suggests that coercion's legal status is unclear.
  By contrast, all of the following assertions are suggested by passage information:
Blackmail is a complex issue (Choice B).  Paragraph 1 raises the question ""Why is blackmail a crime?""  Paragraph 2 adds that this question ""is more difficult than it may appear, and legal theorists, philosophers, and even economists have attempted to provide answers.""  The rest of the passage is then devoted to exploring such potential answers, such as the idea that blackmail ""involves appropriating what belongs to other people"" (Paragraph 5).  Hence, the idea that blackmail is a complex issue is an underlying theme of the passage.
Threats can have positive effects (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 3, some types of threats are a ""normal, expected part of business transactions"" that have generally positive effects.  For example, ""a retailer might threaten to purchase goods from a different wholesaler unless the current one lowers the price per unit.""  The author states that ""[t]his sort of tactic is…good for all parties,"" indicating that the effects of such threats can be beneficial.
Blackmail is like a kind of theft (Choice D).  Paragraph 5 describes the view that ""coercing someone through blackmail is illegitimate because it involves appropriating (taking for oneself) what belongs to other people.""  Likewise, the author conveys that ""[a] variation of this view uses more rights-based language"" regarding whether or not a person ""may reasonably have certain 'claims' to information.""  Accordingly, the passage suggests that blackmail can be equated to illegitimately taking what rightfully belongs to someone else.  In other words, it amounts to engaging in a kind of theft."
"449","Based on the passage, the need to tear down and rebuild the White House in the mid-twentieth century might have been prevented if:","B","80","Robert Klara recounts a history of changes to the White House that gradually compromised its structural integrity….  [T]hey had the dual effect of increasing the load borne by the house while decreasing its ability to bear that burden.  The builders responsible for the many additions performed ""careless and foolish maneuvers that a first-year architecture student would never have made,"" such as installing doorways in load-bearing walls or destroying the keystones of a brick arch. (Paragraph 2)
By the turn of the twentieth century, the structural failings of the White House had become difficult to ignore.  The building was likely beyond saving at that point…. (Paragraph 3)
Ultimately, there was little choice but to tear down and rebuild the White House. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 2 discusses ""a history of changes to the White House that gradually compromised its structural integrity"" and ""had the dual effect of increasing the load borne by the house while decreasing its ability to bear that burden.""  Moreover, the builders responsible for those changes ""performed 'careless and foolish maneuvers that a first-year architecture student would never have made.'""  The passage goes on to state that ""[b]y the turn of the twentieth century…[t]he building was likely beyond saving"" (Paragraph 3).  In the end, ""there was little choice but to tear down and rebuild the White House"" (Paragraph 5).
Accordingly, the passage indicates that the need to tear down and rebuild the White House in the mid-twentieth century resulted from past architectural changes that had been poorly planned and executed.  Therefore, that outcome might have been prevented if those past architectural changes had not been so haphazard.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 3 conveys that ""[b]y the turn of the twentieth century, the structural failings of the White House had become difficult to ignore.  The building was likely beyond saving at that point.""  Paragraph 3 further describes one repair project that ""only delayed the inevitable,"" and another that ""had a disastrous side effect…causing enormous structural strain.""  Consequently, the passage indicates both that repair projects had been initiated earlier in the century, and that such projects likely would not have prevented the need to tear down and rebuild the White House.
(Choice C)  After Margaret Truman left her piano on a weak floor, ""one of the piano's legs crashed through, puncturing the overtaxed wood and sending debris cascading into the room below"" (Paragraph 4).  However, the author describes this incident as part of ""a long string of architectural warnings"" (Paragraph 5), indicating that many other factors contributed to the need to tear down and rebuild the White House.  Consequently, this need would have remained even if Margaret Truman had not left her piano on the weak floor.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 3 states that ""[t]he building was likely beyond saving at that point, and President Roosevelt didn't help matters by allowing architect Charles McKim only four months to make repairs.""  Therefore, although the passage implies that McKim should have been granted more time to make repairs, it also indicates that the White House likely would have needed to be rebuilt regardless."
"450","As the author uses the word, a ""crescendo"" is best described as:","C","80","More dramatic incidents involved daughter Margaret Truman's piano.  Not only did the floor of her sitting room begin to sway up and down while she was playing a duet with a friend, but no steps were taken to move the piano away from the weak floor afterward.  Predictably, White House residents and staff were later horrified when one of the piano's legs crashed through, puncturing the overtaxed wood and sending debris cascading into the room below.  As for Margaret, Klara relates how she called the Steinway company to ask for ""a man who could come over to rescue a piano."" (Paragraph 4)
That event was the crescendo in a long string of architectural warnings.  Ultimately, there was little choice but to tear down and rebuild the White House. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 4 states that the ""need to reconstruct the mansion reached a breaking point during the Harry Truman administration.""  For example, ""[w]alls continued to sink and pull away from ceilings"" and chandeliers ""swung dangerously from movement on the floor above them.""  In addition, ""[m]ore dramatic incidents involved daughter Margaret Truman's piano.  Not only did the floor of her sitting room begin to sway up and down while she was playing a duet with a friend,"" but later ""one of the piano's legs crashed through, puncturing the overtaxed wood and sending debris cascading into the room below.""
The passage describes this crash as ""the crescendo in a long string of architectural warnings"" which evidenced the need ""to tear down and rebuild the White House"" (Paragraph 5).  In other words, the ""crescendo"" was the striking culmination of a series of events leading to a particular outcome.  Therefore, as the author uses the word, a crescendo is best described as a culminating event.
(Choice A)  In describing the events involving Margaret Truman's piano, Paragraph 4 states: ""Predictably, White House residents and staff were later horrified when one of the piano's legs crashed through, puncturing the overtaxed wood and sending debris cascading into the room below.""  Accordingly, the author portrays the ""crescendo"" (Paragraph 5) as a calamity that could have been foreseen.
(Choice B)  Although ""crescendo"" is a musical term, the author uses it to describe an event when ""one of the piano's legs crashed through [the floor]"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, the ""crescendo in a long string of architectural warnings"" (Paragraph 5) does not refer literally to a musical climax; rather, the author is making a play on words.
(Choice D)  According to Paragraph 4, ""[t]he need to reconstruct the mansion reached a breaking point during the Harry Truman administration,"" implying that the architectural incidents of that time were the final steps that led to tearing down and rebuilding the White House.  Consequently, Margaret Truman's piano ""puncturing the overtaxed wood and sending debris cascading into the room below"" (Paragraph 4) occurred at the end of a ""long string of architectural warnings"" (Paragraph 5), rather than at a midpoint."
"451","The author most likely mentions the story about Calvin Coolidge (Paragraph 3) in order to:","D","80","By the time of the 1948–1952 renovation, however, there were plenty of people to blame for the White House's condition.  A combination of poor planning, carelessness, and neglect throughout the intervening years caused a catastrophic deterioration. (Paragraph 1)
In 1925, Calvin Coolidge scoffed at reports that the White House roof was unsafe until ""[a] chunk of it broke off and bonked President Coolidge in the head.""  Poetic justice notwithstanding, the repairs to which he only then begrudgingly agreed had a disastrous side effect: the weight of the roof was shifted away from the stronger outer walls to the weaker inner ones, causing enormous structural strain. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 1, ""there were plenty of people to blame"" for the deterioration of the White House, which occurred over time due to ""poor planning, carelessness, and neglect.""  Paragraph 3 suggests that one such blameworthy person was Calvin Coolidge, who ""scoffed at reports that the White House roof was unsafe until '[a] chunk of it broke off and bonked President Coolidge in the head.'""  Even then, Coolidge only ""begrudgingly agreed"" to proposed repairs, illustrating his reluctance to take the issue seriously.  Therefore, the author most likely mentions the story about Calvin Coolidge to exemplify the neglect shown toward the White House by its occupants.
By contrast, the author does not mention the story about Calvin Coolidge in order to:
reveal the full extent of the White House's structural damage (Choice A).  Although the story reveals part of the structural damage to the White House (ie, damage to the roof), further damage is described more extensively elsewhere.  For instance, ""[w]alls continued to sink and pull away from ceilings"" and ""the entire East Room required scaffolding to prevent the collapse of its ceiling"" (Paragraph 4).
illustrate the inadequacy of Charles McKim's past repairs to the White House (Choice B).  Paragraph 3 states that ""President Roosevelt didn't help matters by allowing architect Charles McKim only four months to make repairs.  McKim reinforced the second floor as well as he could within the time allotted, but his efforts only delayed the inevitable.""  Therefore, the author is not highlighting the inadequacy of McKim's past repairs, but rather the neglect shown by White House occupants like Roosevelt and Coolidge.
illustrate the work required to repair the White House roof (Choice C).  Paragraph 3 states that ""Calvin Coolidge scoffed at reports that the White House roof was unsafe until '[a] chunk of it broke off and bonked President Coolidge in the head.'""  However, the passage merely mentions ""the repairs to which he only then begrudgingly agreed"" without illustrating the work involved."
"452","Which of the following is an implicit assumption that the author makes in describing the reasons for the ""catastrophic deterioration"" of the White House?","A","80","The destruction of the White House was not the fault of its original builders.  When James Hoban designed a presidential palace to reflect George Washington's vision for a residence in 1792, he upheld the best architectural standards of his day.  By the time of the 1948–1952 renovation, however, there were plenty of people to blame for the White House's condition.  A combination of poor planning, carelessness, and neglect throughout the intervening years caused a catastrophic deterioration. (Paragraph 1)
Robert Klara recounts a history of changes to the White House that gradually compromised its structural integrity, beginning as far back as 1833 when Andrew Jackson had pipes installed for running water. (Paragraph 2)
In Paragraph 1 the author asserts that ""[t]he destruction of the White House was not the fault of its original builders.  When James Hoban designed a presidential palace…in 1792, he upheld the best architectural standards of his day.""  Instead, the author believes that later people's ""poor planning, carelessness, and neglect throughout the intervening years caused a catastrophic deterioration.""
Accordingly, the author assumes that upholding the best architectural standards of 1792 was sufficient to make the White House structurally sound.  Otherwise, the building's deterioration might have resulted from flaws in its original construction, rather than from ""a history of changes to the White House that gradually compromised its structural integrity"" (Paragraph 2).  Therefore, in describing the reasons for the ""catastrophic deterioration"" of the White House, the author makes the implicit assumption that the standards of sound architecture were well understood in 1792.
By contrast, the author does not assume that:
George Washington possessed some experience in designing buildings (Choice B).  Although the passage states that ""James Hoban designed a presidential palace to reflect George Washington's vision for a residence in 1792"" (Paragraph 1), it does not indicate that Washington himself designed the White House or had experience in designing buildings.
It would have been impossible for builders to more safely make changes to the White House (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 2, ""[t]he builders responsible for the many additions performed 'careless and foolish maneuvers that a first-year architecture student would never have made,' such as installing doorways in load-bearing walls or destroying the keystones of a brick arch.""  This description suggests the author believes that changes to the White House could have been made in a safer and more sensible way.
Presidents before Andrew Jackson made cosmetic changes to the White House (Choice D).  The author asserts that there was ""a history of changes to the White House that gradually compromised its structural integrity, beginning as far back as 1833 when Andrew Jackson had pipes installed for running water"" (Paragraph 2).  However, this claim does not necessarily indicate whether any other changes were made prior to 1833.  For example, there may have been no changes made at all, cosmetic changes, or structural changes that did not reduce the integrity of the building."
"453","Which of the following historical facts would be most unexpected, based on passage information about events from the time of the White House's construction to its eventual renovation?","D","80","The destruction of the White House was not the fault of its original builders.  When James Hoban designed a presidential palace to reflect George Washington's vision for a residence in 1792, he upheld the best architectural standards of his day. (Paragraph 1)
According to Paragraph 1, ""James Hoban designed a presidential palace to reflect George Washington's vision for a residence.""  Because the White House was originally built to reflect Washington's vision, it would be natural to expect that Washington himself would live in that residence once it was constructed.  Hence, it would be unexpected to learn that, in fact, George Washington never lived in the presidential mansion whose construction he initiated.
By contrast, based on information in the passage, none of the following historical facts run counter to expectations:
Calvin Coolidge outfitted the White House with secondhand pipes taken from Fort Meade army base (Choice A).  Paragraph 1 describes a ""combination of poor planning, carelessness, and neglect"" that contributed to the White House's ""catastrophic deterioration.""  Paragraph 3 provides examples of such neglect, stating that ""Calvin Coolidge scoffed at reports that the White House roof was unsafe until '[a] chunk of it broke off and bonked President Coolidge in the head,'"" and that Coolidge still ""only then begrudgingly agreed"" to repairs.  Given the passage's portrayal of Coolidge as unwilling to properly maintain the White House, the fact that he outfitted it with secondhand pipes taken from Fort Meade army base is unsurprising.
Andrew Johnson required the White House to be equipped with a telegraph (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 2, ""presidents added modern conveniences in pace with technological developments: gas lighting for James Polk, a telephone system for Rutherford Hayes, and air conditioning for Chester Arthur, among others.""  Therefore, although Andrew Johnson is not specifically mentioned in the passage, the idea that he required the White House to be equipped with a telegraph is unsurprising based on passage information.
Harry Truman won re-election in 1948 but had to vacate the White House anyway (Choice C).  The passage describes the ""1948–1952 renovation"" of the White House (Paragraph 1), noting that ""[t]he need to reconstruct the mansion reached a breaking point during the Harry Truman administration"" (Paragraph 4) and that ""there was little choice but to tear down and rebuild the White House"" (Paragraph 5).  Given the years-long destruction and rebuilding project, one could reasonably expect that Truman could not live in the White House at that time and had to vacate the premises despite winning re-election."
"454","For which of the following statements does the author provide the LEAST evidence in the passage?","D","80","Ultimately, there was little choice but to tear down and rebuild the White House.  The exterior façade was preserved, as were a few of the interior's furnishings and decorations.  Still, the extensive transformation left many feeling that the White House was no longer the same. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 5 states that ""the extensive transformation left many feeling that the White House was no longer the same"" after it had been torn down and rebuilt.  However, the author does not provide any further evidence to support this claim.
By contrast, the author provides more evidence for each of the following statements:
Those responsible for the White House were often neglectful or foolish (Choice A).  Paragraph 2 states that ""[t]he builders responsible for the many additions performed 'careless and foolish maneuvers that a first-year architecture student would never have made,' such as installing doorways in load-bearing walls or destroying the keystones of a brick arch.""  Similarly, Paragraph 3 describes ""President Roosevelt…allowing architect Charles McKim only four months to make repairs,"" while Calvin Coolidge ""scoffed at reports that the White House roof was unsafe"" and then agreed to repairs only ""begrudgingly.""
Some repairs to the White House caused as many problems as they solved (Choice B).  According to Paragraph 3, ""the repairs to which [Coolidge] only then begrudgingly agreed had a disastrous side effect: the weight of the roof was shifted away from the stronger outer walls to the weaker inner ones, causing enormous structural strain.""  Therefore, the passage indicates that some repairs to the White House solved one set of problems (i.e., the crumbling roof) while simultaneously causing others (i.e., enormous structural strain). 
Hoban did not anticipate the kinds of changes that would later be made to the White House (Choice C).  Paragraph 1 conveys that ""[w]hen James Hoban designed a presidential palace…in 1792, he upheld the best architectural standards of his day.""  Paragraph 2 then describes ""a history of changes to the White House…beginning as far back as 1833"" in which ""presidents added modern conveniences in pace with technological developments.""  Accordingly, the author depicts Hoban as producing a well-made building according to the standards of 1792, supporting the idea that ""[n]one of these advancements could have been anticipated by Hoban"" more than 40 years before they occurred."
"455","Given the information in the passage, the suggestion that Boethius may have ""found consolation in the thought that his fate had not been his fate"" (Paragraph 6) probably means that:","C","81","The philosophical Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge concerns the apparent incompatibility between human free will and God's knowledge of the future.  The dilemma proceeds as follows: Free will requires the ability to choose from among alternative possible actions.  But if God knows in advance what a person will do, then there are no possible alternatives, only a single guaranteed outcome conforming to God's prior knowledge.  Consequently, no act is performed freely but instead occurs of necessity. (Paragraph 1)
Various attempts have been made to resolve this dilemma, the most famous being the solution offered by the Roman consul Boethius….  Boethius fell under suspicion of sympathy to the Eastern empire and disloyalty to Theodoric, leading ultimately to his execution in 524 or 525.  It was during the imprisonment preceding this fate that he wrote The Consolation of Philosophy.… (Paragraph 2)
This conception of God's eternality…would seem to eliminate the grounds for thinking that God's knowledge of future actions precludes their being freely chosen. (Paragraph 4)
Boethius' death was brutal and, from our perspective, probably undeserved.  But perhaps in his final moments he found consolation in the thought that his fate had not been his fate. (Paragraph 6)
Paragraph 1 describes ""[t]he philosophical Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge,"" an argument that if God possesses knowledge of the future, then humans do not possess free will.  According to this argument, acting freely requires the power ""to choose from among alternative possible actions.""  But if God knows what a person will do in the future, then ""there are no possible alternatives, only a single guaranteed outcome conforming to God's prior knowledge.""  Therefore, if God knows the future, then free will is impossible because all events are a matter of fate, or what is destined to occur.
A potential solution to this dilemma was proposed by Boethius, who was scheduled to be executed and wrote about philosophy ""during the imprisonment preceding this fate"" (Paragraph 2).  Boethius believed that a correct understanding of God's eternality (existence outside of time) serves to ""eliminate the grounds for thinking that God's knowledge of future actions precludes their being freely chosen"" (Paragraph 4).  Thus, Boethius argued that God's foreknowledge does not actually mean that all events are fated in advance.
Accordingly, the author uses the term ""fate"" to refer to two different ideas: ""fate"" in the sense of an unavoidable destiny, and ""fate"" in the sense of what was done to Boethius (ie, the order to execute him).  However, Boethius believed he had proven that human events are not a matter of unavoidable destiny, even if God does know the future.  Therefore, the suggestion that Boethius may have ""found consolation in the thought that his fate had not been his fate"" (Paragraph 6) probably means that although he did not escape execution, Boethius knew that things could have turned out differently.
 (Choice A)  Boethius could find peace through accepting what happened to him.  Boethius was concerned with proving that there are ""possible alternatives"" to events in human lives, rather than ""only a single guaranteed outcome"" that ""occurs of necessity"" (Paragraph 1).  Therefore, the ""peace amidst his suffering"" (Paragraph 2) that Boethius attains is based in part on the idea that events like his punishment might not have occurred.  Accordingly, passage information does not suggest that Boethius would find peace through accepting what happened to him.
(Choice B)  despite facing execution, Boethius knew that his punishment was undeserved.  Paragraph 6 states that ""Boethius' death was brutal and, from our perspective, probably undeserved.""  However, the passage never discusses whether Boethius himself believed his punishment was deserved.  Moreover, the idea that Boethius' ""fate had not been his fate"" alludes to the question of whether fate governs human existence; it does not make reference to whether a person's experiences are deserved.
(Choice D)  Boethius believed that being executed would mean joining God in eternity.  Boethius believed in ""God's eternality"" (Paragraph 4), and it is possible that he also believed he would join God in the afterlife.  However, the passage never actually discusses Boethius' beliefs about life after death, nor suggests that such beliefs brought him comfort."
"456","According to the passage, Boethius' solution to the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma depends on the idea that:","B","81","The spirit's solution to the dilemma rests partially on rejecting the notion that God truly has foreknowledge as humans understand it.  As described in Book V of Boethius' work, human existence ""still lacks the future, while already having lost the past.""  Hence, the concept of foreknowledge arises from humanity's experience of events as a temporal succession.  But for God, who exists eternally, events are not temporal.  Past, present, and future are to God's mind what the impressions of a single moment are to human senses. (Paragraph 3)
It is only our experience of time which gives rise to the illusion that such knowledge interferes with free will.  Purportedly, then, God's timelessness resolves the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 3, Boethius' solution to the Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge involves ""rejecting the notion that God truly has foreknowledge as humans understand it.""  Boethius argues that it is misleading to say God has foreknowledge, because that concept ""arises from humanity's experience of events as a temporal succession.  But for God, who exists eternally, events are not temporal.""  In other words, God's knowledge of what humans call ""the future"" is not really foreknowledge, because unlike humans, God is wholly outside of time: ""Past, present, and future are to God's mind what the impressions of a single moment are to human senses.""
Consequently, Boethius claimed it is incorrect to think that God's awareness of future events constitutes knowing those events in advance.  This claim then serves as a key point in his argument that ""God's timelessness resolves the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, Boethius' solution to the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma depends on the idea that it is not really accurate to say that God possesses foreknowledge.
 (Choice A)  foreknowledge as a concept is based on the mistaken belief that humans experience time.  Paragraph 4 describes the idea that ""[i]t is only our experience of time which gives rise to the illusion that such knowledge interferes with free will.""  Therefore, Boethius did believe that humans experience time.  However, he contrasts this experience with that of God, who instead ""grasps the entirety of time as an immediate perception"" (Paragraph 3).  Thus, according to Boethius, the mistaken belief is not that humans experience time, but rather that God's knowledge of the future interferes with free will.
(Choice C)  foreknowledge relates to only one part of a broader philosophical issue.  Paragraph 5 states that ""[a]lthough there is much to admire in Boethius' reasoning, some philosophers note that a similar dilemma can be generated without referring to God.""  These philosophers believe that ""[t]he Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma would be subsumed under (ie, subordinate to) a broader Dilemma of Freedom and Future Truths.""  Accordingly, the idea that foreknowledge relates to only one part of a broader philosophical issue is ascribed to these other philosophers; it is not part of Boethius' argument.
(Choice D)  human understanding is insufficient to make conclusions about divine foreknowledge.  According to Paragraph 3, Boethius argues that ""when considering God's understanding of what we would call future events, 'it will be more correct to think of it not as a kind of foreknowledge of the future, but as the knowledge of a never ending presence.'""  Therefore, Boethius explicitly makes a conclusion about how divine foreknowledge should be understood.  Consequently, he does not suggest that human understanding is insufficient to make such conclusions."
"457","Which of the following inferences about Boethius' solution could be drawn from the passage?","B","81","However, Boethius fell under suspicion of sympathy to the Eastern empire and disloyalty to Theodoric, leading ultimately to his execution in 524 or 525.  It was during the imprisonment preceding this fate that he wrote The Consolation of Philosophy, so named because it personifies Philosophy as a comforting spirit who engages the reader in conversation.  Boethius receives her instruction, attaining peace amidst his suffering through the wisdom she imparts. (Paragraph 2)
According to Paragraph 2, during his imprisonment Boethius ""wrote The Consolation of Philosophy, so named because it personifies Philosophy as a comforting spirit who engages the reader in conversation.  Boethius receives her instruction, attaining peace amidst his suffering through the wisdom she imparts.""  Therefore, Boethius viewed the philosophical conclusions he described, such as his solution to the Dilemma of Freedom and Foreknowledge, as being a source of consolation and comfort for those who would read his work.  Consequently, it can be inferred that Boethius' solution is intended to ease the minds of those who consider it.
 (Choice A)  It is primarily a language-based argument about proper terminology.  Boethius' solution depends on ""rejecting the notion that God truly has foreknowledge as humans understand it"" (Paragraph 3).  However, his point is that it is a conceptual error, not just an issue of word choice, to think of God as having foreknowledge.  Boethius argues that one must differentiate between ""humanity's experience of events as a temporal succession"" and God's experience of ""grasp[ing] the entirety of time as an immediate perception"" (Paragraph 3).  Accordingly, the passage does not suggest that Boethius' solution to the dilemma is primarily a language-based argument about proper terminology.
(Choices C and D)  It is the most widely accepted solution to the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma; and It is considered the standard position by most philosophers, though not all.  Paragraph 2 states that ""[v]arious attempts have been made to resolve this dilemma, the most famous being the solution offered by the Roman consul Boethius.""  Paragraph 5 adds that ""there is much to admire in Boethius' reasoning.""  However, these claims do not necessarily imply that most philosophers accept Boethius' solution.  For instance, the fact that this solution is ""the most famous"" does not mean that it is viewed as successful.  Similarly, Boethius' argument could be considered a clever or worthy effort to resolve the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma, even if many philosophers believed it was ultimately inadequate.  Therefore, it cannot be inferred from the passage that Boethius' solution is considered the standard or most widely accepted position."
"458","Based on Paragraph 5, which of the following criticisms best describes how some philosophers view Boethius' solution?","A","81","Although there is much to admire in Boethius' reasoning, some philosophers note that a similar dilemma can be generated without referring to God.  On their view of the problem, God is essentially irrelevant because the threat to free will does not come from foreknowledge itself; it comes from the possibility that statements about future actions are true even before those actions occur.  Thus, the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma would be subsumed under a broader Dilemma of Freedom and Future Truths. (Paragraph 5)
According to the passage, some philosophers argue that the dilemma Boethius confronts is just one part of a larger issue.  Boethius is concerned with explaining how free will is compatible with God's knowledge of the future.  However, the philosophers mentioned in Paragraph 5 contend that ""a similar dilemma can be generated without referring to God.""  In their view, ""the threat to free will does not come from foreknowledge itself; it comes from the possibility that statements about future actions are true even before those actions occur.""  In other words, the problem is not that God (or anyone) knows the future; the problem is that it is already true what the future will be.
Therefore, these philosophers believe that ""the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma would be subsumed under (ie, subordinate to) a broader Dilemma of Freedom and Future Truths.""  In that case, the dilemma Boethius confronts would be a narrower version of a more general philosophical problem.  Consequently, the criticism that best describes how some philosophers view Boethius' solution is that it is too limited in scope.
 By contrast, these philosophers would not most likely make any of the following criticisms of Boethius' solution:
It depends on a rationalization (Choice B).  Paragraph 5 states that ""some philosophers note that a similar dilemma can be generated without referring to God.""  However, the passage never suggests that these philosophers are critical of Boethius' motivations, or that they view Boethius as failing to express legitimate reasons for his positions.
It cannot be supported empirically (Choice C).  According to Paragraph 5, some philosophers argue that ""the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma would be subsumed under a broader Dilemma of Freedom and Future Truths.""  However, this argument is based on the logical relationship between those two dilemmas, not on examining empirical evidence.  Specifically, while Boethius is concerned that God's foreknowledge seems to threaten free will, the philosophers mentioned argue that ""a similar dilemma can be generated without referring to God.""  Therefore, these philosophers are making a conceptual argument, not one that refers to empirical support.
It is based on poor reasoning (Choice D).  Paragraph 5 relates that ""[a]lthough there is much to admire in Boethius' reasoning, some philosophers note that a similar dilemma can be generated without referring to God.…  Thus, the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma would be subsumed under a broader Dilemma of Freedom and Future Truths.""  Accordingly, the passage suggests that these philosophers believe Boethius' solution addresses only one version of a larger philosophical issue, not that his solution was poorly reasoned."
"459","What is the purpose of the author's reference to humans being ""bounded in time as we are"" (Paragraph 5)?","C","81","Hence, the concept of foreknowledge arises from humanity's experience of events as a temporal succession.  But for God, who exists eternally, events are not temporal.  Past, present, and future are to God's mind what the impressions of a single moment are to human senses; God grasps the entirety of time as an immediate perception. (Paragraph 3)
It is only our experience of time which gives rise to the illusion that such knowledge interferes with free will.  Purportedly, then, God's timelessness resolves the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma. (Paragraph 4)
Thus, the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma would be subsumed under a broader Dilemma of Freedom and Future Truths.  Unfortunately, bounded in time as we are, that issue must remain beyond our present discussion…. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 3 discusses an important distinction that Boethius makes between humans and God with respect to time.  According to Boethius, the idea that God possesses foreknowledge ""arises from humanity's experience of events as a temporal succession.  But for God, who exists eternally, events are not temporal.""  Thus, Boethius asserts that humans exist in time while God exists outside of time, a point that is essential to his argument that ""God's timelessness resolves the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma"" (Paragraph 4).
Paragraph 5 then mentions the further problem that ""the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma would be subsumed under (ie, subordinate to) a broader Dilemma of Freedom and Future Truths.""  However, the author laments: ""Unfortunately, bounded in time as we are, that issue must remain beyond our present discussion,"" indicating that there is insufficient time to discuss this new subject.  Hence, by referring to humans as ""bounded in time,"" the author describes his or her time constraints by again alluding to Boethius' distinction between the human experience of time and God's timelessness.
Therefore, the purpose of the author's reference to humans being ""bounded in time as we are"" is that it alludes to a crucial distinction made previously in the passage.
 (Choice A)  It reinforces the idea that foreknowledge and free will are incompatible.  Paragraph 1 discusses ""the apparent incompatibility between human free will and God's knowledge of the future,"" or the argument that free will is impossible if God knows the future.  However, Boethius offers a solution to this problem, based on the idea that humans exist in time while God does not.  According to Boethius, this distinction between ""our experience of time"" and ""God's timelessness"" (Paragraph 4) shows that foreknowledge and free will are compatible after all.  Therefore, the author's reference to humans as ""bounded in time"" would not reinforce the idea that foreknowledge and free will are incompatible; rather, it alludes to Boethius' proposed solution to this ""apparent incompatibility"" (Paragraph 1).
(Choice B)  It implies that future truths cause more serious problems for free will than foreknowledge does.  Paragraph 5 mentions the view of some philosophers that ""the Freedom and Foreknowledge Dilemma would be subsumed under a broader Dilemma of Freedom and Future Truths.""  In these philosophers' view, this broader version of the problem is not addressed by Boethius' argument.  However, the reference to humans as ""bounded in time as we are"" is simply used to convey that there is insufficient time to discuss the ""broader Dilemma""; it does not itself imply that this dilemma causes more serious problems for free will.
(Choice D)  It helps clarify the rest of the information contained in that paragraph.  By remarking that the new issue ""must remain beyond our present discussion"" given that humans are ""bounded in time as we are"" (Paragraph 5), the author indicates that there is insufficient time to discuss the subject that has just been raised.  Accordingly, he or she implies that the information given in that paragraph will not be further clarified."
"460","Based on passage information, why did the legislation proposed by George Mason fail to pass?
The aristocracy believed noblesse oblige made legislation unnecessary.
Immoderation was too ingrained for prohibition to gain support.
Affluent members of society would be affected.","C","82","For the American ""nobility,"" the immoderation that had marked public life since before the Revolution assumed epic proportions in the later decades of the century.…  Indeed, libertine attitudes so dominated the population that George Mason IV, a congressional representative from the Commonwealth of Virginia, proposed that the federal government impose sumptuary legislation on all strata of society, including the affluent who would have traditionally been excluded from such laws.  However, the motion did not pass, with such social trends proving too deeply rooted.  Nevertheless, Mason was hardly alone in his alarm at the specter of mounting excess. (Paragraph 2)
Paragraph 2 states that ""the immoderation that had marked public life since before the Revolution assumed epic proportions"" and that ""the motion (ie, the proposed sumptuary legislation) did not pass, with such trends proving too deeply rooted.""  This evidence suggests that immoderation was not only widespread but had become so deeply ingrained in the society of the early American democratic republic that people resisted measures to prohibit it.  Accordingly, this circumstance would help to explain the legislation's failure to pass. (Number II)
According to Paragraph 2, ""the immoderation assumed epic proportions in the later decades of the century.""  Paragraph 3 then makes it clear that ""[t]he more established members of the republican gentility had long freely indulged in decadent consumption without attracting much attention.""  Regarding the legislation, Paragraph 2 states that the proposed sumptuary legislation would be imposed ""on all strata (ranks) of society, including the affluent who would have traditionally been excluded from such laws.""  Therefore, it can reasonably be inferred that the majority of the affluent would likely have opposed laws restricting their behavior. (Number III)
(Number I)  According to Paragraph 5, ""a movement materialized…mandat[ing] that eighteenth-century gentlemen as well as ladies project positive, even edifying, public images as their privileged position behooved (required of them).""  The result of the movement was ""a distinctly American variety of noblesse oblige (the duty of the privileged class to behave nobly and responsibly toward the less privileged) throughout the new democratic republic.""  This ""new paradigm (model)"" meant that ""keeping up appearances…became paramount (of greatest importance) in order to set examples of permissible public behavior…for the less affluent.""  However, the passage never directly connects this movement of noblesse oblige to the legislation being proposed by George Mason and its failing to pass."
"461","Based on the passage, what would be the best description of a ""rightful exterior signifier""?","B","82","In America's early democratic republic, the superficial signifiers of social status that had long distinguished the aristocracy in Europe were no longer supposed to apply. (Paragraph 1)
The presumptuous behavior mimicked by the lower classes led to an uproar by those in positions of power, who swiftly moved to modify societal conduct.  In particular, dissonance swelled in Massachusetts, where, within Boston's most select circles, a palpable anxiety over the maintenance of social hierarchies and their rightful exterior signifiers arose. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 1, ""the superficial signifiers of social status that had long distinguished the aristocracy in Europe were no longer supposed to apply.""  Paragraph 4 mentions that in Boston's ""most select circles,"" the elite experienced a ""palpable anxiety over the maintenance of social hierarchies and their rightful exterior signifiers.""  This information indicates that there was concern over the possible loss of the very signifiers or visible markers (ie, detectable status symbols) that had served to distinguish the upper class from the lower classes.  Therefore, based on the passage, a detectable status symbol would be the best description of a ""rightful exterior signifier.""
By contrast, none of the following would constitute a good description of a ""rightful exterior signifier"":
A legal entitlement (Choice A) would give an individual the right to obtain a particular benefit from the government, but it would not be outwardly visible.
A dress code (Choice C), even one that was mandatory (required), could lead to outward differences in appearance, but it would not necessarily be indicative of class or social status.
An inherited title (Choice D) could indicate social status but would not be visible."
"462","Based on the passage, which of the following would be the best example of the ""artful impostor""?","D","82","The presumptuous behavior mimicked by the lower classes led to an uproar by those in positions of power…For the elite few who made up America's haute monde, any posturing of manner or appropriation of dress disrupted the customary rigidity of the social hierarchy, which, to their dismay, had now become increasingly fluid.  There was a communal uneasiness, which grew into national dread, that artful impostors might slip through the boundaries of the social strata undetected.  Yet, vexingly, counterfeits were becoming more difficult to recognize.  Consequently, in order to restrict impersonation, those of questionable lineage faced the threat of ostracization for an act as simple as sitting for a portrait. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, ""[t]here was a communal uneasiness, which grew into national dread, that artful impostors might slip through the boundaries of the social strata (ranks) undetected.""  Paragraph 4 also conveys that ""vexingly, counterfeits were becoming more difficult to recognize.""  Indeed, through their dress and generally ""presumptuous behavior"" (arrogance), some individuals might succeed at maneuvering out of a lower social position and into a higher one, thereby disrupting ""the customary rigidity of the social hierarchy.""
For instance, a masquerade ball would normally be an event attended by the upper class where a servant would be present only in his/her capacity as a worker.  However, disguised in a costume appropriate for this kind of festivity, a servant might be able to slip through unnoticed, attend the ball, and mingle with the social elite.  Consequently, a servant wearing a costume to attend a masquerade ball would be a good example of an artful impostor who has the potential to disrupt the social hierarchy.
By contrast, none of the following would constitute as good an example of an artful impostor:
A criminal assuming the identity of a wealthy business owner (Choice A) is a kind of impostor trying to disguise his/her own identity.  However, the criminal is not necessarily trying to mask his/her social position.  Moreover, the original social status of the criminal is not indicated, so he/she might even be a wealthy individual.
A merchant seaman marrying a land-owning aristocrat (Choice B) may be trying to elevate his/her social position but would seem to be doing so openly rather than attempting to slip through unnoticed and disrupt the social order.
A rural farmer planning to conduct business in the city (Choice C) may be hoping to interact with members of the upper classes and perhaps to infiltrate their ranks, but there is no indication that he is disguising his identity.  Moreover, there is no way to know the nature of his business, with whom he will conduct it, or its potential for success."
"463","Based on information contained in the passage, which of the following would most likely be the greatest deterrent to a fluid social hierarchy?","A","82","For the elite few who made up America's haute monde, any posturing of manner or appropriation of dress disrupted the customary rigidity of the social hierarchy, which, to their dismay, had now become increasingly fluid.  There was a communal uneasiness, which grew into national dread, that artful impostors might slip through the boundaries of the social strata undetected.  Yet, vexingly, counterfeits were becoming more difficult to recognize.  Consequently, in order to restrict impersonation, those of questionable lineage faced the threat of ostracization for an act as simple as sitting for a portrait. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 4 cites ""the customary rigidity of the social hierarchy,"" whereby individuals generally remained in the social class or position into which they were born.  However, ""to their dismay,"" the upper class sensed that the social hierarchy was losing this rigidity and ""had now become increasingly fluid,"" partly because ""counterfeits were becoming more difficult to recognize.""
Paragraph 4 also states that ""in order to restrict impersonation, those of questionable lineage faced the threat of ostracization (banishment) for an act as simple as sitting for a portrait"" (something reserved at the time for the social elite).  Accordingly, banishment from society for engaging in activities above one's designated social position would most likely be a deterrent to a fluid social hierarchy.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 5 mentions that the elite classes were supposed to set ""examples of permissible public behavior for the…less affluent.""  However, this practice was largely ineffective, as Paragraph 5 later states that most Americans actually ""did their best not to emulate their 'role models.'""
(Choice C)  Paragraph 2 states that immoderation (excess) had ""marked public life since before the Revolution.""  This immoderation led to sumptuary laws being ""reinstituted in some states"" in the hopes of regulating behavior.  However, the passage provides no information about the laws or their effectiveness.  Consequently, reinstatement of such laws would not necessarily have been a deterrent to social fluidity.
(Choice D)  According to Paragraph 1, ""In America's early democratic republic, the superficial signifiers of social status that had long distinguished the aristocracy in Europe were no longer supposed to apply.""  However, Paragraph 1 also claims that the social elite ""flaunted their status"" while condemning ""any pretense by the lower classes to a higher social position.""  Therefore, it is likely that democratic values were not truly or widely accepted (or applied) and so would not have deterred the increasing social fluidity."
"464","With which of the following statements about noblesse oblige would the passage author most likely agree?","C","82","The new paradigm mandated that eighteenth-century gentlemen as well as ladies project positive, even edifying, public images, as their privileged position behooved.  Therefore, a distinctly American variety of noblesse oblige, though not without its detractors, spread throughout the new democratic republic.  In metropolitan centers across the new nation, the attributes of honor, modesty, and public virtue assumed increasing importance among the ""aristocracy.""  Keeping up appearances—that were oftentimes not all they seemed—became paramount in order to set examples of permissible public behavior for the benefit of those of humble birth or who were less affluent.  Meanwhile, the bulk of the American population, consisting of those with little wealth or status, did their best not to emulate their ""role models."" (Paragraph 5)
According to Paragraph 5, ""the attributes of honor, modesty, and public virtue assumed increasing importance among the 'aristocracy.'""  However, although ""keeping up appearances…became paramount"" in order to set an example for the lower strata of society, such appearances ""were oftentimes not all they seemed.""  This evidence indicates that the elite were just putting on a show to control the masses and had no true desire to change their own self-indulgent behavior.  Consequently, the noblesse oblige (the duty of the privileged class to behave nobly and responsibly toward the less privileged) movement involved hypocrisy (ie, claiming but not practicing moral standards).
(Choice A)  Paragraph 1 indicates that the elite ""flaunted their status at the same time that they condemned any pretense by the lower classes to a higher social position,"" despite the theory that America was a ""democratic republic.""  Moreover, Paragraph 5 claims that although elite republicans took it upon themselves to serve as ""role models"" by practicing noblesse oblige, such behavior drew attention to the demarcations (boundaries) between themselves and the lower classes.  In this way their privilege remained intact.  Therefore, passage evidence shows that the noblesse oblige movement was meant to benefit the wealthy, not the lower classes.
(Choice B)  Like the sumptuary laws, the noblesse oblige movement was meant to lead to certain constraints (limits) on the social behavior of the elite.  Consequently, these moderating laws would not need to be counterbalanced (corrected) by further societal restrictions.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 5 suggests that the practice of noblesse oblige did not truly deter social climbers who ""did their best not to emulate their 'role models'"" (ie, indicating they tried not to follow the new examples of modest conduct)."
"465","Based on the passage, the elders within elite society most likely:","C","82","The more established members of the republican gentility had long freely indulged in decadent consumption without attracting much attention.  Nevertheless, most of these older elites criticized their own younger generation, whose coming-of-age was characterized by more overt disregard for the Puritan austerity advocated by their forebears.  The self-gratifying taste for grande cuisine and propensities for haute couture of the upper-class youth were perceived as decidedly improper conduct by their elders. (Paragraph 3)
According to Paragraph 3, ""[t]he more established members (ie, older generation) of the republican gentility (the socially superior class) had long freely indulged in decadent (unrestrained) consumption without attracting much attention.""  Paragraph 3 also claims that in comparison, the younger generation had a ""more overt (open) disregard for the Puritan austerity (severe modesty) advocated by their forebears (ancestors).""  Therefore, the elders within elite society most likely engaged in decadent behavior discreetly (inconspicuously).
(Choice A)  Paragraph 3 states that the ""ostentatious comportment"" (behavior involving extravagant displays of wealth) of the upper-class youth ""influenced those from the inferior echelons (ranks) of society to adopt similar displays.""  Furthermore, Paragraph 4 notes that ""the presumptuous behavior mimicked by the lower classes led to an uproar by those in positions of power, who swiftly moved to modify societal conduct.""  This evidence indicates that the elite felt threatened by the indulgent behavior of the lower echelons (ranks) of society and so may have tried to control them, but they did not succeed very well.
(Choice B)  According to Paragraph 3, ""older elites criticized their own younger generation, whose coming-of-age was characterized by more overt disregard for the Puritan austerity advocated by their forebears.  The self-gratifying taste for grande cuisine and propensities for haute couture of the upper-class youth were perceived as decidedly improper conduct by their elders.""  This behavior ""worsened"" and ""influenced those from the inferior echelons of society to adopt similar displays,"" and, finally, according to Paragraph 4, ""led to an uproar by those in positions of power.""  This passage information indicates that the elders within elite society would not likely have supported reducing adherence to Puritan values, such as ""austerity,"" even though this might have allowed them to indulge themselves more freely.
(Choice D)  According to Paragraph 3, the younger generation's ""coming-of-age was characterized by more overt disregard for the Puritan austerity advocated by their forebears"" while, in contrast, the elders among elite society preferred to carry on their decadent behavior ""without attracting much attention"" (ie, more discreetly)."
"466","What is the primary purpose of the passage?","D","83","Although the primary canon in the history of political thought largely ignores the views of Immanuel Kant, he nevertheless was as important a political thinker as Rousseau, Locke, or even Aristotle. (Paragraph 1)
There are still other issues surrounding a Kantian theory of the state.  These will need to be dealt with separately, but they should not go overlooked.  Breaking down the barriers that leave Kant outside the primary canon of political theory is a laudable task, which will take much effort to accomplish. (Paragraph 5)
Paragraph 1 states that ""the history of political thought largely ignores the views of Immanuel Kant,"" but asserts that Kant ought to be included in ""the primary canon (ie, commonly studied figures or texts)"" of political thinkers because he ""was as important a political thinker as Rousseau, Locke, or even Aristotle.""  The passage goes on to discuss certain issues surrounding Kant's political theory, after which Paragraph 5 claims that ""issues surrounding a Kantian theory of the state…should not go overlooked"" because ""[b]reaking down the barriers that leave Kant outside the primary canon of political theory is a laudable (ie, praiseworthy) task.""
These points illustrate that ""[b]reaking down the barriers (ie, the issues facing Kant's view of the state) that leave Kant outside the primary canon of political theory"" is the author's intent in writing the passage.  The reason for ""[b]reaking down [these] barriers"" is to encourage political scholars to pay more attention to Kant's political theory; hence, this is the primary purpose of the passage.
(Choice A)  Although Paragraph 1 asserts that ""the primary canon in the history of political thought largely ignores the views of Immanuel Kant,"" this claim serves to introduce the author's larger point that Kant ""nevertheless was as important a political thinker as Rousseau, Locke, or even Aristotle,"" and thus that his political theory deserves more attention.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 5 advocates ""[b]reaking down the barriers"" that prevent Kant's views from being more widely studied.  However, the author does not argue that a Kantian view of the state should necessarily be adopted or endorsed.
(Choice C)  The passage discusses some resolutions to perceived shortcomings of Kantianism, such as the idea that ""Kantians may justify [welfare] legislation on the grounds that it serves an instrumentally necessary role"" despite seeming to contradict Kant's notion of political freedom (Paragraph 4).  However, Paragraph 5 suggests that this discussion is part of the author's method of ""[b]reaking down the barriers that place Kant outside the primary canon of political theory.""  This implies that the passage's main purpose is not to defend a Kantian conception of the state but rather to encourage broader study of Kant's political ideas."
"467","Which of the following is most illustrative of Kant's understanding of ""rational entities"" (Paragraph 4), as described in the passage?","C","83","Kant himself held that rational entities—such as persons, corporations, and states—have a duty of self-preservation, and thus are obligated to take measures to ensure their continued existence, security, and stability. (Paragraph 4)
According to Paragraph 4, Kant believed that ""rational entities—such as persons, corporations, and states—have a duty of self-preservation"" and, as such, must act in ways that ""ensure their continued existence, security, and stability.""  A city manager who provides funding to hire additional police officers because local crime rates are on the rise intends to decrease the city's crime rate and thereby ""ensure [the city's] continued existence, security, and stability"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, this manager is most illustrative of Kant's understanding of ""rational entities.""
By contrast, none of the following is most illustrative of Kant's understanding of ""rational entities"":
A successful retail chain raises its prices to increase profits, because it faces no real competition from other businesses (Choice A).  Successful retail chains with no real competition are not facing threats to ""their continued existence, security, and stability"" (Paragraph 4).  Accordingly, raising prices to increase profits would not constitute acting out of a ""duty for self-preservation"" (Paragraph 4).
A wealthy citizen provides substantial donations to local charities, in order to receive news coverage  (Choice B).  A wealthy citizen who donates to charity in order to receive news coverage would be trying to gain fame or recognition, not acting to ensure his or her ""continued existence, security, and stability"" (Paragraph 4).
A town council ignores reports of dangerous chemicals in the water supply, since public knowledge of this matter could hurt the local economy (Choice D).  A town council that ignores reports of dangerous chemicals in the water supply is failing to ensure the town's ""continued existence, security, and stability"" (Paragraph 4), even if doing so prevents the local economy from suffering."
"468","Suppose a study was conducted over several democratic societies with large populations.  In each society, the vast majority of citizens voted in favor of paying for assisted living services for the elderly.  This information would most strongly challenge which of the following assumptions made in the passage?","B","83","The Kantian notion of political freedom…refers to the innate right of every person to independence from being constrained by another's choice….  Laws that do not allow for political freedom are forbidden in Kant's view because within a just civil condition, the promulgation of a law requires that an entire people agree to be subjected to it. (Paragraph 2)
Given Kant's notion of political freedom, to enact [welfare] legislation would be catastrophic.  Welfare legislation violates Kant's own criterion regarding laws promulgated within a just civil condition: Governmental interference of this kind is a prime example of legislation on which an entire people will be divided. (Paragraph 3)
According to the author, the ""Kantian notion of political freedom…. requires that an entire people agree to be subjected to"" the laws of the state (Paragraph 2).  By contrast, welfare legislation is described as ""a prime example of legislation on which an entire people will be divided"" (Paragraph 3).  Therefore, the author assumes that political freedom conflicts with welfare legislation.
However, if the vast majority of a state's citizens vote in favor of paying for assisted living services for the elderly (ie, a form of welfare legislation), this would be an example of widespread agreement, rather than an ""example of legislation on which an entire people will be divided"" (Paragraph 3).  Accordingly, the author's assumption that political freedom conflicts with welfare legislation would be directly called into question.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 4 indicates that ""Kantians may justify [welfare] legislation on the grounds that it serves an instrumentally necessary role in upholding the fundamental aims and principles of Kantianism,"" and identifies political states as ""rational entities.""  However, the passage does not assume that a political state must support welfare legislation in order to be rational.
(Choice C)  In Paragraph 4, the author claims that Kant made ""an egregious (very bad) error"" in promoting welfare legislation.  However, the author goes on to say that Kantians (ie, advocates of a view similar to Kant's) ""may justify such legislation on the grounds that it serves an instrumentally necessary role in upholding the fundamental aims and principles of Kantianism itself"" (Paragraph 4).  Therefore, the author does not assume that Kantians who promote welfare legislation make an egregious error.
(Choice D)  According to the author, the ""Kantian notion of political freedom…refers to the innate (present from birth) right of every person to independence from being constrained by another's choice"" (Paragraph 2).  However, the author also states that ""[w]elfare legislation violates Kant's own criterion"" regarding this freedom (Paragraph 3).  Therefore, the author assumes that welfare legislation does not respect every person's innate right to free choice."
"469","To decide if welfare legislation is justified, proponents of a Kantian conception of the state would need to determine:","C","83","The Kantian notion of political freedom—which stands in stark contrast to the notion of transcendental freedom widely associated with Kant's nonpolitical writings—is restricted to the external relations between human persons.  In its political sense, freedom refers to the innate right of every person to independence from being constrained by another's choice.  In other words, every person has the innate right to make choices freely but only so long as these choices do not interfere with those of others. (Paragraph 2)
…[A] Kantian may hold that public provision of welfare is necessary for the state to fulfill its primary function—namely, protecting the liberties of its citizens.  For instance, if failing to adopt welfare legislation would threaten the continued existence, security, or stability of the state, then Kantians may justify such legislation on the grounds that it serves an instrumentally necessary role in upholding the fundamental aims and principles of Kantianism itself. (Paragraph 4)
Paragraph 2 describes the ""Kantian notion of political freedom,"" which ""refers to the innate (present from birth) right of every person to independence from being constrained by another's choice.""  Based on this understanding of Kantian political freedom, the passage conveys that ""proponents of a Kantian conception of the state…may hold that public provision of welfare is necessary for the state to fulfill its primary function—namely, protecting the liberties of its citizens"" (Paragraph 4).
Accordingly, in order to decide if welfare legislation is justified, proponents of a Kantian conception of the state would need to determine whether welfare legislation provides citizens with independence from being constrained by others.
(Choice A)  Paragraph 4 states: ""Although Kant did not explicitly advocate it himself, a Kantian may hold that public provision of welfare is necessary for the state…on the grounds that it serves an instrumentally necessary role in upholding the fundamental aims and principles of Kantianism itself.""  Therefore, proponents of a Kantian conception of the state would evaluate welfare legislation based on Kantian principles, but not necessarily on whether Kant himself advocated such legislation.
(Choice B)  Paragraph 4 states that ""a Kantian may hold that public provision of welfare is necessary for the state to fulfill its primary function—namely, protecting the liberties of its citizens.""  However, the passage never discusses political or social unrest, nor the influence of these on the state.
(Choice D)  Paragraph 4 states that Kantians may endorse enacting welfare legislation if it is ""instrumentally necessary"" in order for the state to protect ""the liberties of its citizens"" (ie, political freedom).  In that case, Kantians must determine whether welfare legislation is instrumentally necessary for political freedom, not the other way around."
"470","Which of the following assertions is supported by strong evidence in the passage?","A","83","This was an egregious error on Kant's part….  Although Kant did not explicitly advocate it himself, a Kantian may hold that public provision of welfare is necessary for…the continued existence, security, or stability of the state….  It is interesting to note that followers of Kant will likely have independent reasons to accept something along these lines.  Kant himself held that rational entities—such as persons, corporations, and states—have a duty for self-preservation, and thus are obligated to take measures to ensure their continued existence, security, and stability. (Paragraph 4)
The passage states that ""[w]elfare legislation violates Kant's own criterion"" of what makes laws just (Paragraph 3) and, accordingly, describes Kant's promotion of welfare legislation as ""an egregious error"" (Paragraph 4).  However, the passage goes on to state that ""[a]lthough Kant did not explicitly advocate it himself, a Kantian may hold that public provision of welfare is necessary for the state to fulfill its primary function—namely, protecting the liberties of its citizens"" (Paragraph 4).
The passage similarly argues that ""Kantians may justify such legislation on the grounds that it serves an instrumentally necessary role in upholding the fundamental aims and principles of Kantianism itself.""  For instance, welfare legislation may be justified according to the Kantian principle that ""states…are obligated to take measures to ensure their continued existence, security, and stability"" (Paragraph 4).
Therefore, the passage provides strong evidence that Kantian political theory justifies welfare legislation (even though Kant himself failed to justify it).
(Choice B)  The author states that of the ""substantive problems facing Kant's political theory….Most notable among these concerns is Kant's promotion of welfare legislation"" (Paragraph 3).  Even though the author asserts that ""[t]here are still other issues surrounding a Kantian view of the state"" (Paragraph 5), those issues are not portrayed as more notable than those discussed in the passage.
(Choice C)  Although the author claims that ""the primary canon in the history of political thought largely ignores the views of Immanuel Kant"" (Paragraph 1), the passage does not include any evidence to support this claim.
(Choice D)  The author states that the ""notion of transcendental freedom [is] widely associated with Kant's nonpolitical writings"" (Paragraph 2).  However, the passage does not discuss any examples of those writings, nor otherwise provide evidence in support of that claim."

Some information is processed automatically with little effort (eg, registering the characters on a license plate as letters or numbers), but to encode information, attention and effortful processing are often required (eg, encoding a specific license plate takes effort).
Elaboration is an example of an encoding strategy that can enhance memory.  With elaboration, new information is meaningfully associated with previously known information.  This effortful, deep processing tends to result in more connections to the new material, improving learning.
A scenario in which a student meaningfully associates the name and function of the amygdala (ie, new information) to her ""emotional"" friend named Amy (ie, previously known information) illustrates elaboration, an encoding strategy.
(Choice A)  The elaboration likelihood model (ELM) describes a message's persuasiveness based on how deeply or superficially it is processed and the characteristics of the audience (eg, motivation).  A scenario in which a student links new information to old information does not illustrate the ELM.
(Choice B)  The availability heuristic is the tendency to judge how common or likely something is based on how easily it is recalled (eg, assuming that shark attacks are common because one was recently reported on the news).  A scenario in which a student links new information to old information does not illustrate the availability heuristic.
(Choice D)  Associative learning is the linking of two events or stimuli.  For example, in operant conditioning, a behavior is associated with a consequence (ie, reinforcement or punishment).  A scenario in which a student links new information to old information does not illustrate associative learning.

Encoding involves the transfer of information into long-term memory.  Information that is attended to and processed more deeply tends to be remembered better."
"472","Which statement is NOT accurate regarding human social behavior?","B","84","Attachment styles
Secure
Insecure
Develops from sensitive, responsive caregivers
Infants readily explore a new environment when caregiver is near
Infants are distressed by a caregiver leaving & comforted on return
Associated with better long-term effects (eg, more satisfaction in adult relationships, greater health outcomes)
Develops from insensitive, unresponsive caregivers
In a new environment, infants are apathetic or overly clingy toward caregiver
Infants are indifferent to, or not comforted by, a caregiver's return
Associated with worse long-term effects (eg, less satisfaction in adult relationships, poorer health outcomes)
Attachment styles, which reflect the emotional bond between child and caregiver, are not formed during the first few hours after birth but rather form during the first few years of life as a result of repeated interactions.  The nature of this ongoing contact between child and caregiver can produce a secure or insecure attachment style.
Secure attachment typically results when caregivers are sensitive and responsive to a child's emotional needs (eg, readily soothing an upset infant).  Securely attached children develop confidence in their ability to explore the world around them and return to their caregivers as a consistent and nurturing base.
Insecure attachment can develop when caregivers do not consistently respond to a child's emotional needs (eg, often ignoring the infant).  Insecurely attached children do not develop confidence in their caregivers' ability to meet their needs, may act indifferent or clingy towards them, and may show little exploration overall.
(Choice A)  Early attachment styles impact an individual's relationships and well-being throughout their lifetime.  For example, individuals with a secure attachment style show less depression and drug abuse as adolescents and tend to be more satisfied with their romantic relationships as adults.
(Choice C)  Sensitive and responsive caregiving does tend to result in more secure attachments.
(Choice D)  Stranger anxiety, psychological distress caused by contact with unfamiliar individuals, peaks around age 1 year and declines as a child matures.  Stranger anxiety is a normal developmental milestone for infants.
Educational objective:
Attachment is the emotional bond between a child and caregiver.  Securely attached children typically have sensitive, responsive caregivers and are more confident in their ability to explore their environment.  Insecurely attached children typically have insensitive, inconsistent caregivers to which they act indifferent or clingy and are less likely to freely explore their environment."
"473","In a two-part procedure for teaching children with diabetes to self-inject insulin, a child is first shown a video of same-aged peers self-injecting insulin and is then given a sticker for each attempt to self-inject.  This procedure utilizes:","D","84","Types of learning
Operant conditioning
Occurs when the likelihood of repeating a behavior is influenced by the outcome of that behavior
Classical conditioning
Occurs when a stimulus that did not previously elicit a meaningful response takes on the properties of a biologically arousing stimulus after being paired
Observational learning
Occurs as the result of watching others engage in a behavior
Observational learning occurs as the result of watching others engage in a behavior.  For example, a child learns how to self-inject insulin by watching peers self-inject in a video.  There are four processes critical to observational learning: attention (focusing on others' behavior), retention (storing observations in memory), reproduction (imitating others' behavior), and motivation (incentive to imitate behavior).
Operant conditioning occurs when the likelihood of repeating a behavior is influenced by a consequence (ie, reinforcement or punishment).  Positive reinforcement increases/maintains behavior through the application of a desirable stimulus (ie, reinforcer).  Primary reinforcers are naturally rewarding (eg, candy), whereas secondary reinforcers are conditioned to be desirable (eg, stickers).
Therefore, a child learning to self-inject insulin by watching peers utilizes observational learning and rewarding the child with a sticker for attempting to self-inject utilizes secondary reinforcement.
(Choices A and B)  Classical conditioning occurs when a neutral stimulus that did not previously elicit a response takes on the properties of a biologically arousing (ie, unconditioned) stimulus after being paired (eg, infant fears a white toy rat after it is paired with a loud noise).  The procedure does not utilize classical conditioning.
(Choices B and C)  In a token economy, certain behaviors (eg, completing homework) are positively reinforced through the use of tokens (eg, gold stars), which are secondary reinforcers that can be exchanged for a desirable reward (eg, 5 gold stars can be exchanged for candy).  The procedure does not involve trading in secondary reinforcers for a desirable reward, so it is not utilizing a token economy.
Educational objective:
Observational learning occurs as the result of watching others.  Primary reinforcers are naturally rewarding (eg, food), whereas secondary reinforcers are conditioned to be desirable (eg, money)."
"474","A 34-year-old patient describes a history of conflict-ridden interpersonal relationships.  This pattern has been present since late adolescence, occurs across all settings, and has resulted in a history of sporadic employment and tumultuous romantic relationships.  The symptoms are not due to a medical condition or the use of a substance.  Which psychological diagnosis is most likely in this patient?","D","84","Personality disorders are characterized by inflexible and enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that differ markedly from social norms and cause functional impairment.  Individuals with personality disorders have pathological personal traits (eg, rigidity, greediness) and maladaptive patterns of relating to others (eg, hostility, superficiality) that are stable over time and across situations.
For someone with a pattern of conflict-ridden interpersonal relationships in all settings since late adolescence (ie, stable over time), resulting in a history of sporadic employment and tumultuous romantic relationships (ie, significant impairment), the most likely diagnosis is a personality disorder.
(Choice A)  Mood disorders (eg, depression) are characterized by persistent disruptions in emotional state.  Although individuals with mood disorders may experience social dysfunction (eg, lack of interest in socializing), this is a result of their mood symptomology, not an inflexible and enduring pattern of relating to others (ie, personality disorder).
(Choice B)  Anxiety disorders (eg, generalized anxiety disorder) are characterized by excessive worry.  Although individuals with anxiety disorders may experience social dysfunction (eg, declining social invitations due to anxiety), this is a result of their excessive worry, not an inflexible and enduring pattern of relating to others (ie, personality disorder).
(Choice C)  Dissociative disorders (eg, dissociative identity disorder) are characterized by disruptions in memory and identity.  Although individuals with dissociative disorders may experience social dysfunction (eg, through inconsistent interactions with loved ones), this is a result of their disruptions in memory and identity, not an inflexible and enduring pattern of relating to others (ie, personality disorder).
Educational objective:
Personality disorders are characterized by inflexible and enduring patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors differing markedly from social norms.  Personality disorders are stable over time and across environments and cause significant distress or impairment of functioning."
"475","Which of the following best illustrates a normative organization?","D","84","In sociology, organizations are social structures composed of individuals linked by specific purposes, tasks, and/or common goals.  The three main types of organizations are normative, utilitarian, and coercive.
In normative organizations, people voluntarily unite based on shared values and/or goals (eg, church congregations, sororities).
In utilitarian organizations, members are compensated for their involvement, typically through money (eg, paid employment) or certification/diploma (eg, university students).
In coercive organizations, membership is not freely chosen (eg, prisoners) and/or maintained (eg, military service members must be discharged).
A humanitarian group composed of physician volunteers illustrates an organization in which members are united by shared values and/or goals (ie, a normative organization).
(Choices A and C)  Medical residents and business consultants are compensated for their efforts in a residency program and the workforce, respectively (ie, through certification, pay).  Therefore, both a medical residency program and an insurance company that employs physicians as consultants illustrate utilitarian, not normative, organizations.
(Choice B)  An inpatient psychiatric ward in which involuntarily committed patients are unable to leave as they choose (ie, they must be evaluated and cleared by staff) illustrates a coercive, not a normative, organization.
Educational objective:
Organizations are social structures composed of individuals linked by specific purposes, tasks, and/or common goals.  In normative organizations, people come together based on shared values/goals, whereas utilitarian organizations compensate members for their involvement.  In coercive organizations, membership is not freely chosen and/or maintained."
"476","A pharmaceutical company is testing how much sugar should be added to a pediatric oral liquid suspension to make the medication more palatable.  Researchers determine that adding 0.2 g of sugar to 20 mL of oral suspension Z results in children detecting a just noticeable difference in taste.  Based on Weber's law, should the addition of 0.2 g of sugar to 50 mL of oral suspension Z be detectable 50% of the time?","D","84","The smallest difference between two stimuli a person can detect 50% of the time is called the just noticeable difference (JND), or difference threshold.  As the intensity of the original stimulus increases, the difference threshold also increases.  For example, although the difference between weights of 100 and 102 g may be detectable, the difference between weights of 500 and 502 g is not, even though the difference is also 2 g.
This relationship is quantified by Weber's law, which states that the ratio of the size of the JND to the original stimulus intensity remains constant.  In other words, the change in a stimulus needed to detect a difference is a constant proportion (ie, if one can just detect a difference between weights of 100 and 102 g, the difference between weights of 500 and 510 g would also be just detectable).
If the addition of 0.2 g of sugar to 20 mL of suspension Z is just noticeable 50% of the time, then for a volume that is 2.5 times bigger (20 mL × 2.5 = 50 mL), 0.5 g of sugar (0.2 g × 2.5 = 0.5 g) would be the JND.  Therefore, the addition of 0.2 g of sugar to 50 mL of oral suspension Z would not be detectable because Weber's law is based on a ratio.
(Choice A)  The addition of 0.2 g of sugar is the JND for 20 mL of suspension; for 50 mL of suspension the JND is 2.5 times greater, or 0.5 g.  Therefore, anything less than 0.5 g should not be detectable 50% of the time.
(Choice B)  Weber's law is based on a constant proportion, not a constant value, so the addition of 0.2 g of sugar to 50 mL of oral suspension Z should not be detectable 50% of the time.
(Choice C)  The absolute threshold is the intensity value at which an individual can detect a stimulus 50% of the time; 0.2 g represents the difference threshold, or the smallest difference between two stimuli that can be detected 50% of the time, not the absolute threshold.
Educational objective:
Weber's law states that the proportion of the just noticeable difference (the smallest difference between two stimuli a person can detect 50% of the time) to the original stimulus intensity is a constant."
