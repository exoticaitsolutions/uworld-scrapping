1,Passage Title: The Caves of Lascaux,"In September 1940, near the tiny village of Montignac in the southwest region of France, a band of four youths and a dog accidentally stumbled upon the opening to a series of underground caverns whose walls were covered with prehistoric paintings.  Their monumental discovery unleashed a mystery that has continued to puzzle scholars: What function did these magnificent caves perform for the society that painted them?  One plausible theory, yet unproven, is that they constituted a kind of sacred space, perhaps a site for religious ceremonies.
Decades of work recording and analyzing the contents of this labyrinthine underworld, which came to be called Lascaux, have yielded some clues.  Pollen testing, carbon-14 dating, and the examination of flint and bone tools within the caves have been used to calculate the time period during which these subterranean reaches were painted and served their function.  The paintings date from between 17,000 and 12,000 BCE, which places them within the Upper Paleolithic era.  More specifically, they belong to the Magdalenian period of the last ice age that preceded the dawn of the current geological epoch and the invention of agriculture.
More than 2,000 paintings and symbols cover the insides of the caverns.  Approximately 900 of these depict horses, bison, stags, large felines, and hares, clearly reflecting a society of hunter-gatherers.  Various pigments, mainly red, yellow, and brown, were used.  By employing a novel method that took advantage of the edges and curvatures of the cave walls, the artists were able to give lifelike dimensions to these images and endow them with a sense of motion.  Nevertheless, the cave art of Lascaux suggests a purpose that goes beyond artistic expression.
It is likely these chambers served as a sanctuary within which the paintings would have corresponded to the iconography of a temple.  Moreover, countless footprints shown to have belonged to adolescent males suggest that the caves may have hosted initiation rituals marking a boy's passage from childhood to maturity.  At this critical juncture, the youths would have traditionally been separated from their families by the adult males and put through frightening ordeals.  The boys might have been tattooed, confined, or presented with physical challenges.  The purpose of such traumas was to prepare the adolescent for the physical and psychological rigors of the hunt, the brutalities of warfare, and the inevitable trials of adulthood.  Theologian Karen Armstrong describes such experiences as triggering ""a regressive disorganization of the personality"" followed by ""a constructive reorganization"" of the individual's faculties.  In other words, the rites were meant to force the youth to call upon inner resources of which he was not yet aware, thereby inducing a kind of psychological death and rebirth.
Lying deep within the earth, the caves would have provided the perfect container for these traumatic rites—a fact that became evident when Lascaux was opened to the public in 1948.  As mythologist Joseph Campbell recalled of his visit there, when the lights were out, all normal orientation and sense of time were suspended and ""you were never in darker darkness in your life.""  In primitive societies, descending into the darkness of the caves must have seemed like immersing oneself in what religious historian Mircea Eliade has termed ""sacred time,"" a kind of dissociative state conducive to the deeply transformative experience of the initiate.  When illuminated against the blackness, the realistic murals would have become a moving spectacle that simulated the hunt, the wonder and gravity of which was forever imprinted upon the boys' psyches.",Critical Analysis & Reasoning Skills,6,Social Sciences

9,"Passage Title: ""Enlightened"" Architecture","Situated near Weems, Virginia, Christ Church has long belied its appearance as a typical, if elite, Anglican house of worship from the colonial era.  Some have conjectured that the 1735 building is based on a prototype by the renowned English architect Christopher Wren, and, in truth, its resemblance to Farley Church in Wiltshire, England, which he designed, is almost uncanny.  Originally an unassuming wooden construct, Christ Church was commissioned in 1665 by John Carter, a wealthy tobacco planter who had come from his native England to Virginian shores three decades earlier.  In 1730, his son Robert—by then one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in the region—was determined to replace the structure of wood with one of brick.  He died two years later, leaving behind three male offspring to oversee the completion of what experts would later hail as ""the most finely crafted Anglican parish church in all of colonial Virginia.""  Indeed, historical websites laud it as ""an extraordinary example of eighteenth-century architecture, featuring meticulous brickwork, vaulted ceilings, and gorgeous compass-headed windows.""  Notably, the church also contains a triple-decker pulpit—a rare but distinctive feature of its era.  In recent decades, however, Christ Church has become a subject of interest more for what it conceals than for what it reveals.
The intricacies of this remarkable building point to its duality in being not only a religious sanctuary, but a shrine to rationality, a veritable temple of the Enlightenment.  Beneath its surface, Christ Church constitutes an architectural feat of mathematical precision in harmony with nature's laws.  Indeed, horologist H. Stephen Stewart has characterized it as ""a building of numbers""—specifically, calendric, solar, and lunar numbers.  As Stewart explains, two weeks after the vernal equinox, on the mean date for Easter, a sunbeam shines through the oval window above the main entrance that faces due west and rests upon the altar; this phenomenon repeats itself two weeks prior to the autumnal equinox.  Moreover, a shadow cast from a cornice of the building, moving vertically along the church's outer west wall at the pace of a single row of bricks per day, tracks the progression from spring to fall.  For eight hours daily, the structure also acts as a sundial, casting its shadow on the north lawn.  A seemingly multifunctional edifice, Christ Church, as Stewart astutely concluded, is a virtual ""time machine.""
The locale and physical orientation of this sacred structure were critical: not just any terrestrial site could offer complete celestial alignment.  As a result, Christ Church has basked in splendid isolation amidst an untamed countryside in a spot described by journalist Joy Aschenbach as ""a rather lonely one, with woods all around, few or no houses near, and no good roads.""  Its exchange of geographical remoteness for astronomical positioning recalls another singular sanctuary, the fifth-century BCE Temple to Apollo, the god of the sun and rationality, at Bassae in Greece.  Thrust deep into the rural expanse, this imposing temple—whose design has been attributed to the same architect as the Athenian Parthenon—sits atop Kotylion Mountain.  There, this previously forgotten structure holds dominion over a desolate landscape through which, prior to the last century, no truly passable road led.  Oriented north to south rather than (the more typical) east to west, the building seems calibrated to track the sun's annual phases.  Like the church, the temple has moved from dilapidation to restoration, becoming the focus of scrutiny as scientists decipher the calculus of its blueprint.

12,"Passage Title: ""Enlightened"" Architecture","Situated near Weems, Virginia, Christ Church has long belied its appearance as a typical, if elite, Anglican house of worship from the colonial era.  Some have conjectured that the 1735 building is based on a prototype by the renowned English architect Christopher Wren, and, in truth, its resemblance to Farley Church in Wiltshire, England, which he designed, is almost uncanny.  Originally an unassuming wooden construct, Christ Church was commissioned in 1665 by John Carter, a wealthy tobacco planter who had come from his native England to Virginian shores three decades earlier.  In 1730, his son Robert—by then one of the wealthiest and most influential figures in the region—was determined to replace the structure of wood with one of brick.  He died two years later, leaving behind three male offspring to oversee the completion of what experts would later hail as ""the most finely crafted Anglican parish church in all of colonial Virginia.""  Indeed, historical websites laud it as ""an extraordinary example of eighteenth-century architecture, featuring meticulous brickwork, vaulted ceilings, and gorgeous compass-headed windows.""  Notably, the church also contains a triple-decker pulpit—a rare but distinctive feature of its era.  In recent decades, however, Christ Church has become a subject of interest more for what it conceals than for what it reveals.
The intricacies of this remarkable building point to its duality in being not only a religious sanctuary, but a shrine to rationality, a veritable temple of the Enlightenment.  Beneath its surface, Christ Church constitutes an architectural feat of mathematical precision in harmony with nature's laws.  Indeed, horologist H. Stephen Stewart has characterized it as ""a building of numbers""—specifically, calendric, solar, and lunar numbers.  As Stewart explains, two weeks after the vernal equinox, on the mean date for Easter, a sunbeam shines through the oval window above the main entrance that faces due west and rests upon the altar; this phenomenon repeats itself two weeks prior to the autumnal equinox.  Moreover, a shadow cast from a cornice of the building, moving vertically along the church's outer west wall at the pace of a single row of bricks per day, tracks the progression from spring to fall.  For eight hours daily, the structure also acts as a sundial, casting its shadow on the north lawn.  A seemingly multifunctional edifice, Christ Church, as Stewart astutely concluded, is a virtual ""time machine.""
The locale and physical orientation of this sacred structure were critical: not just any terrestrial site could offer complete celestial alignment.  As a result, Christ Church has basked in splendid isolation amidst an untamed countryside in a spot described by journalist Joy Aschenbach as ""a rather lonely one, with woods all around, few or no houses near, and no good roads.""  Its exchange of geographical remoteness for astronomical positioning recalls another singular sanctuary, the fifth-century BCE Temple to Apollo, the god of the sun and rationality, at Bassae in Greece.  Thrust deep into the rural expanse, this imposing temple—whose design has been attributed to the same architect as the Athenian Parthenon—sits atop Kotylion Mountain.  There, this previously forgotten structure holds dominion over a desolate landscape through which, prior to the last century, no truly passable road led.  Oriented north to south rather than (the more typical) east to west, the building seems calibrated to track the sun's annual phases.

14,Passage Title: Value Expression as Constituent of Art,"Art has always been an expression of values: from the earliest cave paintings to modern abstract sculpture, works of art are physical embodiments of a people's mores, experiences, and assumptions.  The study of such works thus provides not only insight into the societies that create them, but comparative grounds for exploring cultural differences among their contemporaries.  For instance, pre-Roman Etruscan art evinces a surprising level of freedom for women relative to other societies.  The Cerveteri Sarcophagus includes a sculpture of a husband and wife reclining and eating together; similarly, a mural adorning the Tomb of Leopards displays several married couples dining in this fashion at a banquet.  To the ancient Greeks, however, this Etruscan practice was an unthinkable scandal: as one historian points out, ""It was so foreign to the Greeks that it both shocked and frightened them.""  At Greek dinners, the only women who attended were servants and paid companions; the men's wives ""remained at home, excluded from most aspects of public life.""
To modern ears, this Greek conception of propriety must sound absurd or even humorous.  Nevertheless, it exemplifies the effect of cultural contact in challenging a society's values, whether through direct observation of a practice or mediated through the art that displays it.  Of course, that function of art also operates within a society, and this self-reflection and critique of cultural ethos is one of art's most important functions.  This is not necessarily to say that art must offer such a challenge to be great; indeed, there are many works that have extraordinary aesthetic worth simply for what they represent.  Still, the importance of art in posing difficult, even painful, questions cannot be overstated.
What is truly bizarre, however, is when art seems neither to reflect nor to challenge the values of its time.  It might be wondered how such a scenario would be possible, as any depiction that did not reflect a society's character would at least suggest a tension with it.  Yet the world of early television provides an example.  In most shows of the 1950s and 1960s, like The Dick Van Dyke Show and I Love Lucy, the master bedrooms contained pairs of twin beds where the husbands and wives slept separately.
This television standard is hard to understand, in part because the implicit moral claims involved do not exemplify the kinds of cultural differences described above.  The American audiences of American television were not another society at risk of being shocked and frightened by unfamiliar customs, as the Greeks experienced with the Etruscans.  Nor can the standard be easily attributed to attitudes evolving over time; although much of what modern viewers take for granted would seem indecent to viewers of the past, surely the idea of a married couple occupying the same bed does not fall into that category.  Thus, the prohibition against depicting that practice could only have ""protected"" audiences from something wholly uncontroversial.  As such, this aspect of early television programming represented neither life as it is nor life as it ought to be—nor even how anyone thought life ought to be.  In this respect, then, does it simply fail to constitute art?
Although that conclusion seems in general justified, perhaps it is more accurate to say that the artistic value is diminished or suppressed, rather than absent entirely.  After all, any purposeful representation of life or fantasy is arguably art in some sense.  Hence, it may be useful to conceive of art and non-art less as distinct categories, and more as points along a continuum.  From that perspective, to be art is something that is achieved to a greater or lesser degree.",Critical Analysis & Reasoning Skills,4,Humanities

19,Passage Title: What is Dance?,"People sometimes dance for joy, or report that they are so happy that they could dance for joy.  However, one might wonder why this is so.  What is it about happiness that would lead someone to dance?  What exactly is dancing, when one ponders this activity that might otherwise be taken for granted?  Is it only a human practice, or is dancing something in which other animals also engage?
Indeed, some animals do seem to dance, although their reasons for doing so are goal-based.  For instance, bees dance to provide information to other colony members, using complicated movements to describe the location and quality of a food source.  This behavior is not emotive; it would seem odd, if not unscientific, to ascribe an emotive character to such displays.  Nevertheless, these displays are communicative, as are emotive human behaviors.
Might this similarity bespeak a common evolutionary basis for the dance of humans and other animals?  Perhaps, although there are differences which cast doubt on that hypothesis.  A bee's dance is its main method of communication, whereas most human communication is vocal.  Even with non-vocal communication such as sign language, the types of bodily movements are qualitatively different from those used in dance, as dance movements signify at most a general feeling or impression rather than corresponding to specific words or ideas.  If the bee's dance functions like human sign language (albeit in a much less sophisticated form), it is probably not an appropriate analogue to human dance at all; the term ""dance"" would be simply a weak metaphor.  Thus, if the bee's dance is a type of language, it is not the same sort of thing as human dance.
Still, there are other types of animal behaviors that might more aptly be called dances.  Many animals perform courtship displays of varying complexity, in which carefully choreographed movements are designed to win the favor of a potential mate.  Historically, a connection between human dance and courtship has also been assumed, and often cautioned against.  For instance, in the 1950s Elvis was denounced by parents as a corrupting influence upon the young women who swooned over him, and some of his dance moves were censored.  People today likewise voice concerns with regard to the behavior of crowds in nightclubs and explicit lyrics in popular music.  A similar outcry will undoubtedly be heard in the future, as the struggle of parental restraint against youthful vigor continues.
It should not be thought, however, that all amorous dancing is subject to condemnation.  Weddings include dance as a matter of custom, suggesting a long-standing endorsement within socially approved couplings.  Through social tradition or natural instinct, dance seems linked with romance in the human mind.  Nevertheless, such a connection is clearly not the whole story.  One of the most fundamental uses of dance is the physical expression of music—a language not of words, but emotion.
If music expresses emotion and dance expresses music, then, do we dance not only ""for joy"" but for all emotions?  Seemingly not, but why?  Certainly, music itself conveys a wide spectrum of feelings.  Although we do not dance ""for sadness"" or ""for anger,"" we do droop our bodies or clench our fists, and perhaps more subtle emotions produce other physical markers.  Still, happiness too can be seen in a smile, and to actually dance for joy is comparatively rare.  Is dance then truly an entity unto itself?  Or, is it merely one instance of a wider class of physical behaviors?",Critical Analysis & Reasoning Skills,6,Humanities

Although we do not dance ""for sadness"" or ""for anger,"" we do droop our bodies or clench our fists, and perhaps more subtle emotions produce other physical markers.  Still, happiness too can be seen in a smile, and to actually dance for joy is comparatively rare.  Is dance then truly an entity unto itself?  Or, is it merely one instance of a wider class of physical behaviors?",Critical Analysis & Reasoning Skills,6,Humanities
22,Passage Title: What is Dance?,"People sometimes dance for joy, or report that they are so happy that they could dance for joy.  However, one might wonder why this is so.  What is it about happiness that would lead someone to dance?  What exactly is dancing, when one ponders this activity that might otherwise be taken for granted?  Is it only a human practice, or is dancing something in which other animals also engage?
Indeed, some animals do seem to dance, although their reasons for doing so are goal-based.  For instance, bees dance to provide information to other colony members, using complicated movements to describe the location and quality of a food source.  This behavior is not emotive; it would seem odd, if not unscientific, to ascribe an emotive character to such displays.  Nevertheless, these displays are communicative, as are emotive human behaviors.
Might this similarity bespeak a common evolutionary basis for the dance of humans and other animals?  Perhaps, although there are differences which cast doubt on that hypothesis.  A bee's dance is its main method of communication, whereas most human communication is vocal.  Even with non-vocal communication such as sign language, the types of bodily movements are qualitatively different from those used in dance, as dance movements signify at most a general feeling or impression rather than corresponding to specific words or ideas.  If the bee's dance functions like human sign language (albeit in a much less sophisticated form), it is probably not an appropriate analogue to human dance at all; the term ""dance"" would be simply a weak metaphor.  Thus, if the bee's dance is a type of language, it is not the same sort of thing as human dance.
Still, there are other types of animal behaviors that might more aptly be called dances.  Many animals perform courtship displays of varying complexity, in which carefully choreographed movements are designed to win the favor of a potential mate.  Historically, a connection between human dance and courtship has also been assumed, and often cautioned against.  For instance, in the 1950s Elvis was denounced by parents as a corrupting influence upon the young women who swooned over him, and some of his dance moves were censored.  People today likewise voice concerns with regard to the behavior of crowds in nightclubs and explicit lyrics in popular music.  A similar outcry will undoubtedly be heard in the future, as the struggle of parental restraint against youthful vigor continues.
It should not be thought, however, that all amorous dancing is subject to condemnation.  Weddings include dance as a matter of custom, suggesting a long-standing endorsement within socially approved couplings.  Through social tradition or natural instinct, dance seems linked with romance in the human mind.  Nevertheless, such a connection is clearly not the whole story.  One of the most fundamental uses of dance is the physical expression of music—a language not of words, but emotion.

26,Passage Title: Translation,"Of the myriad problems facing translators, perhaps the most significant lies in the tension between what a text conveys and the words used to convey it.  Strict fidelity to the specific words of a text often fails to capture the full sense of its meaning.  Beyond this loss of meaning can also arise a loss of artistry and structural features that often cannot be replicated.
For instance, a fully evocative rendering of the 119th Psalm seems unattainable.  Comprising twenty-two strophes of eight lines each, the one hundred and seventy-six verses do appear somewhat poetic in translation.  But in the original Hebrew the Psalm is an acrostic: the verses of the first strophe all begin with the letter aleph, those of the second with beth, and so on, with tav, the last letter of the alphabet, commencing the final eight verses.  The reader of a translation would, understandably, be ignorant of this fact.  While this does not affect the essential meaning of the verses, it does affect their character—something is lost from the original in its non-native presentation.  Although there have been occasional attempts to mimic this structure in other languages, they have all been unsuccessful.  The tortured and unnatural wording that results proves the wisdom of most translators in prioritizing readability.  Nevertheless, the Psalmist wrote with a particular purpose that is left untransmitted.  The sacrifice of the acrostic, however necessary, is regrettable.
Another concern is what might be called translational multiplicity.  Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges famously remarked: ""The Quixote, due to my congenital practice of Spanish, is a uniform monument, with no other variations….  [T]he Odyssey, thanks to my opportune ignorance of Greek, is an international bookstore of works in prose and verse.""  To speak of ""the"" Odyssey—or more generally, ""the"" text of any work—runs headlong into the reality that for translated works, ""the text"" is not a single entity but a collection of candidates.  Thus, a perennial difficulty of translation is conveyed through Borges' idiosyncratic expression.  Or is it?  For Borges' remarks are elsewhere listed as: ""Since Spanish is my native language, the Quixote is to me an unchanging monument, with no possible variations….  But the Odyssey, thanks to my opportune ignorance of Greek, is a library of works in prose and verse.""  That we might ask which of these translations more closely represents his actual words is a fact that Borges would likely have found amusing.
Considerations of this sort are magnified when one approaches the writings not only of individual authors, but of past civilizations.  Despite being one of the world's foremost sinologists, the late D. C. Lau was convinced that none of us truly understand classical Chinese.  The sentiment was no mere expression of modesty; fellow scholar Roger Ames described Lau as ""[h]aving assimilated the classical corpus through a lifetime of careful study and reflection.""  Rather, Lau was keenly aware of a difficult truth: the fluidity of language and culture over time can shroud the works of the ancients in obscurities that may be inscrutable to even their most passionately curious descendants.
Modern works may also be altered, however, and sometimes through more subtle types of translation.  The book known as Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in England was changed to refer instead to the ""Sorcerer's Stone"" in the United States, reportedly due to a belief that the original title would be unpalatable to an American audience.  While that depressing assumption may indeed have been correct, the change removes a titular connection to a pre-existing myth.

31,Passage Title: Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence of the Same,"In August of 1881, the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was walking beside a Swiss Alpine lake when a thought that he would alternately extol and execrate as ""the thought of all thoughts""—one that would beleaguer the rest of his life and work—flashed through his mind.  The thought first appears in Nietzsche's 1882 collection of aphorisms, The Gay Science, as a hypothetical question: ""What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence….?'""  A curious intertwining of infinity, repetition, and fate, known as the Eternal Recurrence of the Same, this idea would itself recur in the philosopher's writing, particularly in his self-proclaimed masterwork and quasi-hermetic text Thus Spake Zarathustra.
Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence, or the notion that, as Steven Gambardella expresses it, ""time is a circle and all things are bound and repeated for eternity,"" defies literal belief; however, it should not be reduced to a metaphor nor dismissed as, in one scholar's words, ""a bizarre, fanciful, and poetic idea.""  More properly, Gambardella proposes, it is ""part-parable, part-thought-experiment,"" a stern summons to re-examine our relationship with life and carefully consider the consequences of our choices.  In Gambardella's view, Nietzsche's concept provides ""an alternative ethical benchmark to religious ethical systems.""  Whereas many religions promise followers an afterlife of eternal reward or punishment based on conduct in this life, Nietzsche posits only the prospect of ""an impermanent life repeating eternally.""  Similarly, Lawrence Hatab describes the Nietzschean universe as ""a finite-world-in-infinite-process.""  This endless repetition of the same has, Hatab stresses, the power to eradicate all metaphysics, remove the teleology associated with linear time, and erase ""all afters and beyonds,"" leaving nothing but ""the here and now.""
The consequent eternalization of the transitory moment underlies what Nietzsche considers the superlative struggle.  As the philosopher explains, ""The question in each and every thing is, 'Do you desire this once more and innumerable times more?'

32,Passage Title: Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence of the Same,"In August of 1881, the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was walking beside a Swiss Alpine lake when a thought that he would alternately extol and execrate as ""the thought of all thoughts""—one that would beleaguer the rest of his life and work—flashed through his mind.  The thought first appears in Nietzsche's 1882 collection of aphorisms, The Gay Science, as a hypothetical question: ""What if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence….?'""  A curious intertwining of infinity, repetition, and fate, known as the Eternal Recurrence of the Same, this idea would itself recur in the philosopher's writing, particularly in his self-proclaimed masterwork and quasi-hermetic text Thus Spake Zarathustra.
Nietzsche's Eternal Recurrence, or the notion that, as Steven Gambardella expresses it, ""time is a circle and all things are bound and repeated for eternity,"" defies literal belief; however, it should not be reduced to a metaphor nor dismissed as, in one scholar's words, ""a bizarre, fanciful, and poetic idea.""  More properly, Gambardella proposes, it is ""part-parable, part-thought-experiment,"" a stern summons to re-examine our relationship with life and carefully consider the consequences of our choices.  In Gambardella's view, Nietzsche's concept provides ""an alternative ethical benchmark to religious ethical systems.""  Whereas many religions promise followers an afterlife of eternal reward or punishment based on conduct in this life, Nietzsche posits only the prospect of ""an impermanent life repeating eternally.""  Similarly, Lawrence Hatab describes the Nietzschean universe as ""a finite-world-in-infinite-process.""  This endless repetition of the same has, Hatab stresses, the power to eradicate all metaphysics, remove the teleology associated with linear time, and erase ""all afters and beyonds,"" leaving nothing but ""the here and now.""
The consequent eternalization of the transitory moment underlies what Nietzsche considers the superlative struggle.

36,Passage Title: Film Noir,"Dominated by stock character types and gloomy urban settings, film noir is a highly stylized art form with plots that pivot around crime and intrigue.  Chiefly a product of 1940s and 1950s Hollywood, noir was arguably more an approach, mood, or sensibility than a discrete genre.  Noir drew inspiration for its scenery from classic movies about bootlegging and heists but primarily imported its storylines and dialogue from the crime novels and pulp magazine tales of the Depression Era.  At the same time, noir imitated the unsettling cinematography of the German expressionist movement of the 1920s and borrowed from French poetic realist cinema a fundamentally jaundiced and tragic worldview.  As an unlikely amalgamation of ideas and styles, film noir also readily absorbed other contemporary cultural strains, notably existentialism and psychoanalysis.
Most noir-type films belong to what is known as the ""B"" movie category—low-budget, black-and-white motion pictures originally produced to accompany a higher-budget or ""A"" film as a double feature—and display certain conventions that give them a distinguishing character.  Apart from a brooding mood, or pervasive sense of pessimism and meaninglessness, noir conventions include the investigation of a crime and a difficult-to-decipher plot unfolding in flashback sequences accompanied by voiceover narration.  Camera angles are distorting and disorienting, creating a sense of menace.  Chiaroscuro or contrast lighting predominates, with characters often appearing in silhouette or caught within the contrasting shadows cast by Venetian blinds.  Dark and rainy streets illuminated solely by flickering signs point to a dodgy underworld of corruption that is played out in crowded nightclubs, deserted warehouses, or dingy offices.
Standard noir roles include an isolated, ""hardboiled"" detective and a dangerous female character who proves as duplicitous as she is sharp-tongued and glamorous.  Often, a kind of anti-hero is also featured—a man disillusioned and marginalized, down on his luck, desperate to escape his past, and morally ambivalent—who makes an easy target for the double-crossing woman.  Film noir is also replete with witty and ironic verbal exchanges that heighten the tension between characters who traverse treacherous ground in a hostile universe where fate is inexorable.  Such stylistic tropes, along with morally questionable character types, brought noir into conflict with mid-20th-century American values.
Despite conventions so recognizable they have hardened into clichés that lend themselves to parody, as a genre noir remains indistinct.  Although a few films, such as Double Indemnity and Out of the Past, seem paradigmatic of the style, most vary widely in the degree to which they follow the formula.  Many emphasize or are known for certain conceits: The Big Sleep and The Lady from Shanghai are notorious for the many twists and turns of their incoherent plots; Sunset Boulevard and Gilda for their deceptive female characters; and The Maltese Falcon for introducing the quintessential noir detective, deftly brought to life through the fedora-and-trench-coat-clad character of Sam Spade.
Noir is so notoriously ambiguous and elusive that many films from the era flirt with the classification.  For example, 1941 saw the release of renowned film director Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, a quasi-documentary drama concerning a newspaper magnate, which has long been deemed a masterpiece and is considered noir by some critics.  At the least, it was heavily influential in the development of this film style due to its dark cinematography, enigmatic plot of an investigative nature, voiceover, multiple flashbacks, inventive camera angles, and themes of corruption.  Likewise, the 1942 World War II classic Casablanca features chiaroscuro lighting and flashback; moreover, it takes place in a crowded, urban setting filled with suspicious characters and spotlights a bitter loner haunted by his past.  Given such uncertainty, it is fitting that noir was a label applied only after the heyday of these films ended.",Critical Analysis & Reasoning Skills,6,Humanities

41,Passage Title: Film Noir,"Dominated by stock character types and gloomy urban settings, film noir is a highly stylized art form with plots that pivot around crime and intrigue.  Chiefly a product of 1940s and 1950s Hollywood, noir was arguably more an approach, mood, or sensibility than a discrete genre.  Noir drew inspiration for its scenery from classic movies about bootlegging and heists but primarily imported its storylines and dialogue from the crime novels and pulp magazine tales of the Depression Era.  At the same time, noir imitated the unsettling cinematography of the German expressionist movement of the 1920s and borrowed from French poetic realist cinema a fundamentally jaundiced and tragic worldview.  As an unlikely amalgamation of ideas and styles, film noir also readily absorbed other contemporary cultural strains, notably existentialism and psychoanalysis.
Most noir-type films belong to what is known as the ""B"" movie category—low-budget, black-and-white motion pictures originally produced to accompany a higher-budget or ""A"" film as a double feature—and display certain conventions that give them a distinguishing character.  Apart from a brooding mood, or pervasive sense of pessimism and meaninglessness, noir conventions include the investigation of a crime and a difficult-to-decipher plot unfolding in flashback sequences accompanied by voiceover narration.  Camera angles are distorting and disorienting, creating a sense of menace.  Chiaroscuro or contrast lighting predominates, with characters often appearing in silhouette or caught within the contrasting shadows cast by Venetian blinds.  Dark and rainy streets illuminated solely by flickering signs point to a dodgy underworld of corruption that is played out in crowded nightclubs, deserted warehouses, or dingy offices.
Standard noir roles include an isolated, ""hardboiled"" detective and a dangerous female character who proves as duplicitous as she is sharp-tongued and glamorous.  Often, a kind of anti-hero is also featured—a man disillusioned and marginalized, down on his luck, desperate to escape his past, and morally ambivalent—who makes an easy target for the double-crossing woman.  Film noir is also replete with witty and ironic verbal exchanges that heighten the tension between characters who traverse treacherous ground in a hostile universe where fate is inexorable.  Such stylistic tropes, along with morally questionable character types, brought noir into conflict with mid-20th-century American values.
Despite conventions so recognizable they have hardened into clichés that lend themselves to parody, as a genre noir remains indistinct.  Although a few films, such as Double Indemnity and Out of the Past, seem paradigmatic of the style, most vary widely in the degree to which they follow the formula.

43,Passage Title: The Knights Templar,"The seal of the Knights Templar depicts two knights astride a single horse, a visual testament of the order's poverty at its inception in 1119.  Nevertheless, these Knights of the Temple—who swore oaths not only of poverty but of chastity, loyalty, and bravery—would eventually become one of the wealthiest and most powerful organizations in the medieval world.  So far-reaching was their strength and acclaim that their destruction must have seemed as sudden and surprising as it was utter and irrevocable.  The signs of danger could not have been wholly invisible, however, as the Templars' growing influence became perceived as a threat to European rulers.
The first Templars were nine knights who took an oath to defend the Holy Land and any pilgrims who journeyed there after the First Crusade.  Having secured a small benefice from Jerusalem's King Baldwin II, the knights inaugurated their mission at the site of the great Temple of Solomon.  They quickly attracted widespread admiration as well as many recruits from crusaders and other knights.  Within a year of its founding, the order received a financial endowment from the deeply impressed Count of Anjou, whose example was soon followed by other nobles and monarchs.  As early as 1128, the Templars even gained official papal recognition, and their wealth, holdings, and numbers swelled both in the Holy Land and throughout Europe, especially in France and England.
However, this growing power contained the seeds of the order's downfall.  Although the Templars were generally held in high esteem, the passage of time saw censure and suspicion directed toward them.  The failure of the disastrous siege of Ascalon in 1153 was attributed by some to Templar greed.  Similarly, in 1208 Pope Innocent III condemned the wickedness he believed to exist within their ranks.  Moreover, their increasingly elevated status brought them into conflict with established authorities.  One revealing example occurred in 1252 when, because of the Templars' ""many liberties"" as well as their ""pride and haughtiness,"" England's King Henry III proposed to curb the order's strength by reclaiming some of its possessions.  The Templars' response was unambiguous: ""So long as thou dost exercise justice thou wilt reign; but if thou infringe it, thou wilt cease to be King!""
Ultimately, the impoverished Philip the Fair of France joined forces with Pope Clement V to engineer the Templars' downfall beginning in 1307.  Conspiring to seize the order's wealth, Clement invited the Templar Master, Jacques de Molay, to meet with him on the pretext of organizing a new crusade to retake the Holy Land.  Shortly thereafter, Philip's forces arrested de Molay and his knights on charges the preponderance of which were almost certainly fabricated.  Ranging from the mundane to the unspeakably perverse, the accusations even included an incredible entry citing ""every crime and abomination that can be committed.""  Suffering tortures nearly as horrific as the acts of which they were accused, many Templars confessed.
Not everyone believed these charges.  Despite Philip's urging, Edward II of England remained convinced that the accusations were false, a view seemingly shared by other rulers.  Nevertheless, Clement ordered Edward to extract confessions, a task the king tried to carry out with some measure of mercy.  By 1313, the Templar Order had been dissolved by papal decree, and many of its members were dead.  The following year, Jacques de Molay was burned at the stake after declaring that the Templars' confessions were lies obtained under torture.  Stories would spread that as he died, he condemned Clement and Philip to join him within a year.  Although it is impossible to say whether he truly called divine vengeance down upon them, within a few months' time both pope and king had gone to their graves.",Critical Analysis & Reasoning Skills,4,Social Sciences

48,Passage Title: Making the Liberty Bell,"What would later be known as the Liberty Bell initially had no specific connection to American freedom.  In fact, the Whitechapel Foundry of London created the original bell in 1751, at the request of the State House of colonial Philadelphia.  When the bell finally arrived several months later, the assembled onlookers' anticipation turned to horror as it was rung and immediately cracked.  The Philadelphians accused the Whitechapel Foundry of poor workmanship, while Foundry workers countered that the Philadelphians caused the crack by ringing the bell incorrectly.
Although the Foundry's response might seem like a flimsy excuse, that impression would be misleading.  According to Hanson et al. in a metallurgical study, ""Despite the massive appearance of large bells, they are quite fragile, and cracking may result from inferior casting techniques and vibrational stresses produced by improper ringing.""  The study further explains that ""[t]he optimum composition for bell metal was considered to be about 77% copper and 23% tin.  Alloys containing higher amounts of tin are brittle and thus unsuitable for large bells.""  Therefore, it would have seemed plausible at the time that either party could potentially have been responsible for the bell's damage.
The above ratio of metals comports fairly closely with knowledge from hundreds of years prior, as a twelfth-century set of instructions specifies that bells should be composed of four parts copper and one part tin to possess sufficient structural integrity.  In addition to these durability requirements, medieval bell-makers had also identified the correct ratios between the components of a bell to produce the desired tone, based on the thickness of its soundbow, the area struck by the bell's clapper.  The diameter of the bell's mouth should be fifteen times the thickness of the soundbow, and its upper portion or shoulder seven and a half times that thickness.  Likewise, the height from shoulder to mouth should be twelve times the thickness of the soundbow.
Thus, aside from minor refinements, the process of casting large bells has remained relatively unchanged for centuries.  An inner mould or core is constructed of brick, then covered with clay, animal hair, and manure.  The core is wound with rope, which, when later removed, creates the space for the metal.  The cope or outer mould is shaped around the core, while a third mould for the bell's crown is fitted over the top.  The entire construction is then encased in the ground, leaving two holes to pour the liquid bronze while allowing air to escape.  After several days of cooling, the new bell is ready for final tuning.
In the case of the Liberty Bell, Philadelphia brass workers Pass and Stow were commissioned to recast the cracked contribution from Whitechapel in 1753.  Melting the original bell down, the men added several pounds of copper to strengthen the alloy and prevent another crack.  This process was successful but the bell's tone was subpar, so they recast the bell again before it entered into service.  Its most famous ringing was on July 8, 1776, when its peals announced the signing of the Declaration of Independence.  It was also rung on other significant occasions, including the funeral of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1835, when it cracked once again.
In the years before the Civil War, abolitionists adopted the ""Liberty Bell"" as a symbol representing liberation from slavery.  However, it is arguably remembered more today for its now iconic crack.  In 1960, drillings taken from the Liberty Bell were found to contain about 73% copper and 24% tin, with small amounts of lead and other elements composing the rest of the alloy.  A 1975 analysis using fluorescent X-rays further revealed that the bell's chemical composition varies at different points along its surface, shedding additional light on the reasons for the bell's structural failure.",Critical Analysis & Reasoning Skills,4,Humanities

The Philadelphians accused the Whitechapel Foundry of poor workmanship, while Foundry workers countered that the Philadelphians caused the crack by ringing the bell incorrectly.
Although the Foundry's response might seem like a flimsy excuse, that impression would be misleading.  According to Hanson et al. in a metallurgical study, ""Despite the massive appearance of large bells, they are quite fragile, and cracking may result from inferior casting techniques and vibrational stresses produced by improper ringing.""  The study further explains that ""[t]he optimum composition for bell metal was considered to be about 77% copper and 23% tin.  Alloys containing higher amounts of tin are brittle and thus unsuitable for large bells.""  Therefore, it would have seemed plausible at the time that either party could potentially have been responsible for the bell's damage.
The above ratio of metals comports fairly closely with knowledge from hundreds of years prior, as a twelfth-century set of instructions specifies that bells should be composed of four parts copper and one part tin to possess sufficient structural integrity.  In addition to these durability requirements, medieval bell-makers had also identified the correct ratios between the components of a bell to produce the desired tone, based on the thickness of its soundbow, the area struck by the bell's clapper.  The diameter of the bell's mouth should be fifteen times the thickness of the soundbow, and its upper portion or shoulder seven and a half times that thickness.  Likewise, the height from shoulder to mouth should be twelve times the thickness of the soundbow.
Thus, aside from minor refinements, the process of casting large bells has remained relatively unchanged for centuries.  An inner mould or core is constructed of brick, then covered with clay, animal hair, and manure.  The core is wound with rope, which, when later removed, creates the space for the metal.  The cope or outer mould is shaped around the core, while a third mould for the bell's crown is fitted over the top.  The entire construction is then encased in the ground, leaving two holes to pour the liquid bronze while allowing air to escape.  After several days of cooling, the new bell is ready for final tuning.
In the case of the Liberty Bell, Philadelphia brass workers Pass and Stow were commissioned to recast the cracked contribution from Whitechapel in 1753.  Melting the original bell down, the men added several pounds of copper to strengthen the alloy and prevent another crack.  This process was successful but the bell's tone was subpar, so they recast the bell again before it entered into service.  Its most famous ringing was on July 8, 1776, when its peals announced the signing of the Declaration of Independence.  It was also rung on other significant occasions, including the funeral of Chief Justice John Marshall in 1835, when it cracked once again.
In the years before the Civil War, abolitionists adopted the ""Liberty Bell"" as a symbol representing liberation from slavery.  However, it is arguably remembered more today for its now iconic crack.

53,Passage Title: Shang Dynasty Oracle Bone Inscriptions,"The earliest documentation of Chinese religious belief comes from the oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang dynasty, which, intriguingly, the newest archaeological evidence has now dated to approximately 1554–1040 B.C.E.  These inscriptions reveal several aspects of Shang spiritual practice, which was dominated by attempts to divine the future and to secure the aid of various natural and supernatural powers.
The term ""oracle bone inscriptions"" derives from the method the Shang used to seek guidance from the spiritual world.  An animal bone, most commonly a tortoise shell or cow scapula, would be inscribed with a statement, such as ""on the tenth day, there will be rain"" or ""we should go to battle.""  The shell or bone was then exposed to a heated piece of metal, and the king would interpret the resulting cracks as either affirming or denying the inscription.  Usually, the king's pronouncement would then be recorded.
In some cases, the outcome of the king's forecast was also inscribed—however, these cases were almost always when the king had been correct in his divination.  This fact could be seen as evidence that the primary function of the oracle bones was to legitimize the king's authority.  For instance, regarding an inscription that ""there will be no disasters,"" the Shang ruler Wu Ding interpreted the oracular cracks negatively and predicted that ""alarming news"" would soon arrive.  Four days later, the pronouncement was viewed as confirmed when a messenger reported attacks on two settlements.  The king's important role as an intermediary between the divine and physical realms was therefore reinforced.
However, legitimation of royal authority could not have been the only function of the divination process, as there are a limited number of records in which a king failed to predict the future accurately.  In addition, the sheer number and scope of inscriptions suggest that the Shang took otherworldly powers very seriously, and sincerely believed in their ability to affect human life.
The greatest of these powers was Di (or Shangdi), the high god of the Shang.  Able to send or withhold rain and wind, bring fortune or misfortune upon the land, grant military assistance, or even induce other peoples to attack China, Di was seen as essential to the country's well-being.  As a result, one might naturally expect Di to have been the subject of elaborate rituals and sacrifices.  In fact, however, there were no such ceremonies for Di.  Di was viewed as distant from the people and willing to harm as well as aid them throughout various times.  Because of this seeming ambivalence, the Shang instead sought to incur Di's favor through the intercession of their deceased kings.  While these kings were not as powerful as Di, they could bestow some measure of blessing (or bane) upon the living ruler and his subjects.  Moreover, as former humans themselves, they were considered more approachable by the petitioners who sought their aid.
A third group of powers comprised natural spirits, such as the Yellow River Power or the Great Winds.  These forces lacked the direct control over events that Di possessed; however, they did have some influence over natural phenomena.  Hence, both for such powers and for the ancestor kings, some oracle bone inscriptions described a wish and an attempt to gain an entity's favor; for example, ""to the Mountain we pray for rain and offer a burnt sacrifice.""
The frequency and prominence of oracle bone inscriptions, as well as their emphasis on the role of divine forces, evince a high degree of spiritual concern in the time of the Shang dynasty.

57,Passage Title: The Great Sphinx,"Accompanied by his army and a retinue of scientists and scholars, Napoleon arrived in Egypt in 1798 on his campaign to control the eastern Mediterranean.  On the Giza Plateau, several miles from Cairo, he encountered a massive stone head protruding from the sands, displaying an Egyptian royal headdress and a badly damaged nose.  In the wake of Napoleon's exploits, tales of such archaeological wonders swept across Europe, giving rise to Egyptomania.  In 1817, Italian Egyptologist Giovanni Battista Caviglia led the first modern archaeological dig to rescue the monument from the desert sands.  The recumbent body of a lion was revealed to be supporting the colossal pharaoh head, and the monument became known as the Great Sphinx.  Artifacts from various time periods show that the statue had been dug out no fewer than 6 previous times, the last at the order of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius in AD 160.  However, the Sphinx's body would not be completely freed until French Egyptologist Emile Baraize conducted extensive excavations of the monument and surrounding area in 1926.
Thought to date back 4,500 years, the Great Sphinx is the oldest monolithic statue in the world.  It is also the largest, measuring 241 ft long, 63 ft wide, and 66 ft high.  As part lion, the creature most associated with kingship and the sun, the statue served to concretize the pharaoh's identification with Re, the great Egyptian solar deity.
The Sphinx is part of a complex of structures on the plateau including the Great Pyramid, the Causeway, the Sphinx Temple, and the Valley Temple.  Believed to be dedicated to the 4th Dynasty pharaoh Khafre, the complex formed a necropolis with the Sphinx as guardian.  Interestingly, these prodigious stone structures were built not by slaves, as commonly assumed, but by Egyptian civil servants who held a privileged position in society.
Unlike the head of the Sphinx, which is solid, the limestone rock from which the body was carved is friable and prone to disintegration.  Consequently, it has been restored numerous times beginning in antiquity.  Notably, the forepaws of the Sphinx enclose an open temple containing a stele or stone slab.  Dating from circa 1400 BC, the inscription on the stele relates how the god Re appeared in a dream to the young Egyptian prince Thutmose IV, promising that if he dug the Sphinx out of the sand, he would be crowned Pharaoh of Upper and Lower Egypt.  Archaeological evidence confirms that Thutmose not only freed the Sphinx but, having discovered that some of the stones of its body had fallen off, restored them to their proper place and filled in damaged areas.  Lastly, Thutmose had a wall built around the area of the Sphinx, its mudbricks inscribed with his name.
Focus on conservation has stimulated controversy over the statue's age.  An alternative theory dates the original construction of the Sphinx back to 7000 BC or earlier.  Some experts claim that wind and sand would not have caused the pattern of erosion seen on the Sphinx's lower body; more likely, it was the effect of heavy and repeated rainfalls on the limestone.  While many scholars dispute this theory, geological studies have revealed that the Giza Plateau, which sits on the edge of the Sahara Desert, had a few millennia before been a rich and fertile plain subject to frequent precipitation.
Contemporary Egyptologists were dismayed when, in 1988, a piece of the Sphinx's shoulder collapsed onto the ground.  Reconstructive efforts on the statue were accelerated and continue to this day, guided by advances in science and technology.  Despite the increased attention, the Sphinx has not yet revealed all its secrets but remains an archaeological riddle.",Critical Analysis & Reasoning Skills,4,Humanities

Lastly, Thutmose had a wall built around the area of the Sphinx, its mudbricks inscribed with his name.
Focus on conservation has stimulated controversy over the statue's age.  An alternative theory dates the original construction of the Sphinx back to 7000 BC or earlier.  Some experts claim that wind and sand would not have caused the pattern of erosion seen on the Sphinx's lower body; more likely, it was the effect of heavy and repeated rainfalls on the limestone.  While many scholars dispute this theory, geological studies have revealed that the Giza Plateau, which sits on the edge of the Sahara Desert, had a few millennia before been a rich and fertile plain subject to frequent precipitation.
Contemporary Egyptologists were dismayed when, in 1988, a piece of the Sphinx's shoulder collapsed onto the ground.  Reconstructive efforts on the statue were accelerated and continue to this day, guided by advances in science and technology.

60,Passage Title: The Great Sphinx,"Accompanied by his army and a retinue of scientists and scholars, Napoleon arrived in Egypt in 1798 on his campaign to control the eastern Mediterranean.  On the Giza Plateau, several miles from Cairo, he encountered a massive stone head protruding from the sands, displaying an Egyptian royal headdress and a badly damaged nose.  In the wake of Napoleon's exploits, tales of such archaeological wonders swept across Europe, giving rise to Egyptomania.  In 1817, Italian Egyptologist Giovanni Battista Caviglia led the first modern archaeological dig to rescue the monument from the desert sands.  The recumbent body of a lion was revealed to be supporting the colossal pharaoh head, and the monument became known as the Great Sphinx.  Artifacts from various time periods show that the statue had been dug out no fewer than 6 previous times, the last at the order of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius in AD 160.  However, the Sphinx's body would not be completely freed until French Egyptologist Emile Baraize conducted extensive excavations of the monument and surrounding area in 1926.
Thought to date back 4,500 years, the Great Sphinx is the oldest monolithic statue in the world.  It is also the largest, measuring 241 ft long, 63 ft wide, and 66 ft high.  As part lion, the creature most associated with kingship and the sun, the statue served to concretize the pharaoh's identification with Re, the great Egyptian solar deity.
The Sphinx is part of a complex of structures on the plateau including the Great Pyramid, the Causeway, the Sphinx Temple, and the Valley Temple.  Believed to be dedicated to the 4th Dynasty pharaoh Khafre, the complex formed a necropolis with the Sphinx as guardian.  Interestingly, these prodigious stone structures were built not by slaves, as commonly assumed, but by Egyptian civil servants who held a privileged position in society.
Unlike the head of the Sphinx, which is solid, the limestone rock from which the body was carved is friable and prone to disintegration.  Consequently, it has been restored numerous times beginning in antiquity.  Notably, the forepaws of the Sphinx enclose an open temple containing a stele or stone slab.

62,Passage Title: Everyday Heidegger,"When twentieth-century German thinker Martin Heidegger contemplated the history of philosophy in the West, he noticed something astonishing: it seemed to have forgotten the most fundamental of all philosophical questions, the question of Being.  After all, what does it mean to be, or to say that something exists?  Moreover, he wondered, why are we not more perplexed by this perplexity?
Heidegger tackled such questions in Being and Time—a nearly impenetrable work apt to frustrate and flummox the reader at every turn.  In this tortured and intimidating tome, Heidegger strung words into hyphenated chains to build terms better befitting his dense ideas and dared to target the lofty towers of traditional Western metaphysical thought.  Above all, he believed that the revered triumvirate of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle had diverted the course of philosophy by turning away from ontology, or the study of Being, toward a metaphysics that merely pondered the nature of individual entities.  Furthermore, Heidegger thought that Descartes, as the first modern philosopher, had exacerbated this misguided focus.  In struggling to establish a foundation for knowledge, Descartes had posited his existence as the precondition of the only thing he could not doubt—the fact of his own thinking.  However, in Heidegger's estimation, Descartes seemed to overlook the fact that existence itself presupposes an already suitable context, or meaningfully structured situation, in which to exist.  While this Cartesian paradigm effectively severed self from world and subject from object, Heidegger adopted a nondualistic, phenomenological approach wherein perceiver and perceived are interdependent.  He also began his quest for the meaning of Being with ordinary, everyday experience, with what it means to dwell within the world as a human being—the only being sufficiently aware of its own existence to question it.
Accordingly, Heidegger sought to gain an understanding of Being by analyzing the inherent structures of our basic ontological condition, the reality of our distinctively human existence or mode of Being, which he referred to as Dasein—a term roughly translated as ""being there.""  Heidegger saw Dasein's primary structure as ""thrownness"": we are summarily tossed into the world and into a particular configuration of circumstances that impose limitations but also provide possibilities.  Overall, we belong to a world that is exquisitely attuned to us and toward which we, in turn, are uniquely disposed.  This existential condition of ""being-in-the-world"" implies complete engagement with our environment: we are inextricably entangled and deeply invested in its intricate web of people and things.  Moreover, in the day-to-day business of living, we play shifting roles within countless contexts and subcontexts that form an interactive, seamlessly integrated totality of which we are the co-creators.
Consequently, we are interconnected not only socially but ""equipmentally.""  The world is filled with objects we can manipulate for a variety of purposes.  For example, a hammer is typically not an object we stop and analyze but a tool we pick up and use, experiencing it more as an extension of our hand than an ontologically distinct entity.  Therefore, the hammer's common mode of Being is usefulness—in Heideggerian terminology, it is ""ready-to-hand"" rather than merely ""present-at-hand.""  Likewise, a boat on the water is only secondarily an object for observation and interpretation.  It functions primarily as a piece of equipment within a nexus of related such items that might include oars, fishing tackle, and life preservers.  Furthermore, the vessel operates within many possible domains—boatbuilding, fish markets, travel—and might be used in sundry activities by diverse individuals.
Thus, in trying to ""call us back to the remembrance of Being,"" so long consigned to oblivion, and to overturn Western philosophy, Heidegger pitched ordinary experience into the ontological register, grounding metaphysics in everyday reality.",Critical Analysis & Reasoning Skills,4,Humanities
